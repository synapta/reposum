10.14210/contrapontos.v16n2.p321-350,THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF THE REGGIO EMILIA PHILOSOPHY,"This article presents the history and framework of the Reggio Emilia philosophy, an educational approach to early childhood education that places children as the main participants and protagonists of the curriculum. It also showcases the growing influence of the Reggio Emilia philosophy around the world, through key regional and national organizations. The association of the Emilia fundamental values of the Reggio Emilia with the globally competent soft skills helps this philosophy to overcome the growing need worldwide. Ultimately, the internationalization of this approach has inspired teaching practices all over the world. Within different nations, organizations that advocate the application of Reggio Emilia principles in various schools has grown, prompting a need to educate children to that they will develop emotionally and cognitively, in making thinking visible."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199742844.013.003,Naturalism and Skepticism in the Philosophy of Hume,"Hume takes his “naturalistic” study of human nature to show that certain general “principles of the imagination” can explain how human beings come to think, feel, believe, and act in all the ways they do independently of the truth or reasonableness of those responses. This appears to leave the reflective philosopher with no reason for assenting to what he has discovered he cannot help believing anyway. Relief from this unacceptably extreme skepticism is found in acknowledging and acquiescing in those forces of “nature” that inevitably overcome the apparent dictates of “reason” and return the philosopher to the responses and beliefs of everyday life. Living in full recognition of these forces and limitations is what Hume means by the “mitigated scepticism” he accepts."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199642342.013.039,Philosophy of Number,"There are many kinds of number. This chapter concentrates on finite cardinal numbers, as they have a basic role in our thinking. Numbers cannot be seen, heard, touched, tasted, or smelled; they do not emit or reflect signals; they leave no traces. So what kind of thing are they? How can we have knowledge of them? The aim of this chapter is to present and assess the main answers to these questions – classical and neo-classical, nominalism, mentalism, fictionalism, logicism, and the set-size view. All views are disputed, including the view I will argue for, the set-size view. The final section relates the finite cardinal numbers to the natural numbers."

The presentation of Hume’s account is threefold. The first section of the paper elucidates the nature of sympathy, drawing on some of the more recent ways in which Hume’s commentators have attempted to resolve the interpretive puzzles Hume’s works present. The second section explicates some of the functions sympathy has in Hume’s philosophy, including not only three that have been particularly prominent in the secondary literature, but also two others that have received considerably less attention. The final section summarizes Hume’s account of the nature and functions of sympathy and briefly suggests some of the ways in which these aspects of Hume’s moral psychology seem to be supported by contemporary psychological research."

Although we don't see this term support in any theory or philosophy what it makes difficult to discuss the humanization in a scientific level. This philosophical essay aims to reflect about the term humanization proposing a concept based in Emmanuel Lévinas philosophy. We propose the ""relation I-other as an on the care act"" concept. The choice for the levinasian philosophy to fundament the concept is because the health careers finality and complexity that involves the careers knowledge's and makes. In the relation I-another proposed by Lévinas the other appear as an absolute otherness and the I as a passive subjectivity. Despite their relation they continue completely separated: the other requires cares and the I answers it the requests. The I-health professional answer becomes human because was affected by the otherness in the same time expresses the unknowable and supplicates for justice."

10.11649/sm.2014.012,Experiencing historical time: Apocalypse and authoritarianism in inter-war Bulgarian existential philosophy,"Experiencing historical time: Apocalypse and authoritarianism in inter-war Bulgarian existential philosophyThis article deals with the sense of the pace of time as reflected in the works of Bulgarian philosophers from the “philosophy of life” school, and of other thinkers active in the humanities. It is shown that the feeling of “condensed” time among the authors of the inter-war period is inevitably associated with Biblical imagery – the “reduction” of time foresees the end of time. Several authors left a lasting mark on Bulgarian intellectual history due to their sensitivity to the sharp turns of the age, and their awareness of the intense “flow” of time.The most prominent among tchem were Spiridon Kazandjiev and Yanko Yanev, authors with right-wing political leanings. This article reveals how the end of time provoked in them not only distress and anxiety but also exhilaration at what lay ahead, as if it were the realisation of a longcherished dream. Doświadczanie czasu historycznego. Apokalipsa i autorytaryzm w bułgarskiej filozofii egzystencjalnej okresu międzywojennegoNiniejszy artykuł poświęcony jest doświadczeniu tempa czasu, odzwierciedlonemu w twórczości bułgarskich filozofów sytuujących się w nurcie „filozofii życia” w najszerszym ze znaczeń, jak również innych myślicieli. Zostaje w nim pokazane, jak poczucie czasu „skon­densowanego” u autorów okresu międzywojennego nieodzownie kojarzone jest z obrazami biblijnymi – czas „zredukowany” zapowiada zbliżający się koniec.Myśliciele, którzy pozostawiają trwałe ślady w bułgarskiej historii intelektualistów właśnie w powodu swej wrażliwości na gwałtowne zwroty w czasie, na intensywność jego upływu, to m.in. Spirydon Kazandżijew [Спиридон Казанджиев], Janko Janew [Янко Янев], Najden Szejtanow [Найден Шейтанов] – autorzy o orientacji prawicowej. Artykuł ukazuje, jak „koniec czasów” budzi u nich nie tylko udrękę i niepokój, ale i podekscytowanie z powodu tego, co nadchodzi – pojmowanego jako urzeczywistnienie długo pielęgnowanego marzenia."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199742844.013.15,Hume’s Political Philosophy,"Although David Hume never produced a single comprehensive work that encapsulated his views on politics, his various writings address a broad range of topics of relevance to political philosophy. He critiques the social contract theory of Hobbes and Locke, and he offers an alternative, evolutionary account of the origins of government. Hume sees all governments as the result of a struggle between authority and liberty, with the best of them achieving a balance between the two by implementing systems of “general laws.” Hume’s cautious approach to social change may fairly be called conservative. However, he is willing to endorse efforts at gradual reform when these efforts do not threaten the stability of the society. His legacy for modern political philosophy remains contested."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199742844.013.31,Hume and Smith on Moral Philosophy,"Scholars of eighteenth-century Scottish philosophy today tend to agree that Adam Smith, while deeply indebted to Hume, was also engaged in a comprehensive and creative transformation and extension of certain of Hume’s fundamental concepts. But what exactly did Smith take from Hume, and precisely how did he transform these concepts? This chapter traces Smith’s appropriation and transformation along five fronts: sympathy and humanity, justice and utility, judgment and impartiality, virtue and commercial society, and epistemology and religion. In so doing, it aims to provide a synthetic account of previous scholarship on the Hume–Smith relationship and to supplement these accounts with an examination of several further points of contact that have yet to receive significant attention."
10.1017/s1477175614000207,THE END OF PHILOSOPHY,"Philosophy's role is typically a reflective one. Yet this stance is in peril of being corrupted. Because it is being driven to specialized inquiries, the subdisciplines of which it is comprised may develop into separate fields, whose presence will then need to be justified in the same way the sciences are. This is impossible, however, given their diverging objectives. If this course of action persist, philosophy's end in the sense of its ending is imminent, on account of its no longer having an end in the sense of its objective."

Author argues that in pre-modern worldview there were no conceptual conditions which made transgression possible. In modern and especially postmodern de-enchanted world a real transgression is a creative work which goes beyond the limitations of exclusive humanism. Among the discussed authors are: Ch. Taylor, D.

10.1075/bpjam.17.04tri,Stoicism and Byzantine philosophy: Proairesis in Epictetus and Nicephorus Blemmydes,"Was the Byzantine thinker Nicephorus Blemmydes (1197–1272) directly influenced in his views about human “proairesis” by the Stoic Epictetus (50–138 AD) or did he take over his views from the Neoplatonic Simplicius? After exploring Blemmydes’ reception of Epictetus, one can say that Blemmydes drew elements in a brief treatise under the title “De virtute et ascesi” from the mainly Neoplatonic Simplicius, who commented on the handbook by the Stoic Epictetus (50–138 AD). Blemmydes, following Simplicius identifies “ἐφ’ ἡμῖν” with “aftexousion” and he designates “proairesis” as an activity, which emanates from “aftexousion”. Blemmydes shows the moral power of “proairesis” as a transforming factor of human existence and the mediatory factor to the dialectical relation between man and God. For the completion of the study, the following sources have been used: Blemmydes’ De virtute et ascesi, Epictetus’ Handbook, and Neoplatonic Simplicius’ commentaries on the Handbook. I specifically focus on the views of Aristotle, Epictetus, and Neoplatonic Simplicius about “proairesis” and compare the views of Blemmydes to Simplicius’ ideas. I conclude that Blemmydes drew ideas from Simplicius, with regard to human “proairesis” and in the context of the practising and cultivating virtues in everyday life."
10.2478/opth-2014-0008,The Pioneering Appearances of Philosophy of Religion in Europe: François Para du Phanjas on the Nature of Religion,"AbstractPhilosophy is, in some sense, the self-reflection of general culture, and perpetual self-reflection has been a primary occupation of philosophy in the West. Consequently, self-reflection is of great importance for dividing philosophical fields into separate divisions, and philosophy of religion is no exception. This paper deals with a thinker who constructed a “philosophy of religion” as a discipline, but was overlooked by historians. The main achievements of François Para du Phanjas (1724-1797), who tried to offer a theory of religion in the theological context, have not lost their significance for today, especially his insights into epistemology of religious beliefs, his conception of “certainty” and classification of “religious evidences”, and the shortcomings of his analysis of “natural religion”."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199314621.013.5,Comparison or Confluence In Philosophy?,"This chapter examines the project of fusion or confluence philosophy: philosophizing that draws on resources from both Indian and Western philosophical traditions in seeking solutions to philosophical problems. A distinction is drawn between the confluence project and the project of comparative philosophy. Various challenges to the project are addressed, among them the criticism that the two traditions are incommensurable, and the charge that such a project is politically problematic. There is also discussion of some ways in which projects of this sort can go astray. Representative samples of the genre are discussed, and areas that might prove promising for future research are identified."
10.14507/epaa.v19n2.2011,"Ways to live history. Or philosophy, culture, and architecture in the origins of the museum Altes in Berlín","From the beginnings of what we now know as our modernity, man has been surprised with his own finitude. The 18th and 19th  century bourgeois needed to formulate complex ways of preserving the past and of linking with it. In the philosophes’ circle, time concept starts to double itself in the idea of origin, that, for them, had become opaque. We just need to think of the broad-range process of structuring museums and restructuring natural history collections in cities such as Paris and Berlin, around the turn to the 19th century, so that we can be convinced that the surprise with that origin that one cannot recognize anymore, that becomes object of popular and scientific interest, leads each and all of the decisions in this process. Museum is just one of the institutions in which man, through a complex series of idealizations of space, show himself the spectacle of a lost time and, thus, of a culture whose educational thrive can only be understood by associating to these institutions. Our task is to investigate – and the case study of the grounding of the Altes Museum in Berlin, between 1822 and 1830, will perform this concretely – which educational policy made the emergence of this new ideological model possible, and , on the opposite way, which conceptual elaborations confirmed or legitimated the new pragmatic topography of time in modernity within the institution that had as aim, precisely, articulate and administrate past and memory."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199742844.013.35,Reflexivity and Sentiment in Hume’s Philosophy,"This contribution is concerned with what Hume means by reflection and sentiment. Hume’s Treatise is devoted to an account of the extent to which the mind is able to bear its own reflexion or turn mental states on themselves. This theme is likely the “new scene of thought” that inspired Hume’s major concerns in the Treatise. Although Hume found that the understanding fails to understand itself, the passions do better in satisfying curiosity about curiosity, and, most importantly, moral sentiment is able to approve of itself. The author contends that the whole task of the moral sentiment is to get us to fulfill our part to mankind and society, and that, according to Hume, the sentiments are the noble source of morality itself."
10.1515/zac-2012-0012,Conversion to Christian Philosophy—the case of Origen’s School in Caesarea,"In this article I will discuss whether the teaching and preaching of Origen should be understood as aiming at a conversion to philosophy. The idea that Origen’s teaching can be understood this way is inspired by Gregor Thaumaturgus-or Gregory the Wonderworker as he is called in English.1 In his address2 to Origen and his fellow pupils when he left Origen’s school in Caesarea Gregory describes what happened to him in Origen’s school as a kind of conversion. Reading Gregory’s address one can get the impression that his conversion was a conversion to philosophy more than a conversion to Christianity or to a certain kind of Christian theology. In a shorter form, Eusebius mentions something similar. At this background it is reasonable to ask what Gregory could have meant by his description, and whether such a description of Origen’s work can be confirmed and substantiated by Origen’s own writings. I will focus on Origen’s activities in Caesarea, but these will be seen in the context of what we know about his own education and his teaching in Alexandria in the period before he moved to Caesarea."
10.1017/s0003055415000076,Philosophy and Poetry: A New Look At An Old Quarrel,"The subordination of poetry to rational guidance has been denounced as a symptom of a specifically Western sickness, with its origin in Plato'sRepublic. But Plato's disposition to the poets is more complex than is often supposed. Although Book Three's education in civic virtue includes a call for an austere, civic poetry, in Book Ten Socrates finds the wisdom of this provision to need a serious reconsideration, one made necessary because philosophy has emerged as the true answer to the search for a genuinely fulfilling, happy life. Book Ten's reconsideration quietly shows that great poets like Homer are wiser than the earlier examination had suggested, especially about death, and are even indistinguishable from Socratic philosophers in their understanding of and disposition toward death and so in the related matter of the best human life."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199696383.013.10,"Freedom, Reason, and Art in Idealist and Romantic Philosophy","Concentrating on ‘The Oldest System-Programme of German Idealism’, this chapter argues that the significance of aesthetics for modern philosophy is adumbrated in Idealist and Romantic philosophical texts in ways which have often not been adequately appreciated. It is notoriously difficult to characterize Romanticism conclusively, but it undoubtedly has to do with tensions in the way the modern world is understood in the differing spheres of modern science, modern law and the state, and modern art. The difference between broadly construed German Idealist and early German Romantic philosophy is that the former seeks a philosophical account of how unity can be articulated through division, whereas the latter (exemplified by Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel) sees such unity as only accessible at all in our sense of failure when we strive to achieve definitive unity."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199314621.013.31,Mādhava’s Garland of Jaimini’s Reasons as Exemplary Mīmāṃsā Philosophy,"This chapter examines the Jaiminīyanyāyamālā (Garland of Jaimini’s Reasons) of Mādhava (1297–1388) as an example of Mīmāṃsā philosophy. It asks what Mīmāṃsā thinkers find philosophically problematic or interesting in the Sūtra before discussing what in Mīmāṃsā is most properly and usefully characterized as “Mīmāṃsā philosophy.” It considers the traditional themes thought to characterize each Adhyāya, or book, of the Sūtra to show that Mīmāṃsā reading and reasoning is grounded in case-studies and that it is like another form of textual reasoning, that of rabbinic tradition. In particular, it analyzes Jacob Neusner’s views on whether Mishnah, or any similar system, is philosophical. The chapter proceeds by turning to the Garland and Mādhava’s purpose in this work. It compares the Garland to Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations and argues that Mādhava is a philosopher of a certain kind, and his Garland a philosophical text committed to rational inquiry."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935314.013.33,The Philosophy of Quantum Field Theory,"This is an opinionated survey of some interpretive puzzles in quantum field theory. The problem of inequivalent representations is sketched, including its connections with competing accounts of physical equivalence. The controversy between variant formulations of the theory, algebraic versus Lagrangian, is given a conciliatory resolution. Arguments against particles are addressed, demarcating clearly between different forms of particle interpretation. Field interpretations are then considered, including wavefunctional, spacetime state realist and Heisenberg operator realist interpretations. Ruetsche’s coalesced structure interpretation is presented and juxtaposed with an alternative, more traditional view of the theory’s laws and state space. Finally, the CPT theorem is discussed, together with its implications about the nature of spacetime."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199935390.013.70,Greek Philosophy in the Twenty-first Century,"This article addresses contemporary efforts to understand how the earliest practitioners of philosophy conceived of the philosophic life. It argues that, for Plato, the concept of bios was a central, animating, and structuring object of philosophic inquiry. Concentration on the imagery Plato employed to draw bios into the purview of philosophic contemplation and choice points to interpretative avenues that further the aim of treating the dialogues as complex, integrated wholes, and offers a new approach to the question of the status of image-making in them. The article concludes with thoughts on how an exploration of bios might extend beyond Plato to Aristotle, via an examination of his treatment of the range of human and animal bioi, suggesting that such an examination clarifies the relationship between his analysis of the polis-dwelling animal and his broader investigation of living beings as such."
10.1017/s0252921100087200,Philosophy and Directions in Planetarium Programming,"I am going to start with the premise that planetariums serve several roles in their communities:1. They are popularizers of astronomy and space science2. They support and enhance the teaching of astronomy and related subjects within the formal education system3. They provide a community resource for astronomical informationNot all planetariums incorporate all of these roles or do so to the same degree.Planetariums, as facilities, come in a variety of forms. At one extreme might be a space theater with its wide-format films. A major public facility would have a strong emphasis on public shows and school programming. A college or school facility would emphasize programming for the education system at some or all levels with some or no public programs. At the other extreme would be the small portable planetariums with 100 per cent use for school activities."
10.1017/s0031819100033210,New Science and Old Philosophy,"Cast a backward glance over the last hundred years and it will be seen at once where the greatest advance has been. We cannot claim, I fear, that it has been in philosophy. Nor yet has it been in the sphere of religion; nor in politics; nor in the arts. Plainly enough, it is in science that this age has excelled; and in industrial production through the help of science."
10.1017/s0031819100033258,The Philosophy of Maimonides and its Systematic Place in the History of Philosophy,"Moses Maimondes, born March 30, 1135, the eight hundredth anniversary of whose birth we now commemorate, is one of those universal spirits who mastered the whole realm of knowledge of their time. His fruitful and extensive literary activity covered many fields: astronomy, medicine, Talmud, and philosophy. His works on medicine were in former tunes highly esteemed. In the field of philosophy he strove for the synthesis of Aristotelianism and revealed religion, an endeavour which was of paramount importance for the later development of philosophic thought. His influence as a philosopher is not confined to the sphere of Jewish thought, but has left a lasting impression on the history of philosophy in general."
10.1017/s0031819100033283,Philosophy in France,"History and Legend are, Professor Robin believes, traditionally misconceived in being conceived as in conflict. To write history is either to destroy utterly the claim of some legend to be veridical, or else to rediscover, behind what is imaginary or fabulous in it, indications of what the facts really were. Such is the accredited view. But, asks M. Robin, is not legend, on the contrary, a positive element in history? And he answers in effect that nowhere is legend more regular, indeed more necessary, than in its contribution to the history of philosophy, ancient and modern. This history has a wholly original character. It does not resemble the history of the sciences; for this relates either the checkmates in research—instructive to be sure, but dead for future science—or else its victories—equally instructive, though only their results survive. Nor does it resemble literary history; for even if this be accompanied by evaluatory criticism, seldom is interpretation of doctrine admitted. Interpreting a philosophy is seizing not only its literal sense, but above all its import and efficacy. It is a continuously creative and reflective activity which unceasingly quickens the materials on which it reflects. But since what is called objectivity cannot be attained by the historian of philosophy except by shutting his eyes to the limits of his powers, he must candidly confess—and without admitting that the confession impairs the value of his effort—that objectivity cannot be his chief end. No great philosophy can really be considered dead, its sincere and sympathetic evocationisalways possible. The history of philosophy is philosophy; it is philosophy philosophizing on its past efforts, and contemplating itself in the perenniality of its changing existence."
10.1017/s0031819100033295,Philosophy in Germany,"Karl Popper's aim inLogik der Forschungis to consider the method of investigation used by the empirical sciences. Many people would say that their procedure is marked by the use of induction, and accordingly that the logic of scientific investigation is the logical analysis of induction. But Popper disagrees. Scientific procedure consists of two steps, an hypothesis is formed, and then it is tested. Logic is only concerned with questions of validity, and thus is only concerned with the second of these steps. But every method of testing validity is deductive, and thus the logic of scientific investigation is the study of deduction as used by the empirical sciences."
10.1515/humaff-2016-0028,Rorty’s philosophy of religion,"AbstractRichard Rorty interpreted religion as a historically constituted part of culture. As a philosopher, he sought primarily to understand religion’s socio-cultural nature and role. His approach was socio-critical, intellectually sympathetic and humanistic. The paper provides an account of Rorty’s key phases in his philosophy of religion. During phase one (the 1990s), he was primarily interested in whether, in a democratic society, religion should simply be a private matter or also one of public concern (and if so, then in what way and to what extent). During phase two (post-2000), his thinking on cultural politics developed more broadly, and he wrote about ‘romantic polytheism’ and the future of religion, etc. In his writing from phase one, he portrays himself as a ‘secular humanist’ as well as an atheist and, in his writing from phase two, as a ‘non-theist’ and ‘anti-clericalist’."

The high–status periodical, and education itself, could be seen as motive forces, determining, shaping, announcing and ushering in the ‘Age of Transition’. For the Liberal Catholics ofThe Rambler, the ‘Age of Transition’ could be an ‘Age of Opportunity’, witnessing the start of the reconversion of England; or it could be an ‘Age of Danger’, witnessing the slide of England into overt infidelity. Of the two motive forces, even the most complacent and self-satisfied review writer would admit the greater to be Education."

The philosophy of knowledge concept was used to examine ideas on the nature of mind and reason and on the value, use and limitations of reason, on the grounds that such ideas were the foundation for the reviewers’ speculations on education—one of the most vital of nineteenth century debates. Moreover, the philosophy of knowledge proved to be a useful vehicle for relating the world-view of the periodical writers to their discussions of education at all levels."
10.1017/s0080454100006166,XIII.—Some Disputed Questions in the Philosophy of the Physical Sciences,"More than two thousand years ago the Greek philosophers raised certain questions, which are still undecided, about the origin and character of knowledge regarding the external world. After a period of comparative quiet, the discussion has become very active recently, under the stimulus of the new discoveries in mathematical physics; and, in particular, a lively debate is in progress at the present moment between Sir Arthur Eddington and Dr Harold Jeffreys of Cambridge, Professor Milne of Oxford, Sir James Jeans, and Professor Dingle of the Imperial College, the subject being the respective shares of reason and observation in the discovery of the laws of nature. I propose this afternoon to offer some remarks on the history and present state of this controversy."
10.1017/s0080454100006828,XLII.—The Nature of Scientific Philosophy,"The title I have chosen for this lecture contains an implication which perhaps will not be generally accepted; there was a time when I would not have accepted it myself. The implication is that a particular kind of philosophy is possible which may be called scientific in contrast with other kinds which cannot be so called. I would go further and identify this scientific philosophy with what is generally called science, and this implies that the distinction that is often assumed to exist between science and philosophy is a false one. For this view I believe there is historical evidence. Science, as a separate, self-contained study, dates from the seventeenth century. Before that time, such consideration as was given to the subject-matter of present-day science was given it by philosophers and regarded as a part of their philosophising, and when in the seventeenth century a new kind of procedure was introduced, it was looked upon by its pioneers not as an attack on a new problem but as a new attack on an old problem. The science of that time was the “new philosophy”, faintly adumbrated by some mediæval philosophers, struggling for expression in Francis Bacon, and coming to full recognition in Galileo. Only later, when it had made such progress in certain limited fields of study that a new body of investigators was called into being who confined themselves to those fields, was the new philosophy transformed into a non-philosophy and called generally by the name “science”."

10.1017/s084182090000401x,Legal Positivism and Scottish Common Sense Philosophy,"This paper identifies a volitional theory of meaning common to speech act theory and legal positivism, represented by Hart and Kelsen. This model is compared and contrasted with the model of social operations developed by Reid, a Common Sense Enlightenment philosopher. Whereas the former subscribes to the view that meaning is generated by acts of will, the latter finds meaning to consist of the dual elements of sign and ‘directedness’.
            The ability of positivist theories to provide a structural account of the difference between legal rules and other rules is inextricably linked to this commitment to the volitional theory of meaning. The commitment to the volitional view however leads to problems in requiring that some kind of authority be presupposed in for plain rules to attain legal force. Such authority can only be established with recourse to further rules (thus falling into a malign infinite regress) or must be accepted as a matter of faith. Reid's criterion of direction however vitiates the need for an authority, instead accounting for social communication in general, and rules in particular, in terms of sociological factors. Although no comprehensive critique of the volitional theory is proposed, Reid's model is preferable on the grounds of explanatory richness.
            The core claims of the paper are that: (a) legal positivism necessarily subscribes to the volitional theory of meaning; (b) rejection of the volitional theory necessarily entails rejection of the positivist view that legal and non-legal rules can be differentiated on structural grounds (c) another counter-model exists which avoids some of the pitfalls of the volitional theory; (d) if the volitional theory is rejected then the existence of rules can only be accounted for in a 'strong' sociological sense and legal theory must accordingly accept the dominant role of sociology in conceptualising the nature of rules."

The second part of this paper proposes to think three possible interfaces of the topic of Human Cognitive Enhancement. Firstly the Body-electronic interface such as in the organ-on a chip simulation of an externalized human organ function, secondly the optogenetic and general genetic “editing” interface in which new technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 open up questions for the future of human beings and our self-determination. Third -and more explicitly- the virtual-immersive interface, exemplified by cognitive enhancement by Avatar schizophrenia therapy and uncanny valley effects of digital body doubles will be introduced. The classic rubber-hand illusion had brought new insights into the plasticity of the body- image and the embodiment of the self, by underlining the strong influence of exteroception for the transformation of the bodily self. We will follow these thoughts on Avatar enhancements in schizophrenia therapy and scrutinize as well research ethical issues. Finally a short outlook on the question of two different types of technological detachment in tension in a Philosophy of Human Technology in which Cognitive Enhancement technologies are subjected to two types of technological detachments a) material/somatic substitution and b) detachment as a topos of independence and autonomy is hinted on."

This approach accentuates the practical aspects of wisdom rather than the analytical rationale of the intellect. Emphasis on practical wisdom persistently reinforces a moral foundation that is not differentiated from personal virtue. At the same time, practical wisdom in Confucianism stresses self-cultivation, or the complete transformation of the self, derived from the internal state of the heart/mind (xin)."

However, Chinese philosophy also faces many problems. Shaken by current market economic forces, it now confronts a huge challenge in taking on its mission of raising questions, both theoretical and practical, and responding to them using the methods of philosophy. This article analyzes developments and problems in the three sub-disciplines of philosophy: Marxist philosophy, the history of Chinese philosophy and foreign philosophies. Using this framework, it will purposefully address the great historical responsibility facing Chinese philosophers."
10.1515/yewph-2016-0032,30 Characteristics of Chinese Philosophy and the Chinese National Spirit,"AbstractHumanistic and ethical thought existed in China already in the ancient culture period, and was strongly enhanced during the Spring and Autumn era. Based on this background and foundation, Confucius is ‘a creator of the paradigm’ of Chinese philosophy, and Lao-Tzu is ‘an original metaphysician,’ both establishing the basic tendencies of Chinese philosophy. After that, the philosophies of pre- and post-Qin eras, all continued to develop along their thought. Chinese philosophy has several characteristics, including the unity of nature and man, truth and goodness, cognition and behavior, ontology and cosmology, humanity and natural law, the theory of human nature and values and many others. Its theoretic framework and basic structure aims to enlighten what humans ought to be - a question at the core of Chinese culture, reflecting the national spirit. The Chinese spirit is paradigmatically expressed in two sayings, “as Heaven’s movement is ever vigorous, so must a gentleman ceaselessly strive,” and “as Earth is broad and profound, so must a gentleman be greatly virtuous and lenient.”"

10.21476/pp.2016.2162,Jazz-Philosophy Fusion,"In this paper I describe and provide a justification for the fusion of jazz music and philosophy which I have developed; the justification is provided from the perspectives of both jazz and philosophy. I discuss two of my compositions, based on philosophical ideas presented by Schopenhauer and Derek Parfit respectively; links to sound files are provided. The justification emerging from this discussion is that philosophy produces ‘non-argumentative effects’ which provide suitable material for artistic expression and exploration. These effects – which are often emotional – are under-recognised in philosophy, but they do important philosophical work in demarcating the kinds of truths we want to discover, and in sustaining our search for them. Jazz-Philosophy Fusion can help to increase metaphilosophical self-consciousness about these effects, while also helping to counteract any undue persuasive force they may achieve. Jazz is a particularly suitable medium because it has independently developed a concern with philosophical ideas; because of strong parallels between jazz and philosophy which explain their mutual openness to fusions, and because improvisation very effectively facilitates the direct audience engagement essential to inducing these effects."

10.1017/s0003055400263338,Science and the Philosophy of Science: A Rejoinder to Professors Goldberg and Gregor,"Since both Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Gregor have limited their responses principally to my specific criticisms of the deductive model, it would seem appropriate to emphasize once more the purpose of this criticism. The issue which I wish to raise, using the discussion of the deductive model as a vehicle, goes far beyond the model itself and even the approach to the philosophy of science which it represents. It should be apparent that there may be little chance of resolving the differences that stand between the respondents and myself regarding either the character of the philosophy of science as a discipline of inquiry or its product, but to some extent these differences can be separated from the more general problem of the relationship between social science and the philosophy of science.I suggested that there is a significant intellectual lag or gulf between political science and contemporary work in the philosophy of science. This situation need not, in principle, be viewed as odd or even undesirable since the distance between philosophy and other fields of science is at least as great. What is unique about political science is that, although it has lost touch with philosophy, it has to a large extent derived its conception of science and its notion of the procedural rules of empirical inquiry from a restricted body of literature in the philosophy of science, i.e., traditional logical empiricism."

10.1017/s026352320000700x,Hegel's Political Philosophy in Italy,"The political philosophy of Hegel, in particular his concept of the state, acquired new impulse early in the 1930a. The crisis of the perlimentary system in Italy or rather of its liberal cultural tradition was apparently the reason for it. Yet this return to Hegel also brought about an improved ability of Italian philosophers to face the mushrooming trends of historical materialism, sociology, socialism and, of course, nationalism. They were all legacies of the very end of the past century which became realities to be deal with just afterwards. They demanded a more appropriate hermeneutic than could be provided by the spiritualism of Platonic origin or by the neo-Kantism previously dominant. Quite simply, Hegel came to be the answer of the Italian academia to a period of intense change and crisis in both political and cultural spheres. Hegel supplied a systematic rational framework within which experience could find the deeper understanding that the time seemed to require. Nonetheless his philosophy unified and internationalised the Italian cultural scene. Unification here does not imply a homogeneity of interpretation. Hegel's system had not been thoroughly mastered and so a ‘true’ understanding could not be possible. Single parts of Hegel's philosophy were not read or interpreted in keeping with the whole system, and connection, when realised, coincided more with the belief of the reader than with the intentions of the author."

First, the purpose is to look closely at the connection between the intellectual enterprises of political philosophy and the philosophy of history. Secondly, the purpose is to outline and criticize the connection as seen by Kant and Hegel. Thirdly, the purpose is to draw some preliminary conclusions about the advantages and disadvantages of underpinning a political philosophy with a view of history. In drawing these conclusions I should like to explore my belief that although it may be possible to undertake the philosophy of history with little direct regard for political philosophy contrariwise it would be mistaken, if not foolish, to present a political philosophy without taking into account problems raised by the philosophy of history."
10.1017/s0263523200002925,The Comedy of Hegel and the Trauerspiel of Modern Philosophy,"The general ground for comedy is therefore a world in which man as subject or person has made himself completely master of everything that counts to him otherwise than the essential content of what he wills and accomplishes, a world whose purposes are therefore destroyed because of their unsubstantiality. Nothing can be done, for example, to help a democratic nation where the citizens are self-seeking, quarrelsome, frivolous, bumptious, without faith or knowledge, garrulous, boastful and ineffectual: such a nation destroys itself by its own folly.
            Hegel is keen to distinguish the merely laughable from the comical in the sequel to this passage from page one thousand, one hundred and ninety-nine of the English translation of his Aesthetics. We may laugh at any contrast between subjective caprice and insubstantial action, while vice and evil are not in themselves comic: “There is also the laughter of derision, scorn, despair, etc. On the other hand, the comical as such implies an infinite light-heartedness and confidence felt by someone raised altogether above his own inner contradiction and not bitter or miserable in it at all; this is the bliss and ease of a man who, being sure of himself, can bear the frustrations of his aims and achievements.” (Is this condition of serenity, I wonder, attained by effort or by grace?) In comedy, “the ruling principle is the contingency and caprice of subjective life” whose nullity and self-destructive folly displays the abused actuality of substantial life. The aberration of the passions that rage in the human heart are drawn from “the aberrations of the democracy out of which the old faith and morals have vanished” (as Hegel describes Aristophanes's comedies). While in tragedy the powers which oppose each other as pathos in individuals are hostile, in comedy, “they are revealed directly as inwardly self-dissolving.” Comedy, as much as tragedy, is always divine comedy, “the Divine here in its community, as the substance and aim of human individuality, brought into existence as something concrete, summoned into action and put in movement.”"
10.1017/s0263523200003049,T H Green's Doubts About Hegel's Political Philosophy,"In this paper I look at T H Green's use of Hegel, with specific reference to political philosophy. I try to assess in particular the limits which Green set to his use of Hegel. I begin by considering briefly Green's knowledge of Hegel, and the extent to which Hegel's ideas can be discerned in his writings. Then I discuss a famous passage which is usually cited as expressing a serious reservation about Hegel's view of politics. I conclude that it is by no means clear how Hegelian Green is: and that this is not a question which Green would have thought important.
            Green died suddenly, weeks before his forty-sixth birthday. He left no autobiography to help us trace his intellectual debts, and we have to rely on the evidence of his writings together with the recollections of his friends. Consequently it is impossible to be certain how much of any particular author Green read. Writers on philosophy were not then generally expected to support every statement with references. Green himself seldom appends footnotes which reveal his sources. Furthermore, his friend and first biographer Nettleship tells us, Green
            
               
                  never overcame his native repugnance to wide reading. He liked, as he used to say, to ‘browse’ amongst books, and it was by brooding over the great sayings of philosophers rather than by traversing their systems in detail, that he seemed to get most of his intellectual nourishment. His mind was reflective, not accumulative.

10.1017/s0263523200007862,Religious Philosophy: Hegel's Occasional Perplexity in the Face of the Distinction Between Philosophy and Religion,"Hegel is widely recognized as the preeminent philosopher of the history of philosophy. His Lectures on the History of Philosophy are designed in large measure to answer questions about philosophy's apparent futility by reformulating the presentation of the seemingly pointless succession of forms of philosophy so as to show its organic development (Hegel, 1994, 24). To reveal the proper shape of the history of philosophy, what is extraneous to it had to be omitted. Much that had previously been regarded as philosophy was now to be treated under the heading of religion. The distinction between philosophy and religion, the decision as to what was philosophy and what was religion, took on an importance it had previously lacked. Although subsequent historians of philosophy did not always share Hegel's concern to show the organic development of the history of philosophy, his decisions about what was to be included and what excluded from philosophy proved particularly important in respect of the question of the place subsequently given to Indian philosophy. For this reason Hegel deservedly holds a central place in current discussions about the philosophical canon."
10.1017/s0263523200001816,"Philosophy, Religion, and the End of Hegel","I want to begin with two of Hegel's endings, one well known, the other less so. First, some words from the closing paragraphs of Hegel's Lectures on the History of Philosophy:
            
               
                  A new epoch has arisen in the world. It seems as if the world spirit has succeeded in casting off everything in objective reality which is alien to itself, in order to comprehend itself as absolute spirit: to produce its own objective world from itself and to keep that world serenely in its own power. The struggle of the finite self-consciousness with the absolute self-consciousness, which once appeared as an alien reality, is now coming to an end. The finite self-consciousness has ceased to be finite; and, by the same token, the absolute self-consciousness has achieved the reality which it formerly lacked. The whole of world history and especially the history of philosophy is the representation of this conflict. History now seems to have achieved its goal, when the absolute self-consciousness is no longer something alien; when the spirit is real as spirit. For spirit is this only when it knows itself to be absolute spirit; and this it knows in speculative science (Wissemchaft).

10.1017/s0263523200007412,From the Separateness of Space to the Ideality of Sensation. Thoughts on the Possibilities of Actualizing Hegel's Philosophy of Nature,"Abstract
            The Cartesian concept of nature, which has determined modem thinking until the present time, has become obsolete. It shall be shown that Hegel's objective-idealistic conception of nature discloses, in comparison to that of Descartes, new perspectives for the comprehension of nature and that this, in turn, results in possibilities of actualizing Hegel's philosophy of nature.
            If the argumentation concerning philosophy of nature is intended to catch up with the concrete Being-of-nature and to meet it in its concretion, then this is impossible for the finite spirit in a strictly a priori sense — this is the thesis supported here which is not at all close to Hegel. As the argumentation rather has to consider the conditions of realization concerning the Being-of-nature, too, it is compelled to take up empirical elements — concerning the organism, for instance, system-theoretical aspects, physical and chemical features of the nervous system, etc. With that, on the one hand, empirical-scientific premises are assumed (e.g. the lawlikeness of nature), which on the other hand become (now close to Hegel) possibly able to be founded in the frame of a Hegelian-idealistic conception. In this sense, a double strategy of empirical-scientific concretization and objective-idealistic foundation is followed up, which represents the methodical basic principle of the developed considerations.
            In the course of the undertaking, the main aspects of the whole Hegelian design concerning the philosophy of nature are considered — space and time, mass and motion, force and law of nature, the organism, the problem of evolution, psychic being — as well as Hegel's basic thesis concerning the philosophy of nature, that therein a tendency towards coherence and idealization manifests itself in the sense of a (categorically) gradually rising succession of nature: from the separateness of space to the ideality of sensation. In the sense of the double strategy of concretization and foundation it is shown that on the one hand possibilities of philosophical penetration concerning actual empirical-scientific results are opened, and on the other hand — in tum — a re-interpretation of Hegel's theorem on the basis of physical, evolution-theoretical and system-theoretical argumentation also becomes possible. In this mutual crossing-over and elucidation of empirical and Hegelian argumentation not only do perspectives of a new comprehension of nature become visible, but also, at the same time — as an essential consequence of this methodical principle — thoughts on the possibilities of actualizing Hegel's philosophy of nature."
10.1017/s0263523200007436,Antigone: towards a Hegelian Feminist Philosophy,"To engage with Hegel's philosophy from a feminist perspective is necessarily to be confronted with questions about the politics of reading (specifically the politics of reading canonic philosophical texts). Politics, that is, both in the obvious, traditional ideological sense (since feminism involves an explicit political agenda) and in the less obvious sense of the politics of the relation between reader and text. For some scholars this automatically places feminist readers in the category of a dubious scholarship which rests on a mistaken understanding of the meanings of both politics and truth.
            It seems to me a mistake — and an inexcusable conceit — to say as some now do, that all scholarship is somehow ‘political’ or is itself politics practised by other means. That view demeans both politics and scholarship. Now this is not to say that a scholar's motives must not be political, only that the methods and results of her researches must be judged according to scholarly standards and not political ones. The aim of scholarship is to seek and to tell the truth, as best one can discern it, and not to promote any particular partisan cause. (Ball, 1995: 24)
            Ball here confines the role of politics in the traditional (ideological) sense to the Weberian category of ‘value’, which may motivate and orient scholarship but which cannot provide the criteria according to which scholarly work is carried out or its findings are judged. He dismisses the relevance of the category ‘politics’ to the understanding of the relation between reader and text as such and instead, argues that ‘truth’ is what that relation should be about. Yet, the work of interpretation and reflection in the reading of texts insofar as it involves a process of interaction between reader and text always problematises, I would argue, the distinction between politics and truth upon which Ball's analysis relies. There are various models on offer, both descriptive and prescriptive for what the process of textual interpretation does or should involve. One can contrast the notion of ‘scholarly standards’ as the route to the true meaning of a text with Skinner's new historicism, the virtuous circle of hermeneutics or the destabilising ambitions of deconstruction (Tully, 1988; Bamett, 1998). These approaches elicit very different interpretive results but they also differ in their assumptions about what is or ought to be taken as authoritative for understanding and interpretation and in this sense they are characterised by a politics of the interplay between reader and text. This is a modest claim but one which disrupts the politics/truth distinction even if it doesn't necessarily imply the end of distinguishing between good and bad, valid and invalid understanding/interpretation."
10.1017/s0263523200002056,The Role of Modern Irony in Hegel's Philosophy of Right,"In what follows I shall attempt to explain why Hegel includes an account of modern, or Romantic irony in the Philosophy of Right, even though a discussion of this type of irony might be thought to belong more properly to the realm of aesthetics than to a work which deals with ethical and political issues. I shall identify two main reasons for the inclusion of modern irony in the Philosophy of Right. The first reason is a fairly obvious one, and I shall therefore not spend much time on it. The second reason is, however, far less obvious, since it concerns a problem with modern irony which Hegel does not make explicit in his brief account of modern irony in the Philosophy of Right. I shall nevertheless argue that Hegel elsewhere provides us with the resources that are needed for identifying this problem with modern irony. We shall see that the problem in question is one that serves to undermine the modern ironist's claim to be absolutely free, thus showing the need for an alternative account of freedom, such as Hegel's theory of ethical life (Sittlichkeit), which in the Philosophy of Right directly follows his remarks on modern irony."
10.1017/s0360966900039177,The Kyoto School: Modern Buddhist Philosophy and the Search for a Transcultural Theology,"AbstractThe author argues that the Kyoto school of modern Japanese Buddhist philosophy can contribute much to Christian reflection on the problem of a transcultural theology. Starting with the work of Nishida Kitaro in the early part of this century, the Kyoto school has attempted to express Mahayana Buddhist thought in Western philosophical categories. Articulating his own “logic” based on the Mahayana notions of emptiness and nothingness, Nishida went on to advance a fully developed philosophy of religion which offers a unique interpretation of Christian theism while presenting the Mahayana tradition in a critical and systematic language accessible to a Western readership. Nishida's colleagues in the School include Tanabe Hajime, Nishitani Keiji, Takeuchi Yoshinori, and Abe Masao among others. A review of the literature available in Western languages is offered, as well as a discussion of some of the salient theological problems raised by this Mahayana critique of Christian theism and its contribution to the problem of a transcultural theological standpoint."
10.1017/s0360966900008914,The Contingency of Solidarity: A Pragmatic Critique of Richard Rorty's Philosophy.,"ABSTRACTPragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty articulates a view of the human person that is deeply at odds with a central assertion of Christianity: that human persons are deeply but not finally vulnerable to the conditions of their existence, and thus not wholly contingent beings. Because key elements of a Christian view of the human person, including a sharp appreciation of human vulnerability and the concept of freedom, as well as grounds for an overriding commitment to the well-being of all human persons are at stake, the author stresses the importance of addressing Rorty's pragmatist views. The author's argument is that Rorty's presentation of solidarity as the public response to human contingency fails on pragmatic grounds and she suggests an alternative view of contingency that can account for the creation of solidarity."
10.1017/s0048671x00000199,"The Sophist and The Swarm: Feminism, Platonism and Ancient Philosophy in Achilles Tatius' Leucippe and Clitophon","Achilles Tatius' novelLeucippe and Clitophonis widely recognised by critics as generally ‘philosophical’, even ‘Platonic’, but critics also agree that the meaning of this philosophy and Platonism–whether it is serious or satiric, semantic or aesthetic–is unclear. As a result of this ambivalence, a perplexity confronts the reader who wants to understand the particularlypoliticalphilosophical meaning of Achilles' novel, especially through its depiction of gender norms and hierarchies. The purpose of this article is to revisit the philosophical possibilities of Achilles' novel in view of its various literary and social-historical contexts. To do this, I work through rather than against the perplexity that confronts the reader ofL&amp;amp;C, proposing a relational, reflexive mode of reading that attends to the interplay of Platonism, Stoicism and the social-historical associations that Achilles' mobilisation of each imparts. Such a mode of reading suggests, against numerous critical interpretations, thatL&amp;amp;Cmay actually relate the feminine to the world in a progressive way. In addition, the development of this mode of reading in response toL&amp;amp;Cpotentially undermines, not only the masculinist gender norms that the novel seems to reinforce, but also the very subject-object dualism that underpins mainstream historicist modes of relating to ancient texts as something out there in the walled-off universe of competing textualities that is ‘the past’."

This programme is relevant and appropriate for use as part of the English curriculum in a remote Aboriginal school in Australia: whether the school has a bilingual or bicultural program in place or not, Philosophy for Children is fitting as it makes thinking skills explicit. Basing it on a concept of a community of inquiry is very supportive to people from a non-English speaking background. The programme of Philosophy for Children brings in subjects from all curriculum areas, thus encouraging the recently supported integrated approach, but is particularly useful for language learning and understanding."
10.1017/s1326011100003938,Láhi and Attáldat: The Philosophy of the Gift and Sami Education,"Abstract
            This article explores the Sami philosophy of the gift as a basis for a transformative pedagogical framework. Grounded on the Sami land-based worldview, this philosophy calls for the recognition and reciprocation of gifts, whether gifts of the land, interpersonal gifts or giftedness of an individual. In particular, the article considers two Sami concepts, that of láhi and attáldat and explains how they can serve as a framework for a Sami pedagogy that takes into account the central role of the Sami worldview in contemporary education while simultaneously critically analysing the colonial structures that continue to impact Sami society and education."

10.5296/jsss.v4i1.9706,The Role of Foreign Policy and International Relations in Economic Development Based on the Philosophy of Liberalism,"The national economic growth is one of the most important development indicators that are affected by a variety of factors including the international relations. International relations consist of a series of actions and interactions of the government and non-government an institutions and political processes of the nations. However, international politics refers to the governmental behaviors or their reactions. On the other hand, and foreign policy includes a set of governmental decisions concerning the foreign relations. Liberalism is a comprehensive view that covers the domestic and foreign policies and is the theoretical framework of this study to discuss the economic development. This library study aimed to investigate the role of the international relations in economic development and analyzed a wide range of the theories or discussions. Review of literature showed the role of the international relations in the economic development of the societies. Furthermore, according to the theory of liberalism, all the countries in the world are interdependent and if this kind of interdependence is efficiently managed using a comprehensive framework it may lead to the economic development."
10.1017/s2046167400043871,On the Philosophy of Statistics,"Statistics, generally considered, is a term of very comprehensive import, and is to be understood as having reference to an important collection of facts properly arranged and systematized in the form of numerical tables, for the purpose of conveying such information or data as may best assist in the investigation and discussion of particular subjects of inquiry. The general principles applicable to these investigations are, for the most part, intimately allied with the mathematical theory of probabilities, and constitute the true science of statistics. It will, moreover, be found, on examination, that the same identical principles lie at the foundation of all the physical and inductive sciences so far as they originally and necessarily depend upon experiment and observation."
10.1017/s0362152900009156,Remigian Commentaries on the ‘Consolation of Philosophy’ and Their Sources,"The Consolation of Philosophy may have owed its popularity to its theme of the search for the summum bonum, the eternal verity beyond the vicissitudes of everyday life, a theme particularly appealing in a period of upheaval and danger such as the tenth and eleventh centuries. But it was much more than a work of conventional piety or Christian philosophy. It was essentially a classical work and its collection of verses in different metres, its mythological allusions and Neoplatonic cosmology, as well as its more Christian discussions of fate and free will, made it a key work in the intellectual ferment of the time. But it was a difficult work, requiring a critical apparatus of elucidation and explanation before its riches could be fully appreciated. This apparatus, in the form of glosses and scholia, necessarily had to draw upon a variety of sources."
10.1017/s0362152900003974,Heriger and the Study of Philosophy at Lobbes in the Tenth Century,"In a recent article on the study of Boethian logical works during the Middle Ages, Osmund Lewry discusses the revival of logical studies at the end of the tenth century, focusing on the period after ca. 970 when Abbo of Fleury and Gerbert of Aurillac (later Pope Sylvester II) renewed the teaching and study of dialectical works, and when Notker Labeo translated some logical texts into German. To this small group of tenth-century scholars known to have been concerned with dialectic and philosophy may be added the name of Heriger, schoolmaster and abbot (990–1007) of the Belgian monastery of Lobbes. The present study begins with the identification of quotations by Heriger from dialectical and philosophical works, then discusses Heriger's use of dialectic in theological argumentation, and finally considers the influence of his philosophical teaching at Lobbes. Heriger's interest in dialectic is revealed by quotations in his Vita Remacli from Boethius' In Topica Ciceronis and Apuleius' Peri Hermeneias. These quotations are identified for the first time in the present study. The application of dialectical learning to theological questions, specifically his use of logical principles in his tract De corpore et sanguine domini (PL 139.179–88), indicates that Heriger's quotations from logical texts reflect more than bookish antiquarianism; the study of dialectic was useful to him in theological argumentation. The evidence of Heriger's philosophical pursuits provides the first clear indication that Lobbes was one of the important Lotharingian centers for philosophical studies."
10.1017/s0362152900004281,The Anonymous Peterhouse Master and the Natural Philosophy of Plants,"Early in the thirteenth century, probably within the first decade, a treatise on plants was translated from the Arabic by Alfred of Sareshel (or Alveredus Anglicus), which was to become the foundation of the science of botany for the Latin-speaking world. This treatise was until the sixteenth century universally ascribed to Aristotle and awarded all the authority accorded the Philosopher in the other sciences. Within a generation of the appearance of the Latin version the De plantis had become a set text in university curricula and by 1254 was prescribed by statute at the University of Paris as an examination subject. Roger Bacon was lecturing on the text at Paris already in the 1240s and a decade later Albert the Great was composing his monumental and never-to-be-surpassed commentary on the same text."
10.1017/s0362152900013234,A Sermon in Praise of Philosophy,"Worcester Cathedral MS F.10 forms a random collection of Latin, English, and macaronic sermons which were gathered and copied by a fairly large number of scribes in the middle of the fifteenth century. These sermons, most of them anonymous, are for a variety of occasions and audiences and have been entered in no particular liturgical order, even if, as the presence of several sets of quire numbers indicates, the individual quires were reordered several times in the medieval period. The collection contains a number of pieces that were evidently preached to a university audience, as is shown by their addressing “magistri” and by internal references to a university milieu. Their locale was presumably Oxford. Besides such general university sermons, the collection also includes two that are labeled “Introitus Sententiarum” and three other pieces that agree with these in form — the scholastic sermon structure — and content — praise of theology or holy Scripture and Peter Lombard. These five pieces are introitus, academic speeches or sermons which, according to university statutes, bachelors as well as masters (or doctors) of theology were required to deliver as they began their courses on the Bible or on Peter Lombard's Sentences. In addition, the manuscript contains an item that is very similar to the introitus sermons in that it follows the scholastic sermon structure and praises its subject. The latter, however, is not theology but philosophy, and the thema on which the piece is based is not a biblical text but a quotation from Aristotle. A sermon on a secular text itself is a rarity in medieval sermon literature, certainly from England; and appearing as it does in a sermon collection, the piece seems to be a rarissima avis stuck in the wrong flock."
10.1017/s036215290000252x,Philosophy as Handmaid of Theology: Biblical Exegesis in the Service of Scholarship,"“One can only grant the theological faculty the arrogant claim that the philosophical faculty is its maidservant (leaving aside the question of whether the latter bears the torch before, or carries the train after her mistress) on the condition that she is not banished or gagged.” Thus wrote Immanuel Kant, paraphrasing Peter Damian, in his Der Streit der Fakultäten of 1798, shortly after being freed from a ban on writing about religion. Kant argued that the role of the philosophy faculty in universities was to lay down the truth for the use of the more practically orientated higher faculties, including that of theology. It could only perform this function if it was totally free."
10.1017/s0362152900001318,Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy and the Greco-Roman Consolatory Tradition,"The scholarship on the literary genre of Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy (henceforth Consolatio) proposes a surprising interpretation: the Consolatio is not a consolation in spite of its title and overt goal. Typically, scholars of the consolatory genre simply note that the Consolatio should not be considered together with ancient and medieval consolations. Scholars of the Consolatio, however, offer specific reasons as to why Boethius's text is not a consolation. One is stylistic: some interpreters (Curley, Dronke, Marenbon, Pabst, Payne, Relihan) argue that the prosimetric style in which the Consolatio is written is typical of a “Menippean satire” and does not befit a consolation. The content of the Consolatio is also considered to be at odds with the consolatory genre: Boethius's text is interpreted as promising a consolation that either is not delivered (Payne, Relihan) or is only partially achieved (Marenbon). Finally, some scholars (O'Daly, Gruber, Rand, Reiss, Shanzer) hold that because the Consolatio presents features that are typical of several literary genres (i.e., Menippean satire, philosophical dialogue, exhortation to philosophy, etc.) it is impossible to classify Boethius's last work as belonging exclusively to one genre or another — the text should, thus, be regarded as an “eclectic” work."
10.1017/s0362152900001665,William of Auvergne on the Dangers of Paradise: Biblical Exegesis between Natural Philosophy and Anti-Islamic Polemic,"The Earthly Paradise was a favorite topic of medieval theologians, philosophers, poets, and artists. Drawn as much from the biblical paradisus voluptatis (Gen. 2:8–14) and hortus conclusus (Song of Sol. 4:12) as from Greek and Roman accounts of a locus amoenus, the general outlines of paradise were well established by the patristic period: it is a garden or garden-like natural place, on Earth but set aside by God, perfect in every attribute, wholly uncorrupted, temperate in its climate, gently watered by rivers and fountains, ever fertile in its soil, rich in fruits and beasts of every kind; its inhabitants do not experience exertion, passion, illness, pain, or shame; in short, it is a place free of the consequences of sin. These attributes were frequently applied to both the Garden of Eden enjoyed by the first parents and the Heaven enjoyed by the blessed after death, so “paradise” could be understood in both terrestrial and celestial forms, overlapping spiritually and materially."
10.1017/s0362152900012423,Poliziano and Philosophy: The Birth of the Modern Notion of the Humanities?,"This article is focused on Angelo Poliziano's general attitude to philosophy as a discipline and on his specific accounts of scholastic philosophy, found mainly in his four opening lectures to his courses on Aristotle's logic and ethics that were held in the Florentine Studium between 1490 and 1494, in the light of his overall exclusive classical approach. It shows, among other things, that philosophy was more important to Poliziano than common expressions such as “the humanist interest in philosophy” may suggest. Poliziano's important definition of history presented in his Panepistemon, together with other pieces of evidence, can reveal the moment in which disciplines associated with the “humanities” (in the modern sense of this term) began to be separated from the natural sciences — at a point just preceding the massive critique of Aristotelian science during the sixteenth century — through Poliziano's notion of a philosophical literature to which also the Aristotelian texts belong."
10.21013/jems.v4.n2.p1,A Thing-Oriented Perspective of Ancient Indian Philosophy,"&lt;em&gt;With the emergence of thing-oriented doctrines in the recent times, there is a gradual shift of attention from human subjects to material objects in the contemporary educational realm. Thing theory and object-oriented ontology, as thing-oriented doctrines, are in equilibrium with their primary concern with things.  Both of them are pertinent to each other in multifarious ways. While thing theory is concerned with the significance of things in relation to literature and culture, object-oriented ontology focuses on the centrality of things in philosophy. The study made by thing-oriented scholars divulges that the worth of corporeal things has been overlooked by humans down the ages. However, there are a few instances here and there wherein things were said to gain some attention. This research paper seeks to make a study of how things were understood in the schools of ancient Indian philosophy, and it looks at the views of those schools on things from a thing-oriented perspective. It explores the general philosophy of the Upanishads concerning the reality of things in the world. It also attempts to identify and elucidate the constructive views on things which could be traced in the doctrines of the philosophical schools of the Nyāya, the Vaisheshika, the Sāṃkhya, the Mīmāṃsā and the Cārvāka. These schools’ realist approach to things is contrasted with the monistic idealism of the schools of the Advaita Vedānta and the Yoga.  The paper also examines how things are undermined and overmined in ancient Indian philosophy. &lt;/em&gt;"
10.21500/22563202.2308,"Darśana, Philosophy and Religion in Pre-modern India","&lt;p&gt;The Sanskrit word, &lt;em&gt;darśana&lt;/em&gt;, is generally translated into English as philosophy, but it is admittedly inadequate. The so-called six (&lt;em&gt;āstika, &lt;/em&gt;affirmativist or orthodox) systems of philosophy have been described by Louis Renou as ‘philosophico-religious,’ since religion and philosophy cannot be separated in their tradition. On the other hand, Maurice Winternitz brands some of the six (such as Mīmāṃsā and Vedānta) as religion and some others (such as, Nyāya and Vaiśeṣika) as philosophy. A.K. Warder claims that, despite everything, religion and philosophy can be separated quite adequately, and the &lt;em&gt;darśana&lt;/em&gt;s are all philosophies. All this however leaves the so-called six (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;āstika&lt;/em&gt;, negativist or heterodox) systems, particularly the materialist systems out of consideration. While the Jain and the Buddhist systems do have religious associations, the pre-Cārvāka and the Cārvāka materialist systems remained thoroughly philosophical, untouched by any religion. The orthodox systems, mostly in their syncretic forms, became religio-philosophical (although some of them might have originated as philosophy) while the materialist systems retained their original secular character. &lt;/p&gt;"
10.1515/kantyb.2013.5.1.127,"Kant’s Cognitive Semantics, Newton’s Rule 4 of Experimental Philosophy and Scientific Realism Today","AbstractKant’s Critique of Pure Reason contains an original and powerful semantics of singular, specifically cognitive reference which has important implications for epistemology and for philosophy of science (and which is entirely independent of Transcendental Idealism). Here I argue that Kant’s cognitive semantics directly and strongly supports Newton’s Rule 4 of Experimental Philosophy in ways which support Newton’s realism about gravitational force. I begin with Newton’s Rule 4 and its role in Newton’s justification of realism about gravitational force (§ 1). I then briefly summarize Kant’s semantics of singular cognitive reference (§ 2), and show that it is embedded in, and strongly supports, Newton’s Rule 4, and that it rules out not only Cartesian physics (per Harper) but also Cartesian, infallibilist presumptions about empirical justification generally (§ 3). This result exposes a key fallacy in Bas van Fraassen’s main argument for his anti-realist Constructive Empiricism, and in many common objections to realism (§ 4). These problems reveal yet a further important regard in which Constructive Empiricism is not (so to speak) ‘empirically’ adequate, not even to Classical Newtonian Mechanics (§ 5). This inadequacy of Constructive Empiricism highlights a chronic empiricist misunderstanding of Newton’s mechanics (§ 6). Finally, Kant’s cognitive semantics improves upon the semantic interpretation of scientific theories, and rectifies the presumption that laws of physics literally ‘lie’ (§ 7). Thus Kant and Newton still have invaluable lessons for contemporary philosophy and history of science (§ 8)."

Accordingly, the present study sought to illuminate the practical ways through which PBLT could be utilized to put Applied ELT into practice. In so doing, the key is to redefine the inherent roles of both English learners and practitioners in an Applied ELT classroom. Bringing a bulk of sample philosophical questions, the paper provides the following recommendations to implement PBLT in Applied ELT classes. First, ELT life syllabus can be designed using the principles of PBLT approach. Second, while dealing with language skills, material designers might reshape the common pre and post task activities including life-related philosophical questions. Moreover, as males and females have different points of view towards life issues, materials should provide a platform to augment learners' thoughts through sharing ideas of both genders in the classroom in answering philosophical questions. Third, along with cross-cultural approaches, PBLT can aid life syllabus design which assists learners to consider themselves as an active member of local and global communities all around the world."
10.18784/analisa.v2i01.454,THE PHILOSOPHY OF OCEANIC VERSES OF THE QUR’AN AND ITS RELEVANCE TO INDONESIAN CONTEXT,"The Qur’an is not merely a transcendental or spiritual Holy Scripture, but it also establishes itself as the full assurance and un-doubtful scripture that gives guidance and its explanation thereof. Oceanic versesare certain selected ayats or verses of the Qur’an that contain words of ‘ocean’ and ‘sea’ in several terms such as bahr, bahri, bahru, bihar, bahrayn, bahran, abhur, and bahiratun. These verses have been examined in classical and contemporary studies by putting together earlier exegeses with modern scientific records and field observations but not in terms of established theories, nor through socio-economic paralellistic approach. This paper focuses on the semantics and ontology of oceanic verses and paralellistic approach as they were revealed and found in 42 verses in the Qur’an. Keywords in those verses were studied to enable us to build and lead us to practical benefit in science, technology and methodology. The interpretation of Qur’anic verses pertaining to ocean phenomena offers an alternative interpretation on several relevant issues, including fire/energy within ocean; two oceans that do not mingle; the darkness of the ocean deep; the ocean boundaries; the layers of the ocean; and the abundance wealth and benefits from ocean for mankind. Indonesia is blessed with the ability to combine the Qur’an containing plenty of oceanic guidance and its geographical position as the most strategic archipelago on earth. Cascading the oceanic verses into daily da’wah and weekly Friday sermon is a necessary means to reap the ontological benefits of the blessing Qur’an and of dwelling in the largest marine continent of Indonesia."
10.1017/s0034670517000754,The Origins of “Social Justice” in the Natural Law Philosophy of Antonio Rosmini,"Abstract
            “Social justice” is a powerful idea today, but its origins and meaning are unclear. One of the first to use the term was Antonio Rosmini, author of The Constitution under Social Justice (1848) and other works of moral philosophy. I argue that Rosmini arrived at his idea of social justice by developing Thomistic natural law theory into a novel view of the common good that balances two principles: (1) the equal rights and dignity of persons as ends-in-themselves, a version of “personalism” influenced by Kant and Christianity; and (2) unequal rewards for those who contribute most to society, a version of Aristotelian “proportionalism” based on the social nature of man. I conclude by comparing Rosmini's idea of social justice to John Rawls's “theory of justice” and Catholic social teaching."

It is apt and timely, therefore, as its likely dissolution approaches, to provide a brief account of its origins and development up to and including the period of its entry into London University under the leadership of the most famous modern historian of philosophy Frederick Copleston. Following on from this, the idea of a distinctive Jesuit intellectual tradition, and more specifically of the Jesuit contribution to philosophy, is explored."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190226992.013.1,Algorithmic Music and the Philosophy of Time,"What is time? This question has captivated philosophy again and again. The present chapter investigates how far algorithms involve temporality in a specific form, and why algorithmic music is a distinctive way of understanding time. Its orienting undercurrent is the idea that temporality, by its very nature, gives rise to conflictual perspectives that resist the attempt to be rendered in terms of a unified presence. These perspectives are coordinates of a tension field in which the algorithmic is necessarily embedded and invested, and which unfolds in algorithmic music. Drawing from a selection of examples and sources, the chapter leads through a series of such contradictions and touches upon a few interesting theories of time that have sprung from philosophy, music, and computer science, so as to actualize their mutual import."
10.29107/rr2017.1.1,Rhetoric as Philosophy of Language. An Aristotelian Perspective,"This paper sustains that rhetoric can be a fruitful way of practicing philosophy of language. The startingpoint is a suggestion drawn from the work of the Italian philosopher Roberto Esposito. According toEsposito, one of the main characteristics of the Italian thought is the focus on the necessary connectionbetween language and extra-linguistic world. I argue that rhetoric (intended in an Aristotelian sense), thanks to its extra-linguistic aim (persuasion), pays particular attention to this connection. This has important consequences: 1. considering speakers and listeners as essential components of speech and assigning a key position to the listener; 2. including the sphere of emotion in the fi eld of refl ection on language; 3. considering truth as a social practice; 4. considering the agonistic dimension as a constitutive element of the speech."

Through these cases a stark divergence between the legal and philosophical discussion of alternative possibilities is highlighted. The paper seeks to vindicate the legal approach to coercion and volition by showing that the legal approach could be accounted for with an epistemic version of the Principle of Alternative Possibilities, a version which is also immune to Frankfurt-type examples."

This picture of analytic philosophy shapes this collection’s focus on the history of the philosophy of mathematics, physics, and psychology. The following essays uncover, reflect on, and exemplify modes of philosophy that are engaged with these allied disciplines. They make the case that, to the extent that analytic philosophers are still concerned with philosophy’s ties to these disciplines, we would do well to pay attention to neo-Kantian views on those ties."

10.4102/sajce.v1i2.89,Philosophy for children in South African schools: its role for citizens-in-waiting,"Historically, the concept ‘child’ has a Lockean (1960)connotation, as empty slates new born infants, are considered weak and helpless, until the improvement of growth and age has removed this deficient state of childhood. In modern societies, including South Africa, children are still viewed as citizens-in-waiting, and as citizens who need to be inducted into their future role. This deficit model of childhood is reflected in the construction of democratic citizenship education in post-apartheid South Africa. In this article we present a theoretical justification for Philosophy for Children (P4C) as an avenue to individual enlightenment i.e., education that entails the development of a child’s mind, of rationality or the capacity to think. In the light of a Philosophy for Children agenda as an educational pedagogy, we argue that doing philosophy with children starting from an early age has a special significance in education for democratic citizenship in post-apartheid South Africa."

It examines the influence of the technology of writing, as well as of natural-scientific inquiry, especially in the domain of health and medicine, and the transregional importance of literacy and science for the project of philosophy, while also showing that Indian philosophy functions throughout the classical and into the modern period as a relatively discrete intellectual activity. Finally it shows, by comparing the French materialist philosopher Pierre Gassendi with Indian philosophers in the mid-1660s, how differences in the two philosophical traditions’ relationships to literacy and science continued to play a role in the perception of a philosophical divide between these two traditions."
10.1093/oso/9780190460723.003.0002,The Impact of Social Neuroscience on Moral Philosophy,"Part I begins with Patricia Churchland exploring the impact of social neuroscience on moral philosophy. She argues that the basic platform for morality is attachment and bonding, and the caring behavior motivated by such attachment—and that oxytocin, a neurohormone, is at the hub of attachment behavior in social mammals and probably birds. Not acting alone, oxytocin works with other hormones and neurotransmitters and circuitry adaptations. Among its many roles, oxytocin decreases the stress response, making possible the trusting and cooperative interactions typical of life in social mammals. Churchland also argues that learning local social practices depends on the reward system because in social animals approval brings pleasure and disapproval brings pain. Subcortical structures, she argues, are the key to acquiring social values, and quite a lot is known about how the reward system works. Acquiring social skills also involves generalizing from samples, so that learned exemplars can be applied to new circumstances."

They did not thereby challenge Jewish tradition as much as show its rational depth and truth.

Our best understanding of divine wisdom and the commandments—and thus, our best prospect for striving to be holy—involves the exercise of reason. Revelation is a source of rational wisdom. Although the holiness attainable by human beings is not purely or exclusively intellectual, it depends on an appreciation of divine holiness through the understanding."

Some of the contributions address interpretive issues within Dennett’s corpus, and they aim to bring increased clarity to Dennett’s project. Others report novel empirical data, at least in part, in the service of fleshing out Dennett’s claims. Some of them provide a fresh take on a Dennettian theme, and others extend his views in novel directions. Like Dennett’s own work, these papers draw on a wide range of different methodologies, from appeals to intuition pumps and scientific data, to turning the knobs on a theory to see what it can do. But each of them aims to be readable, and approachable. And as a whole, the volume provides a critical and constructive overview of Dennett’s stance-based methodology, as well as explorations of his claims about metal representation, consciousness, cultural evolution, and religion."

&#x0D;
&#x0D;
Peter Anstey’s book John Locke on Natural Philosophy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011) (henceforth JLNP), presented an interpretation of Locke’s work on science and medicine, and how this shaped his philosophical views. It was wide-ranging in scope and often impressively detailed. It raised a number of questions about Locke’s relationship to the work of J. B. van Helmont, his collaboration with Thomas Sydenham, and the overall chronology and trajectory of his natural philosophical interests. It also occasioned a number of questions about methodology in the history of philosophy and how we should construct an interpretation of a thinker like Locke from the published, manuscript and historical records available. Some of these questions were posed explicitly in a ‘Review Article’ in these pages.&#x0D;

At the same time, we have sought the influences on his work from Aristotelian thought. In this direction, we show that the American philosopher considered the philosophy of pragmatism as applicable to a democratic education, which is also considered to be moral education.&lt;/p&gt;"

Considering how ‘religion’ should be defined, and whether we even need to be able to define it in order to engage in the philosophy of religion, it goes on to discuss whether the existence of God matters. Exploring the problem of evil, this VSI debates the connection between faith and reason, and the related question of what role reason should play in religious contexts. Shedding light on the relationship between science and religion, it finishes by considering the topics of reincarnation and the afterlife."

Some of these questions concern religion generally; others concern particular families of religion; and some concern particular religious traditions. ‘What is the philosophy of religion?’ explains how there is an intimate relationship between philosophy of religion and theology, but that the nature and location of the border between them is of some dispute. Some religions, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism, embrace philosophical reflection, whereas the Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—contain very little in the way of explicit philosophical reflection. Despite this, numerous Abrahamic philosophers have made important contributions to the philosophy of religion."

This premise was stated by John Stuart Mill more than 170 years ago, and Mill's canon, the Method of Agreement, is used here as a basis to create the ""Common Cause"" (CC) research design. The CC design is particularly relevant when a set of multiple circumstances can be represented by alternative theories of change or competing explanations. We consider several potential applications of the design and elaborate its structure within the validity framework of Shadish, Cook, and Campbell. We discuss threats to validity controlled by the CC design (e.g., selection bias, the bane of applied researchers, is not relevant) and illustrate possible analytic strategies using simulated data. We explicitly compare the CC design to four quasi-experimental designs in terms of the validity threats that they eliminate. Design weaknesses are addressed and ways to enhance the design's inferential power discussed. The CC design itself represents a proof of concept suggesting that other research designs can be created from philosophical principles."

In this study a review of the today’sstatus of the biological research in all the countries is undertaken in order to present the possible reasons of the existing gap,hoping to reveal the proper solutions for the desirable improvement.

10.1017/s0368315x00001213,8. Retrospect of Mental Philosophy (Periodical Literature.),"The first number for the year is not remarkable for any paper of striking value. Readers of the Journal will be chiefly attracted by the long and clearly written resumé of Dr. Hughlings Jackson's recent studies “On Affections of Speech from Disease of the Brain,” which is contributed by Mr. James Sully. He remarks on the great value of Dr. Jackson's attempts to classify the different forms of aphasia under the three main heads or stages of—(1) Defect of Speech, in which the patient has a full vocabulary, but confuses words; (2) Loss of Speech, in which the patient is practically speechless, and his pantomimic power is impaired as well; and (3) Loss of Language, in which, besides being speechless, he has altogether lost the power of pantomime, and even his faculty of emotional language is deeply involved in the wreck. All these states or stages again are, properly speaking, to be distinguished altogether from affections of speech in the way of loss of articulation (owing to paralysis of the tongue, &amp;amp;c.), or loss of vocalisation (owing to disease of the larynx); whereas the three degrees or stages of aphasia proper are due to a deep-seated and severe disorganisation of the brain. The main interest of the theory lies in the ingenious and carefully-argued analysis of the symptoms, by which Dr. Jackson arrives at the theory that as the process of destruction goes on, the superior “layers” or strata of speech fail first—those namely which involve the ordinary power of adapting sounds to the circumstances of the moment as they arise; after them fail the “more highly organized utterances” those, namely, which have in any way become automatic, such as “come on,” “wo! wo!” and even “yes” and “no,” which stand on the border-line between emotional and intellectual language; next fails the power of adapting other than vocal signs to convey an intended meaning, which is called, rather clumsily, “pantomimic propositionising;” and last of all dies out the power of uttering sounds or making signs expressive merely of emotion—a power which, of course, is not true speech at all."

Retrospect of Mental Philosophy (Periodical Literature.): Psychology No. II,"Our English philosophical quarterly amply maintains its interest, although the number of papers devoted to our more special subject is not great. The April number contains a sketch by Prof. Groom Robertson, the Editor, of the contents of Prof. Goltz's third Memoir on brain-localisations, in opposition to the recent work of Hitzig and Ferrier. The main point of Prof. Goltz's criticism, which will not be unknown to most of our readers, is the insistence upon a distinction between permanent and temporary effects of a destruction of portions of the cerebrum. He has found, after most extensive washing-out of the grey matter of the cortex, that neither total loss of touch, sight, smell, &amp;amp;c., nor permanent paralysis of any muscle followed. And his conclusion from these and various corroborating experiments is, that any part of the cortex seems to be a possible organ of voluntary motions, and that, if all its parts are not perfectly equivalent and adaptable inter se, they are at least so far able to take up the functions of any parts destroyed as to negative the theory of circumscribed cortical centres. The whole criticism, of course, is only a stage in the development of the theory of brain functions, upon which no one imagines that the last word has by any means been yet said."

The Athenians' love of the noble has given way to a voracious love of gold. With artists looking upon their work as merchandise to be sold at the highest price, the only thing considered beautiful is a line of salacious chorus-girls. Flattery and utility prevail throughout. The lowest form of friendship is thought to be the highest. Athens has disintegrated as a community of citizens sharing a common heritage. And philosophy, no longer a speculative inquiry, has become a shameless way of life, based on a fixed doctrine and virtually indistinguishable from misanthropy."

10.17507/jltr.0902.19,On Linguistic Philosophy of Mikhail Bakhtin and Hallidayan Systemic Functional Linguistics,"It is noteworthy that florid descriptions of interaction between linguistics and the philosophy of language are regularly inspired. In this paper, parallels have been drawn between Bakhtin’s philosophical perspectives and Hallidayan theoretical claims of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). Through the analysis of Bakhtin’s theory of dialogism, heteroglossia, chronotope and metalinguistics, I argue that Hallidayan Systemic Functional Linguistic theory is compatible with Bakhtin’s philosophical perspectives to a great extent in terms of the close relations between speech genre and register, heteroglossia and appraisal theory as well as metalinguistics and metafunctions. It is safe to say that as a precursor, Bakhtin has a profound influence on socio-semioticians like Halliday who has expounded in linguistics."

10.24204/ejpr.v10i1.1873,Philosophy of Religion as Way to Skepticism,"The article aims to answer the question whether philosophy of religion can fulfil its research goals, that is discover the essence of religion, find out if any one of them (and, if need be, which one) is true and if faith and religious behavior are rational. In the face of a multitude of religions it is difficult to point to any common elements which makes it harder (if not impossible) to discover the essence of religion. Trying to prove the consistency of the concept of God as an object of religion and either His/Her existence or non-existence faces similar problems; this makes it impossible to conclusively decide whether religion is true or not. Therefore, it is also difficult to settle whether religious faith (or lack thereof) is rational or irrational. However, this failure does not deny the cognitive value of philosophy of religion, which can analyze various religious doctrines as it relates to their consistency, truthfulness, or the rationality of following them.  "

In order to lay the foundations of a different economy, one that is not based on wage labor and the exploitation of human life and nature based on their auto-alienation, but rather on action in accordance with their resources, we need – according the author – to rethink the concept of the state in a non-philosophical and post-capitalist fashion, structurally different from the modern bourgeois state.

10.25180/lj.v19i2.97,"From the Philosophy of Theatre to Performance Philosophy: Laruelle, Badiou and the Equality of Thought","Abstract This article draws from François Laruelle's non-standard philosophy to locate gestures of philosophical ""authority"" or 'sufficiency"" within recent work in the philosophy of theatre – including material from contemporary Anglo-American philosophical aesthetics, and texts by Alain Badiou, such as In Praise of Theatre (2015). Whilst Badiou initially appears magnanimous in relation to theatre's own thinking - famously describing theatre as ""an event of thought"" that ""directly produces ideas"" (Badiou 2005: 72) - I argue that this very benevolence, from a Laruellean perspective, constitutes another form of philosophical authoritarianism. In contrast, I indicate some affinities between Laruelle's non-standard aesthetics and the emerging field of Performance Philosophy - one aim of which, as distinct from the philosophy of theatre, would be to allow performance to qualitatively extend our concepts of thinking and/or to be attentive to the ways in which performance has already provided new forms of philosophy. "
10.1017/s0017383518000062,Philosophy,"Sarah Broadie writes on ‘The Knowledge Unacknowledged in the Theaetetus’ for Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy. Her paper makes two main claims: first, that Plato in the Theaetetus rejects the ‘additive’ picture for knowledge, namely, that knowledge is true judgement with something else (e.g. an account); and second, that in the Theaetetus true judgement relies on prior knowledge, especially if that knowledge is arrived at methodically. Thus, true judgement is not necessary for knowledge and sometimes knowledge is necessary for true judgement. Broadie's argument, roughly, is that, in the Theaetetus, true judgement is already a high-level epistemic achievement. She has a number of pieces of evidence for this. The first is Theaetetus 189e4–190a6, where Socrates stresses that a judgement is an assertion that results from a soul having a silent, internal debate. Broadie infers from this that a judgement involves reasons even if those reasons are not good reasons; judgement, for Plato, is more than a mere doxastic attitude (95–6). This already looks unfriendly to the additive picture. Once I have a judgement I have reasons, and when I have a true judgement, I have good reasons. If I have good reasons then what I have is reliable and secure. So, what more could I add to upgrade this cognitive achievement to make it knowledge? Broadie goes on to explore the alternative to the additive picture given in the Sophist and the Statesman. There it turns out that there may be topics that simply cannot be captured by the additive picture: cases where there must be knowledge of an object in the absence of true judgements about that object. This is Broadie's knowledge unacknowledged."

10.1017/s1358246116000060,The Open Museum and its Enemies: An Essay in the Philosophy of Museums,"AbstractBorrowing from the title and some of the content of Karl Popper'sThe Open Society and its Enemies(1945), it is argued that museums have great value as sites for what may be called a philosophical culture. A philosophical culture is one in which members or citizens engage in (ideally) fair-minded debate and shared reflection, presenting and evaluating reasons for different positions particularly as these have relevance for matters of governance. In a philosophical culture, persuasion is almost always a matter of seeking to provide reasonable grounds for adopting some position without resorting to violence or physical force (though, of course, force may be necessary to constrain those who themselves resort to violence).A philosophical culture is, in turn, an important foundation for a democratic culture and republic. A philosophy of museums emerges, a model we shall call the Philosophical Culture Museum Model. This concept is stipulative and ideal in the sense that it presents a paradigm of a museum with great virtue and promise. It must be confessed, however, that, historically, this is an emerging concept of the role of museums and one not evident in many of the museums in the early modern era or today. Reasons are offered as to why the time may be right to recognize the philosophy of museums as a particular sub-field in the overall practice of philosophy."
10.1017/s1358246116000096,‘A Sudden Surprise of the Soul’: Wonder in Museums and Early Modern Philosophy,"AbstractRecent museum practice has seen a return to ‘wonder’ as a governing principle for display and visitor engagement. Wonder has long been a contentious topic in aesthetics, literary studies, and philosophy of religion, but its adoption in the museum world has been predominantly uncritical. Here I will suggest that museums draw on a concept of wonder that is largely unchanged from seventeenth-century philosophy, yet without taking account of early modern doubts about wonder's efficacy for knowledge. In this paper I look at Descartes' and Spinoza's views about wonder and the uses and disadvantages of wonder as a learning tool. This examination is extended to consider Descartes' and Spinoza's likely views about ‘museums’, in the sense of spaces that link objects both to feeling and to knowing. Finally, I suggest that there are resources in Spinoza's philosophy for bringing knowledge-enhancing feelings into the museum without resorting to the problematic concept of wonder."

Lewis, who was responsible for the revival of modal logic in the era of modern symbolic logic, characterized ‘intensional’ approaches to logic as typical of post-Leibnizian ‘continental philosophy’, in contrast to the ‘extensionalist’ approaches dominant in the British tradition. Indeed Lewis’s own work in this area had been inspired by the logic of his teacher, the American ‘Absolute Idealist’, Josiah Royce. Hegel’s ‘Subjective Logic’ in Book III of his Science of Logic, can, I suggest, be considered as an intensional modal logic, and this paper explores parallels between it and a later variety of modal logic—tense logic, as developed by Arthur Prior in the 1950s and 60s. Like Lewis, Prior too had been influenced in this area by a teacher with strong Hegelian leanings—John N. Findlay. Treated as an intensional (with an ‘s’) logic, Hegel’s subjective logic can be used as a framework for addressing issues of intentionality (with a ‘t’)—the mind’s capacity to be intentionally directed to objects. In this way, I suggest that the structures of his subjective logic can clarify what is at issue in the ‘Psychology’ section of the Encyclopaedia Philosophy of Subjective Spirit."
10.1515/humaff-2016-0038,The possibility of applying Whitehead’s philosophy,"AbstractIn this paper I try to elucidate the differences between theoretical and practical endeavors in philosophy, and then to show that in a sense philosophy has to be theoretical, but— if it claims to be viable—it must be practical as well. First I consider the meaning of the terms theoretical, practical, abstract, and concrete. Then, with the help of Whitehead’s ideas on this topic, I briefly reflect on the method, aims and role of philosophy. I hold that a properly established philosophical approach should have its roots in concrete experience and should include concrete applications. Thus, abstract ideas can be (and indeed often are) transformed into our daily life practices, being applied to solve real problems—personal, social, environmental, etc. The ideas are conveyed from the sphere of philosophy to that of ordinary life. In the next stage I demonstrate this principle using a concrete example, Whitehead’s philosophical system and how it can be fruitfully applied to the sphere of deep ecology. There are many other examples that could be mentioned, but giving a proper demonstration of this application principle requires more space and so I concentrate only on one of these examples."

As access to the Internet grows, so does the richness of resources the Internet can supply. With the changes in health care brought by communication, telematics will become the successor to informatics. The authors present the philosophy of telematics training and propose a short training course designed to help health professionals in developing nations take advantage of telematics, providing conceptual understanding and hands-on training."

This paper addresses the integration of health and informatics education, or health education and informatics education, or informatics education in health care delivery. It gives an introduction to the status of a health informatics programme in the daily practice of computer use. The essence of a health informatics curriculum, the planning and administration of the programme in medical schools, and what informatics education offers the health sector, even in a developing country, are presented. The problems of administering an informatics programme in a conventional medical training curriculum are highlighted. The article describes the philosophy which should underline the framework for the formulation of appropriate national policies and curricula for health informatics education in developing countries, using Nigeria as a case study."
10.12697/aa.2017.4.03,Kas aeg on liigestest lahti? Uuemad arutelud aja üle ajaloos ja ajaloofilosoofias [Abstract: Is time out of joint? Recent discussions on time in history and the philosophy of history],"The core aim of this article is to provide an overview of the recent contemporary interest in temporality in the humanities by scrutinizing the thesis that during the last few decades, the modern understanding of time, and in particular the idea of the distinctiveness of the categories of past, present, and future, is no longer feasible and thus requires reconsideration. Authors of the new paradigm claim that instead of a past that is separate from the present, we now are increasingly facing a past that has become a significant part of the present. With respect to the future, it is often claimed that instead of seeing our future as a bright horizon of improvement and progress, we are now confronting a future that appears as a threat and a menace. On closer examination, the discussion on temporality concerns transformations of Western cultural and political life more generally, as well as the foundations of academic disciplines working on matters of the past. Interestingly, recent trends in the philosophy of history also testify to growing interest in issues regarding time, particularly the relationship between past and present.        &#x0D;
The paper consists of four parts. The first part sheds light on the diverse terminology that different authors such as Reinhart Koselleck, François Hartog, Aleida Assmann, and Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht employ in examining temporality. It also illustrates the broad scope of empirical material that such research can be based upon. The second part focuses on explaining the core premises of the modernist idea of time by drawing primarily on Reinhart Koselleck, who has famously argued that the modern developmental vision of history, which according to him sustains both the discourse of progress and modern historical thinking, took root during the period he has labelled Sattelzeit. The third part of the paper explicitly focuses on the widespread idea that the modernist, future-oriented concept of time no longer holds and is therefore in need of reinterpretation. Among others, the discussion includes Hartog’s hypothesis of the rise of the presentist regime of historicity manifested, for example, by the contemporary preoccupation with memory and heritage. Furthermore, it is shown that as attitudes towards the past diversify, the modernist assumption of the past as separate from the present is rendered questionable. This in turn has lead scholars to work out alternative conceptions of time that could do justice to the past that refuses to let go of the present. Berber Bevernage’s ideas are mentioned as an example of an author who has taken steps in this direction. Ultimately, the idea is articulated that insofar as the status of the past proves to be increasingly ambivalent, the foundations of academic history also become questionable. In relation to that, many have argued that the rise of memory studies is another sign of the current tendency to rearticulate the relationship between past and present within historical studies. In the fourth and final part of the paper, some recent attempts to rearticulate the relationship between past and present in the philosophy of history are scrutinized. Particularly, the outlines of two philosophical projects, those of Eelco Runia and David Carr, are sketched. Most importantly, it is shown that both authors aim to go beyond the framework of representation – a dominant trend in the field within the last couple of decades – by introducing ways the past can be experienced as something real and directly given. In wrapping up the results, it is observed that based on the recent literature, diverse and multifaceted interest in the subject of time and temporality can be identified that shapes some of the most important contemporary discussions in the humanities."

10.1093/oso/9780198816669.003.0002,Inconsistent Philosophy,"The chapter considers the philosophical implications of the Rose’s literary style, showing how it relates to the institutional context of the University of Paris in the 1270s. It examines figurative language’s potential for discussing the irrational subject of love or desire, analysing how Jean de Meun draws on the earlier poetry of Andreas Capellanus and Alain de Lille to produce a paradoxical style that plays definition against indefinition. The prologue of Bishop Etienne Tempier’s condemnation of 1277 is interpreted as an attempt to restrict philosophical utterances to definite propositions simpliciter and not allowing hypothetical statements secundum quid. The Rose signals its opposition to Tempier by reworking Andreas Capellanus’s De amore (condemned in 1277) and by parodying Tempier in the figure of Genius. The result is a mode of philosophical proceeding that is anti-authoritative even as it depends on the utterances of earlier authors."

This chapter explores Gandhi’s cardinal principles, which constitute the ethical ideal from which human values are derived. In discussing Gandhi’s dharma, we focus on the relativity and context-relatedness of values and the existential base of morality. We emphasize Gandhi’s relentless search for the appropriate moral act in a given situation. Our approach in this regard is somewhat at variance with that of those who see in Gandhi a fixed moral order. We locate Gandhi’s dharma in Hindu thought and Buddhist teachings. However, it is not difficult to find a similar base in Christianity and fit Gandhi into a more comprehensive ideological framework. Our focus by choice is limited to Gandhi’s native traditions."

Gandhi abhorred the caste system but saw merit in varnashramadharma, which posed challenges of interpretation. His views on gender equality, the crusade against untouchability, and his relentless efforts to bring about communal harmony are some of Gandhi’s significant contributions to social change with varying degrees of success."

The work of the winner, János Hetényi, published in 1841, has found the equilibrium between the topics of the city and nation as ideal wholes, within a framework of a historical analysis of the urbanity of the public philosophy. This model of the urban(e) nation, organized by the cities as cultural centres was worked out in the optimistic decades of the Hungarian Reform Era (1825–1848), only; on its margins has appeared the known elements of the cultural criticism of the next epochs, such as the topics of a sinful and (ethnically) alien city."

The theory of Constant Immanence or renewal of creation expressed by Ibn Arabi can be regarded as an umbrella term to read the selected poems of Sepehri and Wordsworth and detect the similarities between these poets of two distinct milieu. Ibn Arabi’s innovative ideas of constantly renewing creation of the cosmos, the relationship between Man and Nature, Perfect Man and the love of religion have been depicted impressively centuries later in Sepehri’s and Wordsworth’s works. There is a wide tendency to compare the poems of these two poets of different milieu due to their special outlook to nature and their very individualistic worlds and their wide acceptance by both elite and common readers of poetry."

These criteria are used to determine how certain NOS dimensions are mentioned and elaborated in those textbooks. Such dimensions emphasize that chemistry is (1) tentative, (2) empirical, (3) model-based, (4) inferential, (5) has technological products, (6) employs instrumentation, and (7) possesses social and societal dimensions. Three book chapters were read and evaluated: the first (on chemistry in general); the second (on atomic structure); and the sixth or seventh chapters (on the electronic structure of atoms). The relevant content in each textbook were rated using the following rubric: Satisfactory and Explicit (S, 2 points); Mention and Implicit (M, 1 point); and No Mention (N, 0 point). Silberberg (2009) has the highest score among the six textbooks with 12 points out of the maximum of 14. It was rated S for five criteria, the most among the six textbooks. Despite the presence of some N evaluations, all textbooks have mentioned some or all of the NOS dimensions formulated, resulting to M and S ratings. This study concludes that NOS dimensions are already present in various ways and varying degrees in each textbook."
10.1515/opth-2016-0073,Recognition in Feminist Philosophy of Religion,"AbstractG. W. F. Hegel’s idea of recognition has become one of the central concepts of social and political philosophy and social theory. In feminist philosophy of religion recognition has also a prominent role. One problem which troubles philosophical discussions of recognition is the lack of adequate communication between different research traditions. This article describes briefly the original source of inspiration of contemporary discussions of recognition, Hegel’s own idea of recognition as it is narratively depicted in his Phenomenology of Spirit. It also takes up Hegel’s problematic views of women and the sphere of the family. The text tries to show how the Hegelian ideas have inspired three prominent feminist philosophers of religion: Luce Irigaray, Grace M. Jantzen and Pamela Sue Anderson. These philosophers are connected to the two ways of reading Hegel: the (predominantly) French tradition and the Critical Theory. It is argued that while Irigaray and Jantzen present important criticisms of the prevailing religious attitudes, they are unable to combine this criticism with a feminist view that would allow religion to be taken seriously. In this respect, Anderson’s – still undeveloped – theory of recognition is a more promising attempt."

10.17507/jltr.0706.09,Dickens’s Neutral Philosophy of the French Revolution in A Tale of Two Cities,"This paper delves into Charles Dickens’s objectivity of the events of the French Revolution and his unique stand and transparency in his representation for the two great power rivals and their prolonged conflict. The pre-revolutionary period was remarkable for the tyranny, cruelty, Socioeconomic-Inequality, and Subjugation of the Barbarous aristocratic rule against the masses. Conversely, the post-revolutionary period underwent sweeping social and political chaos and the form of administration set after the revolution was not a democracy, as French people were fond of calling it, but a mischievous and shameful anarchy lasted from 1789 until 1799. This discussion is an attempt to analyze and sort out a complex of hostile relationships involving the aristocrats and the peasants of A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens’ universal appeal indicates that whoever is in authority, aristocracy or masses, will get lavishly tempted to practice their full power depressingly and be obsessed with the dilemma of the establishment of the supremacy and dictatorship at any cost ignoring other’s right in decent life , freedom ,and equal opportunity. As the novel advanced, oppression is shown to breed oppression; violence to beget violence, evil to provoke evil. Instead of progress there is something more like the catastrophic continuum and piling wreckage upon wreckage."

Православное религиозное мировоззрение, идея всеединства, гуманизм и антропоцентризм - все эти важнейшие черты русской религиозной философии нашли свое отражение в сложной и метафизической проблеме духовности. Анализируется проблема духовности в русской религиозной философии с использованием реконструкции при помощи метода системного анализа. Основными структурными единицами проблемы духовности в русской религиозной философии стали такие понятия, как «человек», «природа», «бессмертие», «бесконечность», «свобода», «любовь», «творчество», «духовная телесность». Выявлен принципиальный и комплексный характер проблемы духовности в русской религиозной философии, который раскрывает одновременно антропоцентрический и космоцентрический аспекты этой проблемы в данной традиции. Важнейшим и ключевым для всех русских религиозных философов является понимание сути духовности и духовного не как противоположности материальному, а как его этическое и эстетическое изменение, преобразование, преображение.

Then, in moving beyond mere exposition, the chapter turns to a meta-theoretical discussion of international law, and in particular to how international legal theory should best be conceived and conducted. The chapter argues for the development of normative legal philosophies of international law that take the normativity of law and hence its legality more seriously than international legal theorists have so far, but also than moral philosophers of international law have themselves, thus breaking away from the sterile oppositions between ‘realist’ and so-called ‘moralist’ approaches to international law."

These notions range from systematic considerations such as the subdivision of certain legal categories, to moral and ethical concepts like justice and natural law. Even though there are many methodological difficulties associated with exploring the  relation between Greek philosophy and Roman law, it seems certain the Roman jurists employed Greek philosophy in a scientific manner in their legal practice, to define and elucidate points of law, and perhaps even to develop new legal theories."

It is a measure of the transformation that is currently underway in the field that the present Handbook gives roughly equal weight to every century from the ninth to the twentieth. The Handbook differs from previous overviews in another significant way: It is work-centered rather than person- or theme-centered. This format is intended to give readers a better sense of what a work in Islamic philosophy looks like, and of the issues, concepts, and arguments that are at play in works belonging to various periods and subfields within Islamic philosophy."

10.1515/sats-2016-0015,Aarhus Lectures – Fourth Lecture: The Very Idea of a Philosophy of Mythology in Contemporary Philosophy,"AbstractIn this fourth, concluding part of the Aarhus Lectures, I want to make sense of some features of Schelling’s positive philosophy in light of the fundamental idea of a philosophy of mythology. I believe that it is at least worth inquiring to what extent something like the so-called scientific world-picture – as well as the associated prominent insistence on normativity as a potential mark of autonomous mindedness as opposed to blind law-governed natural events – is embedded in a mythology. Genealogical points of this form are typically invoked in order to make room for an alternative. In Schelling’s case, the ultimate alternative (revelation) consists in overcoming the mythological condition of human consciousness as we know it altogether. However, like later modern eschatologists of a similar stripe (such as Heidegger and Derrida), he does not flesh out the alternative without creating another mythology, which is why in the second part of his positive philosophy, the Philosophy of Revelation, he resorts to revelation as a counter-myth to mythology, to an event that is not under the control of any kind of theory-building. Be that as it may, in the preparation of his triumphalist story about revelation, Schelling offers resources for a critical account of modernity’s constitutive mythology that he brings to bear in his critique of Hegel in ways not yet sufficiently explored in contemporary philosophy."

Accordingly, both turn from the logic of theory to the logic of practice. However, where Marx sees the relations of production as leading to class struggle and revolution, Bourdieu sees bodily practice as instilling symbolic domination through habitus. This leads Marx and Bourdieu to adopt divergent views of history, divergent approaches to social change, divergent roots of symbolic domination, and divergent perspectives on contentious politics. If the followers of Marx seek to explain the quiescence of the working class by developing theories of cultural hegemony, will the followers of Bourdieu build a research program that focuses on the internal contradictions and external anomalies of Bourdieu’s theory of symbolic domination?"
10.1515/apeiron-2015-0063,Abstraction and Diagrammatic Reasoning in Aristotle’s Philosophy of Geometry,"AbstractAristotle’s philosophy of geometry is widely interpreted as a reaction against a Platonic realist conception of mathematics. Here I argue to the contrary that Aristotle is concerned primarily with the methodological question of how universal inferences are warranted by particular geometrical constructions. His answer hinges on the concept of abstraction, an operation of “taking away” certain features of material particulars that makes perspicuous universal relations among magnitudes. On my reading, abstraction is a diagrammatic procedure for Aristotle, and it is through imagined variation of diagrams that one can universalize spatial inferences. In order to shift the discussion of Aristotle’s work on geometry from ontological to methodological questions, I argue in the first section that geometrical properties for Aristotle are necessary accidents of the particulars, canonically diagrams, in which they inhere. I then consider a line of research that shows how diagrams in ancient geometry are not illustrations of the textual proof but are in part constitutive of geometrical inference, an insight I claim can shed light on Aristotle’s philosophical project. Next I substantiate this assertion by giving an alternative interpretation of abstraction according to which it is a diagrammatic procedure that allows a part of a particular diagram to stand in for a universal. In the last section, I consider Aristotle’s account of mathematical cognition, arguing that there is evidence for the view that imagination is necessary both for the construction of figures, and for their presentation as abstractions subject to universal inference."

10.1515/jlt-2018-0009,Towards a Philosophy of Rhythm: Nietzsche’s Conflicting Rhythms,"Abstract
In recent years, theories of rhythm have been proposed by a number of different disciplines, including historical poetics, generative metrics, cognitive literary studies, and evolutionary aesthetics. The wide range of fields indicates the transdisciplinary nature of rhythm as a phenomenon, as well as its complexity, highlighting the degree to which many of the central questions surrounding rhythm remain extraordinarily difficult even to state in terms that can traverse the disciplinary boundaries effortlessly transgressed by rhythm as a phenomenon. In particular, any theory of rhythm, whether in music, dance, sociology, or language, must grapple with two quandaries. First, the precise site of rhythm remains opaque: rhythms occur in, affect, and are produced by all of bodies, cultures, and universals (whether metaphysical or species-physiological). What is the relation between species-wide characteristic, individual body, cultural context, and the history of art making in the experience of rhythm? Second, rhythm is simultaneously a phenomenon of fixed, organizing form and one of dynamic, changing flow. How can rhythm encompass both the measurement of regular recurrences across time and the organizing of temporal phenomena as they unfold?
In this article, I draw on Emile Benveniste and Henri Meschonnic to elucidate these quandaries or conflicts before turning to Friedrich Nietzsche’s work on rhythm. I argue that Nietzsche’s work with rhythm provides a historically situated model for how we might continue to take the questions and conflicts within rhythm seriously, rather than privileging an abstract and universally applicable theory of rhythm. This model is especially crucial for our own historical moment, when cultural-political emphasis on science and technology at the expense of aesthetics devalues all insights not presented in the form of countable data points or empirically testable facts. Nietzsche is, of course, one of the great critics of positivist-scientistic epistemologies, part of a long tradition questioning the naturalness of natural-scientific paradigms and alerting us to the metaphors at play even in the ›hard sciences‹. I use rhythm as one paradigmatic place to resist the importation of scientistic thought into discussions of language, literature, and culture. I show how Nietzsche’s writings on rhythm prove illuminating for contemporary understandings of rhythm because the tensions in his work are shaped by the quandaries inherent to rhythm that I have used Benveniste and Meschonnic to elaborate, namely the question of rhythm’s site as individual, cultural, or universal, and the conflict between rhythm as form and as flow. The question of the site of rhythm appears in Nietzsche’s discussions of Greek and Latin meters both in his philological works, in his aphorisms, and in his letters: on the one hand, he argues that Greek and Latin metrical and rhythmic resources are irrevocably lost to modern cultures (indicating that rhythm is a product of culture), while on the other, he emphasizes the impact of rhythm on the body and offers advice for replicating Ancient metrical and rhythmic techniques (suggesting that rhythm is based on physiological universals). And the conflict between flow and form appears as Nietzsche praises both the productive constraint created by large-scale, architectonic, or macro-formal rhythms and the freedom from such constraint enabled by small-scale, leitmotiv-based, or micro-formal rhythms.
The conflicts in Nietzsche’s work between the loss and recovery of Ancient rhythms and between rhythm as small scale freedom vs. large scale constraint thus represent one particular unfolding of the dilemmas for rhythmical theory worked out by Benveniste and Meschonnic. The various modern disciplines engaged with rhythm will answer different sets of these questions in different ways. Most practitioners of, e. g., evolutionary aesthetics, neuroaesthetics, or cognitive poetics would no doubt contend that they are using the tools of the natural sciences to investigate long-standing humanistic inquiries. Nietzsche, as a critic of his own era’s scientific positivism who allows tensions inherent in these questions to remain open in his own work, is an ideal interlocutor with whom to ask whether even the adoption of these tools ends up placing excessive faith in natural-scientific paradigms and undercutting other—affective, bodily, metaphorical, poetic, etc.—ways of knowing, as I demonstrate briefly in the examples of evolutionary aesthetics and generative metrics.
Because Nietzsche leaves open the conflicts over rhythm’s site and its qualities as form or flow, he can use individual bodily experience to make physiological arguments about the effects of rhythm on culture and vice versa: Nietzsche takes his bodily response to be an index of cultural values inherent to rhythmical practices. The particular values that Nietzsche critiques shift across his career—early on he condemns German musical and poetic rhythms for being too rigid, while later he sees them as pathologically heightening affect and emotion. In both cases, detrimental rhythmic practices lead to detrimental bodily practices and to the degeneration of culture, while rhythmic practices work as a bodily and cultural corrective. In his critiques of German forms and praises of Greek forms, and in the moments in which he brings them together, Nietzsche thus asserts the complex interrelation of culture, body, and history."
10.4102/hts.v72i3.3542,Non-philosophical Christ-poetics beyond the mystical turn in conversation with continental philosophy of religion,"The religious turn in continental philosophy has opened the door for postmetaphysical mystical theology. Postmetaphysical mystical theology seeks to understand the non-relation relation of language (text) to the Other. Yet, this non-relation relation to the Other, who is every other, can also be interpreted differently to the mystical understanding. For example, Žižek argues that the Other, which is often experienced as the uncanny, the unpredictable and the contingent (lived spirituality), is not necessarily the result of some mystical unknowable Otherness but is a consequence of the way the subject’s own activity is inscribed into reality. These experiences of lived spirituality or experiences of Otherness can, rather than being interpreted as an in-breaking of the mystical Other, be interpreted otherwise, as a grammatological consequence of the inability and impossibility of language (Lacan). Therefore, in this article, Žižek’s thoughts function as a bridge to bring this mystical turn back into critical conversation with continental philosophy and particularly with the thoughts of Derrida, Laruelle and Stiegler. The contemporary mystical turn in theology rediscovers something of this non-religious religion. Derrida’s thoughts are in close proximity to negative theology and yet there is an important difference. This difference will be explored and further developed towards Laruelle’s non-philosophy, which does not translate into a non-religion religion or postmetaphysical metaphysics but remains a non-philosophy or maybe a science of Christ. This article will conclude with a tentative exploration of a postmetaphysical Christ-poetics beyond the mystical turn."

To make a major shift in our understanding of what the domain of SLA should be and what kind of theory should be developed entails thorough understanding of what happens in the history of SLA and relinquishing our absolute trust in the epistemology of a given school of thought. The purpose of present paper is to have a chronological review of the three main schools of scientific movements in SLA in harmony with their related philosophy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Samples are taken from two subcorpora of the Coruña Corpus of English Scientific Writing, one from the humanities (Philosophy) and the other from natural sciences (Life Sciences). The methodology applied is based on Biber’s (1988) Multidimensional Analysis, consisting of a study of register variation as manifested through sets of co-occurring linguistic features with a shared discursive function. The aim of the present study is to detect variation across scientific disciplines, genres, and subject matter. Findings are compared to those found in both diachronic and contemporary reference corpora."

Facing unprecedented waves of re-traditionalisation and radicalisation in both Israel and Arab-Muslim societies this issue has become a privileged terrain upon which many ideological, cultural and political “wars” have been waged. In this paper, I shall focus on how two prominent philosophers and public thinkers, Leibowitz (d. 1994) and al-Jaberi (d. 2010), have brought the issue of the relation between faith and reason – and with it critical thinking – back to centre stage by engaging both their own philosophical and theological traditions and European philosophical thought. "
10.1017/s0265052516000376,ON THE VERY IDEA OF IDEAL THEORY IN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY,"Abstract:
            The essay agues that there is little scope for ideal theory in political
                    philosophy, even under Rawls’s conception of its aims. It begins by
                    identifying features of a standard example of ideal theory in physics
                    — the ideal gas law, PV=NRT and draws attention to the
                    lack of these features in Rawls’s derivation of the principles of
                    justice from the original position. A. John Simmons’s defense of
                    ideal theory against criticisms of Amartya Sen is examined, as are further
                    criticisms of both by David Schmidtz. The essay goes on to develop a conception
                    of the domain of social relations to be characterized by justice that suggests
                    that as a moving target it makes ideal theory otiose. Examination of
                    Rawls’s later views substantiate the conclusion that ideal theory as
                    propounded in A Theory of Justice is a mistaken starting point in the enterprise
                    of political philosophy. Differences between the domains of ideal theory in
                    mathematics, physics, and economics on the one hand, and political philosophy on
                    the other, reinforce this conclusion."

10.21462/ijefll.v1i2.7,An Investigation into the Educational Philosophy and Spirituality of Iranian EFL Teachers,"Although philosophy and spirituality are related to various branches of disciplines, they have not been subject to focused attention in foreign language teaching. In this paper, schools of educational philosophy, and spirituality in education were connected together to present the stance, viewpoint, and practice of these two constructs in English as foreign language (EFL) Iranian educators. Results indicated that the dominant philosophy of education of Iranian EFL teachers was progressive education. Furthermore, combination of progressive and humanistic philosophies and humanistic philosophy were to some extent established a balance with progressivism. None of the participants practice spirituality in classrooms. By illuminating the spiritual language of humanistic and progressive philosophies, we may conclude that the nature and spiritual discourse of each philosophy as well as their practical implications should be articulated in teacher education programs to fulfill the everlasting growth of an individual as an utmost purpose of education."
10.1515/cpt-2016-0005,Philosophy from an ‘Anthropological’ Point of View,"AbstractIn this paper I shall try to introduce a few aspects on the possible influence Piero Sraffa had on Wittgenstein’s later philosophy. Although we do not have many explicit sources, we find a few remarks in Wittgenstein’s manuscripts that contain Sraffa’s name in brackets. And interestingly enough they almost all deal with the fundamental relation between rules and empirical propositions. Wittgenstein raises questions such as: Do grammatical rules only say that words are actually used in a particular way? Do mathematical propositions describe how human beings usually calculate? Are the rules of chess descriptions of how the game has always been played? Wittgenstein’s discussions of these questions also had an impact on his philosophical turn towards an ‘anthropological’ point of view."
10.1017/s147717561600035x,A PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION: OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE ECONOMY,"The topics of education and the role of educational institutions in society are seldom far from the headlines, the lips of politicians, schoolteachers and parents. Discussion of education (and its associated institutions) within these forums tends to assume uncritically that its ultimate point is to benefit the economy and, by extension, empower the individual through increased prestige and material wealth. This article argues that such a conception of education is misguided and, indeed dangerous, as it estranges us from forms of thought that are frequently united with our conception of what it means to be human, alongside damaging prospects of long-term economic welfare. It is, therefore, the responsibility of our educational institutions to maintain a critical resistance to the culture of the times by ensuring that they do not merely become factories that train their students in ways purely designed to maximize economic impact and increased personal wealth."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190236953.013.24,Rights and Identity in Latin American Philosophy,"Two issues of Latin American political philosophy have attracted considerable attention. The first is controversy about human rights, prompted by the European expansions that took place during the Iberian Conquest and colonial ruling that followed, and today, by the phenomenon of contemporary globalization. The second issue concerns the identity of Latin Americans and their descendants abroad—namely, who they are as a people, and what they should be culturally and ethnically or racially. These questions have prompted Latin American philosophical theorizing since the early nineteenth-century Wars of Independence, to this day."

Mills here looks at the influence of the racial contract (disquotationally, as a racist reality) on the views of white political philosophers and on the formation of modern white-dominated racial polities, as well as the possible use of the “racial contract” to theorize corrective racial justice. Finally, he discusses the reception of his book, The Racial Contract, in the twenty years since its publication."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190236953.013.7,Racial Profiling and the Political Philosophy of Race,"Philosophical reflection on racial profiling takes one of two forms. The first sees it as an example of “statistical discrimination,” raising the question of when, if ever, probabilistic generalizations about group behavior or characteristics can be used to judge particular individuals. The second is concerned with how racial profiling illuminates the reproduction of hierarchies of power and privilege based on skin color and morphology. Insights from both approaches can be synthesized to clarify what, if anything, is wrong with racial profiling and what broader conclusions for equality and security follow from the study of profiling."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190236953.013.60,Gender Theory in Philosophy of Race,"The subject of critical race theory is implicitly black men, and the main idea is race. The subject of feminism is implicitly white women, and the main idea is gender. When the main idea is race, gender loses its importance and when the main idea is gender, race loses its importance. In both cases, women of color, especially black women, are left out. Needed is a new critical theory to address the oppression of nonwhite, especially black, women. Critical plunder theory would begin with the facts of uncompensated appropriation of the biological products of women of color, such as sexuality and children."
10.1515/opth-2017-0009,Revelation in Nicolas Berdyaev’s Religious Philosophy,"AbstractNicolas Berdyaev’s understanding of the self-revelation of God to humankind is a point of connection between the central ideas of his religious philosophy. Berdyaev says that God’s self-revelation occurs within the inner person, through divine-human spiritual cooperation, bringing about a revolutionary transformation of the human consciousness. Yet, the degree to which revelation can occur depends on human spiritual development. The eschatological culmination of this development will be the revelation of God in humankind and humankind in God-fulfilling the Godmanhood of Christ. The content of revelation is the Truth that is Godself, expressed in relational knowledge of God. Revelation occurs as an activity of divine-human cooperation. It is affected by human limitations and must be open to critique, particularly to purge from it human categories of dominance, power and enslavement. Truth is its own criterion, but in sobornost there is a sense of communal discernment. Only in freedom may revelation and truth may be found."

After the independence of Bangladesh in 1980s safety net programmes has been adopted to reduce poverty from Bangladesh. At present 30 social safety net programmes are now operation in Bangladesh. The objective of the study is to find challenges ahead to implement Social Safety Net (SSN) programmes that initiated to reduce poverty at rural areas specially. The article is based on content analysis method and secondary data has been used to conduct the study. The study found that there is various weakness in social safety net policies. There is lack of integration and coordination among different safety net programmes and providers. Political stability is one of the great obstacle to fulfill the ultimate goal of safety net programmes. The extent, nature and mechanism of safety net programs change with the change of government. Besides this, corruption, shortage of budget etc hinder the implementation of safety net programmes. However, high political commitment, increase allocation, better targeting beneficiary, involvement of NGOs, civil society, monitoring and overseeing, reduction of corruption should be ensured.  "

I trace some of the nineteenth and twentieth century contours of this effort. In doing so I outline an understanding of ourselves as norm-laden persons in a natural world. As a consequence, philosophical inquiry—understood in C. S. Peirce's sense as the practice of the ‘normative sciences’ of aesthetics, logic, and ethics—can be understood as the self-conscious and rational exercise of natural and socially conditioned capacities to sense, think, and act. This leaves us with a project, by no means completed, to frame categories through which to understand thesociohistorical developmentof the notions of beauty, truth, and goodness as a process continuous with thenatural evolutionof the nervous system in its sensory, central, and motor moments."

Pairing this scheme with the work of Jaspers (1955, 1971) affords the opportunity for scholars and practitioners to understand, visualize, and potentially reconcile these phenomena under an established philosophical umbrella.

10.21476/pp.2017.2267,Performance Philosophy: audience participation and responsibility,"This article critically assesses the position of the spectator in philosophy and (participatory) performances. By means of an in-depth reading of Rancière’s notion of the emancipated spectator, Kester’s theory of dialogical aesthetics and a case study of the performance Order of the Day, an account of the changing position of the audience in contemporary society and in artistic events is established.  Research into the responsibility of the spectator in both philosophy and performance can broaden our understanding of the production and perception of knowledge in an age of media omnipresence. The field of Performance Philosophy provides potential for analyzing where performance and philosophy overlap and how this contributes to asking critical questions and generating new perspectives on how we occupy certain positions in society."
10.21476/pp.2017.2264,Fabric Philosophy: The “Texture” of Theatricality and Performativity,"As metaphors of human existence, the idioms of theatricality and performativity both fluctuate between values of novelty and normativity: theatricality, between the essence of an art form and a cultural value variously opposed or embraced, performativity, between doing and dissimulation. To revert from drawing too sharp boundaries, either between the two phenomena or between their cognate art forms and everyday life, the article pursues to analyse them in “textural” terms specifically inspired by Tim Ingold’s ecological anthropology and Stephen C. Pepper’s philosophical pragmatism from the 1940s. Where Ingold’s ecology of lines admits to “no insides or outsides,” “trailing loose ends in every direction,” Pepper’s “contextualistic world” of events admits “no top nor bottom” to its strands and textures. After introducing Ingold’s networks of connected objects and meshworks of interwoven lines as shorthand terms for specifically theatrical and performative textures, their various dynamics are considered in terms of absorption and abstraction: on a global scale – I briefly consider the Anthropos(c)ene as theatrum mundi – seeing all the world as a stage indeed depends on something of a theatrical inversion of its lines of becoming. From the tensions of novelty and normativity, noted above, what emerges is a fabric philosophy of weaving and zooming between overlapping textures: if the performative names a dramaturgy of becoming, then the theatrical provides an optic for its analysis."

10.7146/nja.v23i42.5872,The Music of Thinking: A Literary Experiment with the Great Themes of Philosophy,"In his book Theorien (Frankfurt am Main: S. Fischer, 2009) Martin Seel presents a philosophical and literary experiment in which he desists from introducing a single grand theory in favour of offering a number of smaller theories. In an aphoristic manner these personal and poetic observations are linked to rigorous reflections on the classical themes of human selfunderstanding: happiness and morality, failure and beauty, sickness and death, sense and understanding, knowledge and freedom, religion and music. Staying clear of disciplinary formations, the author shuffles the cards of epistemology, ethics and aesthetics in order to address philosophy as a whole without extinguishing its fire within the confines of a systematic edifice. This collection of shortcuts can be read from beginning to end, or backwards, or starting in the middle; as a reflection on thinking; a play with the voices of passion; a variation on foundations and pitfalls of action; a defence of the indeterminate in all that is determinate; as a fragment of a prosaic confession. These heterogeneous gestures unfold an improvised text that tracks the uncertainties of life and of writing. This text is an excerpt from the book, published in Die Zeit no. 37, September, 2009."

10.7146/tifo.v9i1.25343,Tradition and Modernity in Contemporary Islamic Philosophy,"In the aftermath of the cultural renaissance movement (naḥḍa), especially during the second half of the 20th century, philosophy succeeded in regaining the status it enjoyed in medieval times as an important part of the Muslim intellectual discourse. In recent decades, philosophical thought (falsafa) has gained more prominence and relevance, especially with regard to the Islamic debate about the role and function of the Islamic tradition in the contemporary modern world. In this debate, Muslim philosophers deal with various questions and issues, foremost among them: the concept of knowledge, the wider question of reform (iṣlāḥ), and the relationship between religion and secularism. How Muslim thinkers and philosophers understand the questions and how they answer them vary widely, depending on their methodological approach to these issues - metaphysics, historicity, hermeneutics, and deconstruction – as well as their different positions regarding the role of philosophy in relation to contemporary Islām in general and its role in understanding the Islamic tradition’s relation with modernity in particular. The aim of this paper is to shed some light on the methodological diversity in contemporary Muslim philosophy, through readings of the work of four thinkers."

It first provides an overview of the philosophy of mind, focusing on its basic metaphysical orientation as well as its concern with mental states. It then considers some basic paradigms in the philosophy of mind and what generative grammar had to contribute to these paradigms, which include behaviourism, eliminative materialism, anomalous monism, instrumentalism, and functionalism. It also discusses what we might call the ‘philosophy of generative grammar,’ and especially foundational assumptions in generative grammar, and examines what the linguistic contribution to the philosophy of mind has been. The article concludes by reflecting on the future and outlining current visions for where and how linguistics might prove to have a transformative influence on philosophy."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573776.013.3,Universal Grammar and Philosophy of Language,"Universal Grammar (UG) is a parametric system that establishes individual norms for language users. This is the sense in which UG is part of a competence theory instead of a performance theory. By establishing individual norms it does not control our linguistic behavior but acts as a kind of regulator that warns us when we diverge from an optimal set-point value. These warnings take the form of linguistic judgments. These linguistic judgments are surfacey—they don’t tell us what rules have been violated; they merely tell us when something is amiss, or which of two forms is more optimal. They are merely judgments of acceptability. While this approach leads us into the rule-following arguments of Wittgenstein and Kripke, those arguments can be defused if handled with care."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199607617.013.39,Probability in Philosophy of Language,"This chapter uses four historically important approaches to conditionals to help illustrate ways of thinking about the language of subjective uncertainty more broadly construed. On the first, conditionals express propositions and `if' is a truth-functional connective. Problems here motivate the second hypothesis-that a conditional expresses a proposition the probability of which equals the probability of the consequent conditional on its antecedent. Problems for this approach in turn motivate a third kind of view on which conditionals do not express propositions that are true or false. According to one such approach, `if' has a non-compositional meaning: it is used to help express conditional beliefs in a special, non-semantic way. The costs of abandoning compositionality motivate the final family of views considered, on which compositional semantic interpretation functions output non-propositional objects; therefore semanticists can and should help themselves to tools developed by formal epistemologists."

This chapter explores these connections through discussion of two classic arguments: the fine-tuning argument and Pascal’s Wager. The formulation and assessment of both arguments relies upon increasingly sophisticated applications of the probability calculus and other formal tools. Two themes emerge from a survey of recent work. First, diverse forms of ‘philosophical technology’ are invaluable in constructing precise models, clarifying objections and identifying new approaches to venerable arguments concerning the existence of God and the rationality of religious belief. Second, benefits flow in the reverse direction as well: the philosophy of religion is fertile ground for testing ideas in formal epistemology and decision theory."

This century was the setting for many complicated changes that gave birth to Christianity as it is commonly understood. Naming, and the use of the terms ‘outsiders’ and ‘followers of Christ’ to define those we would call ‘Christians’, were important parts of this process. Examining how early Christians presented themselves can help us to understand the development of both Christianity and Judaism, and also to appreciate better how the early Christians saw themselves. Justin Martyr (100-65) is a central figure in this task. This essay will analyse his presentation, at a crucial point in history, of what it meant to be a follower of Christ."

            In this essay an attempt is made to transcend the divide between realists and anti-realists in the philosophy of history by proposing an alternative account of understanding the past, one based on the nature of testimonies, specifically their scope and depth. This is done through a critical engagement with the works of prominent realist and anti-realist philosophers of history (Bevir/Lorenz and Ankersmit/White, respectively); other philosophers working on relevant topics such as epistemology, and historians who have written on historical method. The alternative account thus developed is then tested by applying it to the case of the Historikerstreit, the bitterly waged historian's struggle concerning the history and legacy of Nazism. On the surface it appears to affirm the anti-realist position that posits historical narratives as being inherently normative/aesthetic given the inadequacies of the ‘thick’ realist position, but upon closer scrutiny it demonstrates the merit of my alternative, testimony-based ‘thin’ realist account."

            At the phenomenological level, consciousness has been referred to as “what vanishes every night when we fall into dreamless sleep and reappears when we wake up or when we dream. It is also all we are and all we have: lose consciousness and, as far as you are concerned, your own self, and the entire world dissolves into nothingness”. According to the integrated information theory, consciousness is integrated information.
            The term “consciousness” therefore has two key senses: wakefulness and awareness. Wakefulness is a state of consciousness distinguished from coma or sleep. Having one's eyes open is generally an indication of wakefulness and we usually assume that anyone who is awake will also be aware. Awareness implies not merely being conscious but also being conscious of something. The broad definition of consciousness includes a large range of processes that we normally regard as unconscious (eg, blindsight or priming by neglected or masked stimuli).
            Both sleep and anesthesia are reversible states of eyes-closed unresponsiveness to environmental stimuli in which the individual lacks both wakefulness and awareness. In contrast to sleep, where sufficient stimulation will return the individual to wakefulness, even the most vigorous exogenous stimulation cannot produce awakening in a patient under an adequate level of general anesthesia."

10.7146/nts.v28i2.25520,Performance as Philosophy — the universal language of the theatre revisited,"The history of philosophy is widely considered as the history of exercises in speculation. However, it is also possible to understand philosophy not as the outcome of speculation, but at the attempt by philosophers to explain, make sense of, and ultimately share, their own experiences of a very subtle, powerful and spiritual nature. The growing field of performance philosophy begins to acknowledge the potential of considering philosophy as an expression of immediate experience rather than distant speculation. This acknowledgement can take the shape of employing performance to express philosophy — in more immediately experienced ways than verbal language is ever able to convey. Writing about this non-verbal dimension is difficult, and the result limited by its very nature, but in this article, we discuss the principle, and provide an example in the performance philosophy, captured under the term of body thinking, of German philosopher and dancer Aurelia Baumgartner."

This article delivered the comparison of both thoughts regarding to the Greek philosophy, while extensively influenced by the Greek philosophical tradition with two different responses. Thaha Husein so fascinated to the Greek philosophical traditions in which he developed appreciatively as found on his works. While al-Aqqad, he almost concerned on reviewing the value of the Greek philosophical tradition. His interaction to them feels more rigid because he used to accentuate his Arabian color and manifested his resistence when interacting with the Greek philosophical tradition. On several occasions, Al-Aqqad more often criticized them as compared to Thaha Husain. Well-known as westernized, Thaha Husain, instead of being uncritical of Greek philosophy, to him, the beginning of Greek philosophy formulation somehow indicated through their interaction with the Eastern culture. As said, East in the past became a source and reference, albeit limited to the physical aspect. While al-Aqqad, he viewed uncertainly whether Greek or East is the major source of the early emergence of philosophy as a scientific tradition.Keywords:Greek Philosophy, Islamic Philosophy, West, East"

O objetivo de criar uma nova psicologia para uma sociedade que necessitava de princípios orientados para justiça social e igualdade transformou esta abordagem em um projeto crítico-prático de transformação social e de mudança. O principal argumento em que este trabalho avança é que o cerne do método de Vygotsky é a transformação onto-epistemológica, juntamente com a ética sócio-política de igualdade e justiça, que desafiam a ideologia de adaptação e controle. Eu discuto este conjunto de questões à luz de uma postura ativista de transformação que ilumina sobre os compromissos dos pesquisadores e orientações de valor."

10.1017/hgl.2017.1,Comprehending Sociality: Hegel Beyond his Appropriation in Contemporary Philosophy of Recognition,"Abstract
            Contemporary philosophy of recognition represents probably the most prominent direction that presently claims to introduce an updated version of classical German idealism into ongoing debates, including the debate on the nature of sociality. In particular, studies of Axel Honneth offer triggering contributions in Frankfurt School fashion while at the same time rejuvenating Hegel’s philosophy in terms of a philosophy of recognition. According to Honneth, this attempt at a rejuvenation also involves substantial modification of Hegelian doctrines. It is shown that Honneth underestimates the implications of Hegel’s thoughts about the theme, method and systematic form of philosophy. As a consequence, Honneth’s social philosophy is, on the one hand, in need of a plausible foundation. This leads, on the other hand, to a different construction of the social within philosophy than Honneth offers."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199340385.013.39,Political Philosophy in an Unstable World,"For many readers, the perspectives of Plato and Thucydides are fundamentally incompatible. Plato’s authentic philosophers allegedly occupy an unchanging world of intellectual forms or ideas. Thucydides’ world is passionate and disrupted. If we agree with these assessments, we find two authors speaking such different languages that prospects for dialogue between them seem impossible. I want to challenge that conclusion by suggesting that we can read Thucydides and Plato more dialogically. I try to show how each author opens possibilities for dialogic engagement with his own text and then indicate areas of plausible exchange between them. This interactive reading avoids the binary frames of reference of abstract and illusory peace or ongoing and inescapable war, drawing attention to experiences in need of continued intellectual negotiation and opening spaces for practical improvement. Beyond expanding our understanding of these authors, such mutual readings help us to appreciate their contributions to conversational political theory."

This essay explores the applicability of the logic and rhetoric of inverse correlation in the cases of the early Daoist Zhuangzi, medieval Japanese Buddhist Shinran, and modern Protestant Christian Kierkegaard, as well as broader ramifications for contemporary philosophy of religion."
10.24204/ejpr.v5i2.236,Two Kinds of 'Christian Philosophy',"It is controversial whether ‘Christian Philosophy’ is a useful or even consistent notion. After providing some historical background to the problem, I will distinguish and explicate two possible understandings of ‘Christian Philosophy’ which should be kept apart: a ‘Thomistic’ and an ‘Augustinian’ one, of which the latter has garnered more attention in the recent literature. A sketch of the most prominent current ‘Augustinian’ position (Alvin Plantinga’s ‘reformed epistemology’) leads to some considerations for why a ‘Thomistic’ understanding of ‘Christian Philosophy’ has more to recommend it, if the term is regarded as useful at all."
10.24204/ejpr.v6i1.196,"Building Bridges and Crossing Boundaries: Philosophy, Theology, and the Interruptions of Transcendence","Discussions about theological realism within analytic philosophy of religion, and the larger conversation between analytic and continental styles in philosophy of religion have generated relatively little interest among Catholic philosophers and theologians; conversely, the work of major figures in recent Catholic theology seems to evoke little interest from analytic philosophers of religion. Using the 1998 papal encyclical on faith and reason, Fides et ratio, as a major point of reference, this essay offers a preliminary account of the bases for such seeming mutual indifference and offers some suggestions for future dialogue."
10.24204/ejpr.v1i1.332,Two Models of Radical Revelation in Austrian Philosophy,"In this paper I highlight two opposing models of the notion of divine revelation: the propositional and the radical. The propositional understanding of revelation was central to theology and philosophy until the 19th century. Since then, a number of other models of revelation have emerged. I define as radical the understanding of revelation which emphasizes two features of revelation: 1) God’s existence is *per se* revelatory; 2) God’s revelation is *per se* self-revelation. I propose too an assessment of the notion of propositional revelation as presented by Richard Swinburne. And I offer detailed analyses of two representatives of the early understanding of divine revelation as self-revelation: the views of Bernard Bolzano and Anton Günther. Bolzano, the renowned mathematician, was also a philosopher of religion; and Günther, one of the most ingenious writers in Austrian philosophy, was not only a theologian but also a philosopher comparable to the important figures of 19th century German thought. "
10.24204/ejpr.v4i4.265,Redefining Religious Truth as a Challenge for Philosophy of Religion,"One of the most important features of contemporary Western societies is the rise of (religious) pluralism. Whereas (philosophical) theism used to serve as a common ground to discuss the truth-claims of religion, this approach seems to have lost much of its plausibility. What I want to argue in this article is that philosophy of religion as a critical intellectual activity still cannot do without the notion of religious truth, but also that it needs to redefine this truth in an existential way, i.e. by interpreting religions as concrete ways of life. In this paper I develop this idea of religious truth by interpreting religions as traditions of wisdom, being a kind of truth that is able to orientate humans’ lives without being swayed by the issues of the day. In order to substantiate my interpretation I discuss three fundamental aspects of wisdom, viz. the fact that it rests on a broadened idea of reason, the way in which it discovers the universal in the particular, and the insight that all life-orientations are based on a principle that is subjectively adequate, but objectively inadequate (Kant)."
10.24204/ejpr.v2i2.370,Reconnecting the Philosophy of Religion and Engaged Religious Reasoning,"It is no surprise that the philosophy of religion, the many disciplines counted within the study of religion and theology, and religion-specific studies, all have their own methods and interests, and often proceed necessarily as conversations among small groups of experts. But the intellectual cogency and credibility of such studies also entails a problematization of the boundaries that divide them. While disciplinary distinctions are necessary and valuable, a freer flow of ideas and questions across boundaries is to the benefit of all concerned. In particular, the philosophy of religion proceeds more fruitfully if, among its several dimensions, it is also intentionally comparative and interreligious, vulnerable to the questions raised by insiders to traditions, and open to the implications of ideas for religious practice. "
10.24204/ejpr.v3i1.379,The Spiritual Senses in Western Spirituality and the Analytic Philosophy of Religion,"The doctrine of the spiritual senses has played a significant role in the history of Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox spirituality. What has been largely unremarked is that the doctrine also played a significant role in classical Protestant thought, and that analogous concepts can be found in Indian theism. In spite of the doctrine’s significance, however, the only analytic philosopher to consider it has been Nelson Pike. I will argue that his treatment is inadequate, show how the development of the doctrine in Puritan thought and spirituality fills a serious lacuna in Pike’s treatment, and conclude with some suggestions as to where the discussion should go next."
10.24204/ejpr.v3i1.380,I Called to God from a Narrow Place...

By evaluating “acceptability” I mean evaluation of: truth, morality, spiritual efficacy and human flourishing, in fact any value religious devotees might think significant to their religious lives. Secondly, I urge that philosophers of religion give more attention to what scholars have called the “esoteric” level of world religions, including components of strong ineffability, weak ineffability, and an alleged perennial philosophy. All this should involve a cooperative effort between analytic, comparative, and feminist philosophy of religion."
10.1515/jlt-2017-0007,Philosophy and the Lyric,"AbstractThe paper surveys and comments on some of the issues that arise about the lyric in philosophical, principally analytical, aesthetics. In brief these are: definition, expression, paraphrase, form-content unity, experience, and truth and profundity. The paper shows in each case why these issues are important from the perspective of analytical philosophy but also why lyric poetry is not always an easy subject matter to accommodate to standard analytical presuppositions. It might be thought that theories of meaning within philosophy of language (be it semantics, speech act theory or truth-conditions) should be applicable to a full range of linguistic usage. But lyric poetry confounds that expectation and yields a context where familiar models of meaning and communication can seem inadequate. Yet analytical philosophers should not simply dismiss poetry as somehow exceptional or aberrant but would gain from looking afresh at basic assumptions to see how their views about language might be broadened and modified."
10.24234/wisdom.v2i7.149, David the Invincible: Philosophy as a Lifestyle,"The most outstanding representative of the history of Armenian philosophy, Neoplatonic thinker of the V-VI centuries, David the Invincible continues the tradition reached the peak of its development in the Ancient Greece by Socrates and Plato, according to which philosophy is first of all a way of life, a means of transformation and perfection of the human being. Following the principles of the Greek Paideia David considers philosophy as a care of the soul, in which theory and practice are intertwined, and cognition of the world depends on the efforts of self-improvement by a subject. Author shows that in David’s definitions of philosophy is clearly seen the significance of self-formation, “zardarum” in the process of reality formation, comprehension or rethinking. It is also mentioned that we can use Michel  Foucault’s notion of the “care of the soul”  and Pierre Hadot’s notion of “spiritual practices’’ to characterize  David’s optimistic philosophy, which was developed further in the theories of Armenian thinkers Grigor Narekatsi, Grigor Magistros, Hovhannes Imastaser, Arakel Sjunetsi, etc."
10.24234/wisdom.v2i7.142,The Alliance Between Politics and Philosophy with Regard to the Threats of the XXI Century,"The alliance between politics and philosophy pursues the object to change the world as public or social life. The life implies various degrees of quality, and suggests existence regarded as a desirable condition: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This is the main point of the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776). We have here a whole philosophy of politics referring to Plato’s doctrine of the practical influence of philosophy on the state power to change the world (Plato, 1971, Rp. V 473d, VI 501e, VII 540d). The philosophy of politics holds life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to be unalienable rights and just so lays down the basic human rights as the principles of the political law, public law. The form of government which secures these rights is called democracy. America is no longer the ruler of her own spirit. In Armenia and Russia, there is instituted now timocracy, a form of government in which love of honor is the ruling principle (timē honor + krateein to rule). There exist here public law apart from human rights. The task of the philosophy of politics is to secure democracy in the United States of America and to carry out the transition from timocracy to democracy in the Republic of Armenia and the Russian Federation."
10.24234/wisdom.v2i7.140, Normative Contradictions in International Law: Implications for Legal Philosophy,"In order to be perceived as legitimate by those subject to it, a system of legal norms should be free of contradictions. The very idea of justice is incompatible with an erratic interpretation and, subsequently, arbitrary application of norms. Systemic contradictions make actions by state authorities unpredictable. However, at the domestic as well as at the international level, considerations of power and interest have often made of the respective body of norms a “hermeneutical minefield.” The international legal order in particular contains contradictions even between the most basic principles such as state sovereignty, self-determination and the rules of international humanitarian law. While, at the national level, the authority of constitutional courts may help to eliminate contradictions and inconsistencies, there exists, apart from limited regional arrangements, no such separation of powers at the international level. The lecture analyzes, inter alia, the systemic, destabilizing impact of normative contradictions in exemplary cases related to the interpretation of the United Nations Charter and draws conclusions in terms of the philosophy of law."

10.1017/byz.2016.32,Happiness after death? Demetrios Capetanakis on philosophy and Proust,"Demetrios Capetanakis was one of the first writers to introduce Marcel Proust to the Greek public in the 1930s. His study of Proust's philosophy (hitherto known only in the English and Greek translations of a lecture he delivered in French) survives in manuscript form, both in French and in an earlier German version. An examination of these texts in the context of Proust's early reception allows us to follow Capetanakis’ intellectual trajectory, as well as to sketch his particular joint approach to literature and philosophy, which is largely indebted to the works of Plato and Kierkegaard. Capetanakis seeks Proust's philosophy not in the universal laws put forth in his novel, but in the writer's attempt to conceal behind them the real pain and agony that marked his own life. This leads him to a rather unusual philosophical reading of Proust's novel and, in the process, of Plato's Phaedrus."

10.1515/mp-2017-0002,Towards a Naturalistic Philosophy,"AbstractThis paper is an invitation to reflect on the advisability of analysing philosophy from a naturalistic perspective. That is, from a perspective that considers philosophy as if it was one more cultural object, which can be studied using the tools that we have available to us today and that are provided by disciplines such as evolutionary psychology or anthropology oriented by a distinctly cognitivist approach. A central concept in the analysis is that of “intuitive ontology” – closely linked to intuitive (or folk-) philosophy or the spontaneous, naïve (natural) way of thinking that is associated with common sense – which is a result of the evolutionary process and a source of metaphysical prejudices such as dualism. A metaphilosophical reflection, such as that proposed here, identifies the “natural” character of a transcendent metaphysics that is still too close to intuitive philosophy, and the interest of constituting a naturalistic philosophy that is fully conscious of its “unnatural” or “counterintuitive” character."

Over the centuries, psyche has been the subject of discourse and contemplation, and of fable; it has also come to signify, in entomology, the order of Lepidoptera. In the current surge of research on brain and mind, there is a gradual transition from the psyche (or the “soul”) to the specified descriptors defined by the fields of Behavioral, Cognitive and Integrative Neuroscience."
10.22329/il.v26i2.441,Humanist Principles Underlying Philosophy of Argument,"This discussion reviews the thinking of some prominent philosophers of argument to extract principles common to their thinking. It shows that a growing concern with dialogical pragmatics is better appreciated as a part of applied ethics than of applied epistemology. The discussion concludes by indicating a possible consequence for philosophy of argument and invites further discussion by asking whether argumentation philosophy has an implicit, underlying moral, or even political, posture."
10.22329/il.v20i2.2264,The Place of Informal Logic in Philosophy,"We argue that informal logic is epistemological. Two central questions concern premise acceptability and connection adequacy. Both may be explicated in tenns of justification, a central epistemological concept. That some premises are basic parallels a foundationalist account of basic beliefs and epistemic support. Some epistemological accounts of these concepts may advance the analysis of premise acceptability and connection adequacy. Infonnallogic has implications for other aspects of philosophy. If causal interpretations are acceptable premises and thus justified, does the world have a causal structure? If evaluative premises are acceptable, i.e., justified, is value an objective feature of the world?"
10.22329/il.v20i2.2265,The Significance of Informal Logic for Philosophy,"Informal logic is a new sub-discipline of philosophy, roughly definable as the philosophy of argument. Contributors have challenged the traditional concept of an argument as a premiss-conclusion complex, in favour of speech-act, functional and dialogical conceptions; they have identified as additional components warrants, modal qualifiers, rebuttals, and a dialectical tier. They have objected that ""soundness"" is neither
necessary nor sufficient for a good argument. Alternative proposals include acceptability, relevance and sufficiency of the
premisses; conformity to a valid argument schema; conformity to rules for discussion aimed at rational resolution of a dispute. Informal logic is a significant part of philosophy."

I illustrate the thesis with his refutation ofthe claim that only ordinary language is correct. r discuss his three supporting arguments (historical, theoretical, and intermediate). And r criticize the thesis with the objections that if an ad hominem argument
is valid, it is really ad rem; that it's unclear how his own theoretical argument can be ad hominem; that if an ad hominem argument is really valid, it would have to be based on the proponent's own assumptions; and that the thesis is not true of philosophical arguments that are constructive rather than critical."

This project lead Johnstone into interesting confrontations with the concept of rhetoric and especiaUy with the work of Chaim Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca. The project culminated in a failed attempt to develop a formal ethics of rhetoric and argumentation, but this attempt was itself not consistent with some of Johnstone's other characterizations ofan ethics of argument ation. A virtue ethics would be truer to the Johnstonian philosophical project than a formal ethics of argument.

10.22329/il.v20i2.2263,Informal Logic and its Implications for Philosophy,I take 'informal logic' to be the (descriptive and normative) study of 'real arguments'-arguments which are or have been used with the aim of convincing others of a point of view. I argue that the informal logic tradition thus conceived (i) lends strong support to something like Quine's view that our beliefs really support one another like the filaments in a spider's web--and thus that the traditional view that implication is an asymmetric relation is false; (ii) suggests that the classic division of arguments into deductive and inductive has distorted our thinking about the evaluation of real arguments; and (iii) implies that naturalised epistemology is on the right track.
10.22329/il.v34i1.3869,John Stuart Mill's Philosophy of Persuasion,"In his youth, John Stuart Mill followed his father’s philosophy of persuasion but, in 1830, Mill adopted a new philosophy of persuasion, trying to lead people incrementally towards the truth from their original stand-points rather than engage them antagonistically.  Understanding this change helps us understand apparent contradictions in Mill’s cannon, as he disguises some of his more radical ideas in order to bring his audience to re-assess and authentically change their opinions.  It also suggests a way of re-assessing the relationship between Mill’s public and private works, to which we should look if we are attempting to understand his thought."
10.24260/alalbab.v5i2.395,Religion and the Spiritual Crisis of Modern Human Being in the Perspective of Huston Smith`S Perennial Philosophy,"This work is based on the assumption that modern human has undergone a multidimensional crisis. This crisis needs a timely response and an urgent solution, for if we neglect it, it will become worse and can destabilize the life of mankind globally. I refer to the work of Huston Smith on perennial philosophy to find its essence as an attempt to find solution for overcoming the modern men`s crisis. This is a library research using the philosophical hermeneutics method. The paper shows that, firstly, perennial philosophy has a characteristic of metaphysics, which try to find a fundamental basis for both immanent and transcendent of all things, psychology which depicts the common sameness in human and ethics as a goal in human life. Secondly, what is meant by human spiritual crisis is a condition where human neglected even destroyed the godhead character within themselves. Thirdly, the answer made by Huston smith`s Perennial Philosophy concerning human spiritual crisis include that the spiritual crisis of modern human being are seen from the tunnel metaphore, in which the basement is scientism, the left wall is education, media as the roof, and the right wall the law. The spiritual crisis of modern human being as a failure of post-modernism has a similiraty with modernism way of seeing this world as the only true reality, although there is different in approach between the two. Religious mysticism that was offered by Huston smith has a perenialistic tone. The pluralistic attitude found among humankind has to be rooted in an esoteric level within each religion. Smith`s perennial philosophy is very relevant to the condition of Indonesia, which therefore has sackeled by a rigid theological dogmatism. Religion should be an endeavor for human being to find a more exalted living."
10.5604/01.3001.0009.8001,Idea of solidarity in contemporary legal and political philosophy,"In contemporary philosophy of law and political philosophy, relatively little pace is devoted to the problem of solidarity. In Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence and political philosophy, this concept barely makes an appearance. In the relevant European literature, including that in Polish, references usually have a historical focus, and deal with the sociological concepts of Emil Durkheim (the division into mechanical and organic solidarity) and Ferdinand Tönnies (the distinction of Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft), and their legal application by Leon Duguit (socialization of law as an expression of social soldarization). But if solidarity appears in contemporary philosophical-legal analyses, this is most frequently not expressis verbis, but in a manner that is concealed in one way or another by justice, especially in considerations of broadly conceived social justice.

In performing original contemporary composition, I celebrate the accomplishments of Te Aitu o Te Rangi, a Tuawahine, and I recall and embody the power of my matrilineal genealogy. Mana wahine stands strong in the spaces where feminist discourse continues to dominate, and composition provides a platform on which to reclaim and rewrite difference. My paper will look at the medium of contemporary music to provoke recognition and critique of the western archetype of the heroine, whilst at the same time advocating for social change."

The research recognize that there are still many weaknesses that need to be changed in the education system of the pondok, so that they continue to stand and live to provide the religious spirit to every Muslim as has been proved before. Yet these benefits outweigh the weaknesses. It should not be repealed. It is important to find new formulas to empower this institution in line with the changes in time. It is something which has been proven to be good and useful to mankind, so there is no need to bother to change it. Although there are wooden frames and a roof that need to be replaced, and water wells that should be constructed to ensure the water flows, but again there is no need to destroy what has been strongly built. The good values of each item are fixed. It is also the role of pondok education in religious education that has played an effective role in order to form a noble personality and civilized humans in accordance with the Islamic principles."
10.1515/apeiron-2016-0049,Lunar Composition and Lunar Light in Stoic Philosophy,"AbstractThis paper attempts to reconstruct the Stoics’ theory (or theories) of the nature of the moon and its illumination from the fragmentary, and sometimes apparently conflicting, evidence. It reveals how the Stoics accounted for the distinctive characteristics of the moon by intricately utilising their mixture theory (especially κρᾶσις) and their elemental theory in their doctrines of the moon’s composition and the moon’s illumination. The evidence, I conclude, points to a singular, complex Stoic theory, one according to which the moon does not (as scholars have commonly supposed) have any light of its own. The details of this theory additionally furnish important new insights into the Stoic doctrines of κρᾶσις and πνεῦμα."

10.24908/pceea.v0i0.4849,TRANSLATING A CORPORATE LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICE TO THE ENGINEERING CLASSROOM,"A multi-billion dollar chemical company (DupontCanada) developed, over twenty years, a unique leadership philosophy and practice that was instrumental in the company’s remarkable improvement and great financial and societal success. The beliefs that are fundamental to this Developmental Leadership model are: values are the foundation of leadership; everyone can learn to lead; leaders develop role model leading competence through learning certain skills, character attributes and purposeful behaviours; the work of leaders in organizations is developing high performance work systems dedicated to achieving sustainable growth; and learning to be a better leader is a life-long endeavor. A leadership course for engineering students based on this was developed by the former CEO and Chairman of the company (first author David Colcleugh), an engineer by training, and has been offered to undergraduate and post-graduate engineering students at the University of Toronto since 2007. At first the course was offered as a combined undergraduate-graduate course. In 2011 it was decided to offer separate coursesfor graduate students and undergraduate students. Atextbook,  Everyone a Leader, was prepared (byColceugh) and beginning in 2012 was used, in manuscript form, in both courses. The textbook provided the curriculum and instructional framework that permitted a second instructor to lead the course –(second author Doug Reeve). The Developmental Leadership Model serves as a framework for instruction so long as the instructor’s own leadership experience is well integrated into course discussions. The course hasnow been offered eight times.The motivation for the course arises from the belief that engineering students should, in addition to having strong scientific and technical capabilities and being self-motivated to contribute, should be well prepared emotionally, socially, and ethically to accept challenges and should be to committed to develop non-technical as well as technical competencies."

We begin by first considering what ethics is and why it’s important. This is then followed with examples that demonstrate questionable ethical and moral behaviour from both research and professional practice. We deliberately draw in both as the outputs of research also inform the corporate world, the activities of which affect society as a whole. Following this we introduce a selection of key moral philosophies and their application to academic and professional practice within accounting and finance. The chapter includes examples of important issues that require careful reflections and consideration when determining approaches to data gathering and ensuring professional integrity. Finally, some practical advice and the fundamental principles of good research conduct and codes of ethics are put forward."

It is therefore good practice to outline the philosophical orientation of your research and this requires that you address the particular relationship between ontology, epistemology, methodology, data gathering techniques and data analysis approaches.  This chapter sets out definitions of these five key concepts, shows how they inter-relate and reviews common configurations in management and organizational research. Further, the chapter introduces the Method Map as a means of presenting a succinct, yet comprehensive account of the paradigm within which your research is conducted. In so doing, the chapter offers a clear, structured and explicit means of dealing with the philosophy of knowledge."
10.1075/tis.12.1.06haw,Differential translation,"Translators of German philosophy into English must often choose whether to express concrete or abstract meanings for polysemous German keywords. This article discusses “differential translation,” a widely underestimated strategy for representing polysemous words in translation. Disavowing both untranslatability and the necessity of terminological equivalence, this strategy integrates signs of polysemy into the reading experience by presenting foreign keywords in brackets after their differing, context-dependent meanings. The article discusses how translators have already responded and how they might respond even more constructively to passages where Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Hans Blumenberg, respectively, choose words that link abstractions to images: by presenting existence as both foundational and ground-like (gründlich), time as both fluctuating and fluid (strömend), and common sense as both obvious and nearby (naheliegend). Encountering differentially translated texts would challenge future scholars to evaluate the unity of the concepts behind the words."

There are problems in his essential theses: Recognizing alterity is recognizing wants and needs. These are said to be unending, infinite. The wholly Other—God—is constitutive of the alterity of the other human. Ethics originates in Jewish religious history. Ethical absoluteness conflicts with political responsibility."
10.22329/p.v7i1.3366,Politics: The Highest Form of Philosophy?,"According to Hannah Arendt, action is the only activity that goes on directly between men without the intermediary of things or matter. From this point of view, action is the basis of political life. But, although human actions are direct human interactions, each person must have a body and senses, a sensation of reality and a feeling of realness—and do we not share these characteristics with animals? Therefore, do we have the right to claim that human interaction and consciousness of an acting self are uniquely, humanly political? For example, what if we were to maintain that language is a second-order conventionalization of the expressive body immersed in an atmosphere, assimilating and being assimilated. If this were to be the case, how then can we explain the passage from elemental life, the life we share with all living things, to the acting in and among human pluralities that Hannah Arendt identifies with the political? Kant tried to do this by separating reason from sensation and separating respect from nature’s purely physical, causal forces. This essay examines Arendt’s claim that it is uniquely the activity that passes between humans that makes it possible for humans to consider themselves political."
10.22329/p.v9i1.4064,The Primary Silence of the Past and the Weakness of Philosophy,"In light of more contemporary interest in the concept of an immemorial past, this essay takes up the manner in which this idea figures in Merleau-Ponty’s works by turning to the famous reference to “a past that has never been present” in Phenomenology of Perception. In order to contextualize and think through what Merleau-Ponty means, I turn to a reference in the same text to “primary silence.” Merleau-Ponty’s concern is to disclose the differential between the concatenation of sensibility and expression and what remains beyond the bounds of the sensible. The task of phenomenology, accordingly, is the disclosure of this primary silence, this primary non-sense. Finally, articulating that this differential never ceased to be a concern for Merleau-Ponty, and, turning to texts from the 1950s as well as to The Visible and the Invisible, we see the development of Merleau-Ponty’s thought as the consistent effort to think through this question.  "
10.1515/opth-2017-0013,Thought Experiments in Philosophy of Religion: The Virtues of Phenomenological Realism and Values,AbstractWe present a criterion for the use of thought experiments as a guide to possibilia that bear on important arguments in philosophy of religion. We propose that the more successful thought experiments are closer to the world in terms of phenomenological realism and the values they are intended to track. This proposal is filled out by comparing thought experiments of life after death by Peter van Inwagen and Dean Zimmerman with an idealist thought experiment. In terms of realism and values we contrast an exemplary thought experiment by Iris Murdoch with one we find problematic by William Irwin.
10.20360/g2b60n,“I am no Othello. I am a lie”: A Consideration of Reader-Response Theory as Language Learning Pedagogy and Teacher Philosophy,"This paper seeks to articulate the understanding of transactional/reader-response as theory and its use in the language classroom as both teaching philosophy and pedagogy. First, I map the terrain of reader-response theory, its history, in general, and how it has been articulated in literary studies, in particular. Next, I briefly synthesise studies that sought to empirically study reader response in the classroom and question why these inevitably fail to engage meaningfully with it - and seem to instead only result in teacher “lesson plan” ideas. I offer a case study of a language student’s responses to the novel Season of Migration to the North (Salih, 2009) to argue that reader-response should be central to teaching philosophies that hope to centre learners in inclusive educational processes."
10.4102/ve.v31i1.428,A critical assessment of Anton Szandor LaVeys Philosophy of Indulgence as a dogma based assault on Scripture,"The aim of this article has been to critically assess and unmask Anton Szandor LaVey�s Philosophy of Indulgence reflected in The Satanic Bible (1969) as a dogma based assault on Scripture. The main task of this article has been to expose some contemporary ethical and dogmatic utterances used to express disagreements which LaVey alludes to in The Satanic Bible against Scripture. The debate in which these disagreements are expressed is their interminable character of the concept of what defines human morality. The philosophy under review has been assessed according to its effects on humanity. Does it create a just world and a set of values in the same way Scripture does or does it create unity of purpose or divergent views that put the world and the church on crossroads? The conclusion of this work posits a challenge towards evaluating the theology of nature, which now appears to be the main theological framework of the 21st century debate."

Practical Philosophy,"Though Aristotle focused mainly on the theoretical sciences, the Politics and the Nicomachean Ethics belong to the practical branch of philosophy. These are practical in that they aim not merely to purvey truth but also to affect action. Their themes are êthika (matters connected with character), arête (excellence), and eudaimonia (success). ‘Practical Philosophy’ points out that no one can be said to flourish as a human being unless exercising distinctively human faculties. Aristotle is not asking what makes us happy, and he is not concerned with how we should lead our lives, in a moral sense. He wants to instruct us in how to make a success of our lives."

It considers the theories of the Polish-born anthropologist Paul Radin (1883–1959), the German-born philosopher Ernst Cassirer (1874–1945), the German theologian Rudolf Bultmann (1884–1976), the German-born philosopher Hans Jonas (1903–93), and the French existentialist writer Albert Camus (1913–60)."

Very few people—philosophers and non-philosophers alike—do know much about this period of philosophy, but since it is now clear that there was a great deal of excellent philosophy written in the Middle Ages, is there not as much reason to learn about it as to learn about excellent philosophy from any other period? Medieval philosophy shows that the history of philosophy cannot be understood apart from the history of religions, not just because this is true for the time it covers, but because it points to how philosophy and religion were intertwined before then, and for long afterwards."

Fields of medieval philosophy,"‘Fields of medieval philosophy’ considers how logic, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of religion were treated in medieval philosophy’s four traditions. Logic was considered valuable in itself, and was studied with great technical sophistication and used as a tool throughout philosophy, where it set the form of discussion. Arabic and Latin logic developed into parallel traditions although both were based on Aristotle’s logical texts. Aristotle’s key texts—Metaphysics, On Interpretation, On the Soul, and Nicomachean Ethics—were central to all four traditions. They encouraged thinking that tied together philosophy of mind and philosophy of language; were fundamental for investigating perception, memory, and reasoning; and were central to moral philosophy."

A map of later medieval philosophy,"‘A map of later medieval philosophy’ charts the development of medieval philosophy from the year 1200, which marks an important break across all four traditions, to the 17th century. Latin philosophy was transformed in the 13th century by the rise of the universities of Paris and Oxford. After Maimonides died in 1204, Jewish philosophy (previously written in Arabic) flourished among Jews living in Christian Europe writing in Hebrew. Also in 1204, the Crusaders took Constantinople, and Byzantine philosophy became heavily influenced by Latin writing. Averroes’ death in 1198 marked the end of the falsafa tradition. Philosophy continued to flourish in the Islamic East, but in a form that linked it much more closely to theology."

A map of earlier medieval philosophy,"‘A map of earlier medieval philosophy’ outlines the development of medieval philosophy in its different traditions beginning with the Platonic schools of late antiquity. The five originators of the medieval traditions were Augustine, Boethius, ‘pseudo-Dionysius’, John Philoponus, and Sergius of Resh‘aynā. The most powerful 7th-century philosopher in Byzantium was Maximus the Confessor. In the West, key thinkers included Alcuin and Anselm. The beginnings of Arabic philosophy—kalām and falsafa—and their exponents, including al-Kindī and Avicenna, are then discussed before moving on to Peter Abelard and his 12th-century Latin philosophy, and Muslim and Jewish philosophy in the Islamic West with Averroes and Maimonides."

The example of comparison of Judaic and Christian tradition shows the various focuses of understanding of a belief’s phenomenon in its interface to texts of the Old and New Testament, Christian exegesis and views of prominent foreign and domestic philosophers (M. Buber, P. Tillikh, H. Yannaras, D. Zilberman, M. Bakhtin)."

Kolman’s paper, “The Tasks of Contemporary Philosophy in the Struggle for New Humanism”, aroused a vitriolic rejoinder by Russell. However, the text of the paper as published in the congress Proceedings has a conciliatory tone. This version could not have aroused such a reaction. There is, however, an article, with a similar title, published in Czech in 1948, stating that this is Kolman’s paper from the congress. I argue that this article more likely reflects what Kolman actually said at the Congress. Finally, I provide an English translation of this article."

10.1093/oso/9780198779650.003.0002,Philosophy as Philosophical Anthropology,"Herder’s early philosophy is widely seen as a project of destroying metaphysics and replacing it with anthropology. Through an analysis of two early texts, this chapter investigates the relationship of metaphysics and anthropology in the early Herder. It explains his attempt to in fact transform, and not destroy, metaphysics such that psychology, and no longer ontology, becomes the foundational discipline in philosophy. Metaphysics still possesses priority over anthropology, but only on condition that metaphysics be revised into a form of psychology that provides the basic concept of the human being and from which are to be borrowed the principles for a new philosophy of the education of the people. Only through reflection on the whole human being and on the cultural and historical ways of its realization can the deficiencies of philosophy be named and plans for its improvement worked out."
10.1093/oso/9780198779650.003.0012,Individualism and Universalism in Herder’s Conception of the Philosophy of History,"Herder was very familiar with the concept of human rights (in his German, “Menschenrechte”), strongly shared the moral ideals of protecting people at which the concept aims, but tended to avoid using the concept himself. Why this ambivalence? The present article argues that a number of well-founded concerns about the concept underlie, or at least may underlie, his reservation, including concerns about the legal rather than moral nature of the very concept of “rights,” the undue restriction of the focus of “human rights” to protecting people against threats that emanate from their own governments rather than against those from outside (imperialism, colonialism, etc.) as well, and the concept’s dubious restriction of protections to human beings to the exclusion of animals. The article also argues, however, that these concerns are not insurmountable, and that indeed Herder himself has provided some of the most important theoretical tools for surmounting them."

10.1515/witt-2017-001,Solipsism – The Leitmotif in Wittgenstein’s Life and Philosophy,"AbstractThis paper will highlight the close relationship between Wittgenstein’s life and train of thought, using his treatment of solipsism as an example. The intensity with which Wittgenstein explored this theme hints towards an existential and cultural background that is further developed in a comparison of his works with the entries in his diaries. The treatment of solipsism will be presented as an expression of an inner wrestling for the correct view of world and life. The transition from early to late philosophical thought is paired with a revised understanding of the concept of a felicitous life, which in turn is reflected in an altered understanding of language. The replacement of an analysis of the general form of propositions by the description of language games and the departure from logical forms towards forms of life - from a practical point of view - corresponds with a new approach to overcoming alienation.For a systematic assessment of Wittgenstein’s initial espousal of solipsism (in the Tractatus) and his later criticism (in the Philosophical Investigations), the various types of solipsism, which Wittgenstein used as benchmarks, will be taken into consideration, in particular, Weininger’s ethical solipsism, Schopenhauer’s contemplative aesthetic solipsism as well as Descartes’ methodological solipsism."
10.11114/ijecs.v1i1.3227,The Philosophy of Sport as Artistic Expression,"While there is no “expressive theory of sport”, there is certainly, according to Hyland (1984, 1990), Osterhoudt (1973), Kerr (1997) and Weis (1969) a pivotal role played by emotions and feelings in sport which amount to a type of expressive theory and in that sense it parallels expressive theories in art. In this article I will first isolate three moments that capture sports performance and parallel art. Then, I will describe sport as an expression of emotional release, which is often how one understands art. Based on such overlaps, I will argue for two philosophical observations that devolve from such a comparison, namely ineffability and the unity of mind-body (in sport). Finally, I will apply a reading of Kant to sport, in order to substantiate the idea that sport, like art draws from a philosophical heritage.Imagine three isolated “steps” in sport: the focus before performance; the performance itself and the fan’s response as they articulate the emotional basis of sport which is familiar, albeit perhaps subconscious. After a brief analysis of these imagined images, I give a simplified historical outline of sport which describes the feeling-basis of play that forms the foundation for modern sport. I then examine what I have termed the “(surplus) expressive-energy theory of sport” which I have gleaned from the above writers, a theory that argues that sport is the expression of inner emotional states. Such states are in need of expiation of both the practitioner as well as the expression of certain basic emotions on the part of the audience. A narrower version of this theory is that sport is the release of aggressiveness, which coheres with its instinctual origins and the “surplus theory”. A critique of sport as expression (of surplus energy, aggression…) follows with a view to highlight some shortcomings in the ideas presented and thus the need for further theories to account for the multi-faceted nature of sport, a similar requirement that is needed for art given the shortcomings of expressive theories as applied to the arts."
10.15210/dissertatio.v0i0.11012,BERGSON’S REFORMATION OF PHILOSOPHY,"Neste artigo sigo uma sugestão de Pierre Hadot pela qual ele, desde que era um jovem estudante, entendia que “o bergsonismo não era uma filosofia abstrata e conceptual, mas uma nova maneira de ver a si e ao mundo”. A Filosofia para Bergson possui assim dois objetivos principais: (i) ampliar a percepção humana; (ii) aprimorar a capacidade humana de agir e de viver. Examino alguns aspectos centrais da reforma bergsoniana da Filosofia, cuja ambição é levar a Filosofia além da academia, inclusive das disputas entre diferentes escolas filosóficas. O novo conhecimento que assim obtivermos nos possibilitará duas coisas: aprimorará a especulação filosófica – o que contribui para uma ampliação de nossa percepção -, estimulará e iluminará a vida cotidiana, inclusive aprimorando a nossa capacidade de agir e de viver."

Um caso típico é o da Filosofia Experimental, um campo emergente que faz uso de dados empíricos colhido por meio de inquéritos seguindo os mesmos métodos empregados nas ciências empíricas, nomeadamente na psicologia, a fim de apresentar provas em pesquisas ou argumentos filosóficos. Outro exemplo é oferecido pela participação ativa dos filósofos em grupos de pesquisa interdisciplinares nas neurociências. No entanto, os filósofos não são especialistas em metodologia de pesquisa empírica. Isso é transparente nos estudos mais representativos em filosofia experimental. Neste artigo, faremos algumas observações de advertência sobre as complexidades da metodologia das ciências empíricas. A recomendação final é de que é sábia a atitude de envolver-se em grupos de pesquisa interdisciplinares, buscando dominar as peculiaridades dos mais diversos delineamentos de pesquisa empírica nas diferentes áreas da ciência."
10.21913/jps.v5i1.1481,On the distinctive educational value of philosophy,"Should philosophy be a compulsory subject in schools? I take it as read that philosophy has general educational value: like other academic disciplines, it cultivates a range of intellectual virtues in those who study it. But that may not be a good enough reason to add it to the roster of established school subjects. The claim I defend in this article is that philosophy also has distinctive educational value: there are philosophical problems that feature prominently and pressingly in ordinary human lives and that all children should be equipped by their education to tackle. Among these are the problems of justifying subscription to moral, political and religious standards. The significance of these problems for everyone is sufficient to warrant the inclusion of philosophy in the school curriculum."
10.21913/jps.v5i1.1482,Philosophy and the good life,"This paper considers the implications for education of a reworked ancient Greek ethics and politics of flourishing (particularly as found in Plato), where ‘flourishing’ comprises the objective actualisation of our intellectual, imaginative and affective potential. A brief outline of the main features of an ethics of flourishing and its potential attractions as an ethical framework is followed by a consideration of the ethical, aesthetic and political requirements of such a framework for the theory and practice of education, indicating the ways in which my approach differs from other recent work in the field. I argue that the teaching of philosophy in schools and philosophical approaches to the teaching of other subjects are ideally suited to meet the pedagogic requirements of individual and communal flourishing so understood, contributing greatly both to the understanding of what a well-lived life might be, and to the actual living of it. I further argue that these requirements are not only derived from ancient Greek philosophy but are in turn especially well-served by the teaching and deployment of Greek philosophy itself. My claim is not that Greek philosophy has all the answers, or that other philosophers and philosophical approaches should be excluded; it is simply that Greek philosophy offers rich resources for those seeking to introduce children and young people to philosophy and to foster thereby their flourishing in both childhood and as adults."
10.7575/aiac.alls.v.9n.2p.138,Religious Pluralism in Yan Martel’s Life of Pi: A Case of Intertextual           Correspondence with Swami Vivekananda’s Religious Philosophy,"Yan Martel’s Life of Pi – the story as well as its religious ideology—exhibits apparent intertextual correspondence with the concept of “Universalism” the Indian mystic Swami Vivekananda preached to the world more than a century ago. Martel’s central character Pi represents this concept of religion, which finds the same set of universally valid principles in all religions of the world, and thus embraces all religions with the willingness to worship God in all places of worship, irrespective of whether they belong to Islam or Christianity or Buddhism or Hinduism. This perception of religiousness of Life of Pi comes as a solution to the concerns of the present religiously divided, material and greedy world that speaks a lot in vain about ecumenism, interfaith and constructive interaction among religions. The story of the shipwreck with the horrible experiences of Pi in the lifeboat  in the presence of  the Indian tiger Richard Parker and his  eventual survival validates this concept of God and works out a formula for a harmonious coexistence of religions and other conflicting forces in the world. Thus the book becomes a great religious allegory in tune with the fundamentals of all religious traditions: a pilgrimage on the sea of Karma to be united with the Absolute, a metaphor of the Atman seeking to realize Brahman, and an allegory on the concept of retributive justice of God by which sins are punished and virtues rewarded. "
10.1017/s0012217317000956,Against a Sequestered Philosophy,"This paper argues that philosophical practice in the Western world, in particular analytic philosophy, suffers from problems that contribute to its lack of diversity in two senses: the exclusion of women and minorities, and a narrow choice of subjects and methods. This is not fruitful for philosophical exchange and the flourishing of philosophical thought. Three contributing factors are covered: a flawed execution when instilling intellectual humility; the gaslighting of women in philosophy; and an overemphasis on a narrow conception of intelligence. The conclusion calls for a more humane and socially aware practice of philosophy."
10.1017/s0012217317000907,Why the ‘Politics’ against African Philosophy should be Discontinued,"We argue that philosophy education across the globe is still bedevilled with the ‘politics’ of marginalization of less favoured traditions like African philosophy. Extant works show that the conventional curriculum of philosophy used in educational institutions across the globe is predominantly Western and, as such, very much colonial. We contend that this amounts to a sort of ‘epistemic injustice’ that is detrimental to knowledge production. We argue specifically that this ‘politics’ should be discontinued. We propose the conversational tradition, out of which a philosophy curriculum that is comprehensive and antithetical to the politics of exclusion may be developed."
10.1017/s0012217317000634,Is Asking What Women Want the Right Question? Underrepresentation in Philosophy and Gender Differences in Interests,"In discussions of the underrepresentation of women in professional philosophy, those sceptical of discrimination as an explanation often suggest that gender differences in interests are a plausible alternative hypothesis. Some suspect that if women’s differing interests explains underrepresentation, then interventions suggested by the discrimination hypothesis might be unnecessary—or even risky. I argue that one needs to consider how stereotypes might influence interests, and that doing so can provide a more even-handed assessment of the risks involved in proposed interventions."
10.1017/s0012217318000021,The Dimensions of Diversity: Teaching Non-Western Works in Introductory Philosophy Courses,"The recent push to diversify philosophy courses is often motivated by a desire to include underrepresented students. Although incorporating non-Western philosophy would achieve greater diversity, there seems to be no special reason to select non-Western traditions for this purpose. I argue this appearance is deceiving. Data suggests an absence of non-Western content in the curriculum causes alienation for some of our students of colour. Given the minimal burden it would impose on philosophy instructors to address this suffering, we have good reason to include some non-Western content in our introductory courses, where it is likely to have the greatest impact."
10.1017/s0034670517001103,"What Is First Philosophy? An Appreciation of Catherine Zuckert, Postmodern Platos","AbstractCatherine Zuckert’s Postmodern Platos is built around Leo Strauss’s complex response to Martin Heidegger’s vision of the prephilosophic starting points of philosophy, his phenomenology of human existence. Zuckert accepts too much of this spare phenomenology, and so gives too bleak an account of what philosophy can be. A richer account is available in Plato’s Phaedrus, and is even intimated at crucial points of Strauss’s own writings. The cheerful “first philosophy” built on this erotic phenomenology is truer than Heideggerian bleakness to where philosophy begins in practice, as much for Zuckert as for Strauss and Heidegger: in the experience of the eros of the conversation between teacher and student."
10.1093/oso/9780198810384.003.0002,The Duty of Philosophy,"This chapter concerns the nature of metaphysics and a defense of it through a clarification of what role it plays in our theorizing of the world. It is argued that metaphysics and science are on the same continuum and that therefore the same empirical methods apply to metaphysics and the sciences. The ontology/cosmology distinction and the analytic/speculative distinction are introduced and explained. Ontology is the study of being as such and is concerned with general features of every existent, whereas cosmology is the study of how every existent is related to every other in general terms. Analytic inquiry concerns the nature of something and is therefore deductive, whereas speculative inquiry concerns why certain things come into being and is therefore inductive. Both distinctions are distinct. The resulting proposal is that metaphysics has two branches: ontology and cosmology, and either branch can be investigated analytically or speculatively."
10.1093/oso/9780198811251.003.0003,Moore’s Early Philosophy,This chapter explains and develops a sense of the intellectual momentum that drove G.E. Moore from Kantianism to his New Philosophy. The chapter begins by describing the movement of thought that began with Moore’s 1898 Fellowship dissertation and the enduring lines of criticism of Kant’s Copernican Revolution subsequently developed in ‘The Refutation of Idealism’ (1903) and other writings. Next the chapter lays out the conceptual realism of Moore’s ‘The Nature of Judgment’ (1899). Moore recapitulated Hegel’s critique of Kant and advanced the doctrine that the world itself is thinkable—that cognition is possible because reality is itself a sea of information.
10.1093/oso/9780198811251.003.0005,Russell’s Early Philosophy,"This chapter shows how Russell’s ontological outlook in the late nineteenth century developed from an essentially Kantian starting point to one influenced by the categorial monism of G.E. Moore’s New Philosophy. To do so, this chapter investigates two texts, unduly neglected by Russell commentators. First, the chapter explores Russell’s 1989 manuscript An Analysis of Mathematical Reasoning, which predates the inception of the New Philosophy, in which Russell still distinguished substance and attribute as Kant did. Then this chapter develops a novel interpretation of Russell’s 1900 The Philosophy of Leibniz, an interpretation according to which the distinction between substance and attribute is superseded."

Humane Governance is a critical core value in East Asian Confucian political thought. It examines the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Confucians’ discourses on Humane Governance, employing analyses of their political thoughts and the theoretical dilemmas embedded therein. It reaches a critical conclusion that Confucian ethic remains largely internal and does not develop clear lines of external accountability. At the same time this ethic is at a personal level very demanding in terms of the concern rulers should display towards the governed."

10.21913/jps.v5i1.1483,The need for philosophy in promoting democracy: A case for philosophy in the curriculum,"The studies by Trickey and Topping, which provide empirical support that philosophy produces cognitive gains and social benefits, have been used to advocate the view that philosophy deserves a place in the curriculum. Arguably, the existing curriculum, built around well-established core subjects, already provides what philosophy is said to do, and, therefore, there is no case to be made for expanding it to include philosophy. However, if we take citizenship education seriously, then the development of active and informed citizens requires an emphasis on citizen preparation, but significantly more than the existing curriculum can provide, namely, the acquisition of knowledge and skills to improve students’ social and intellectual capacities and dispositions as future citizens. To this end, I argue for a model of democratic education that emphasises philosophy functioning educationally, whereby students have an integral role to play in shaping democracy through engaging in philosophy as collaborative inquiry that integrates pedagogy, curriculum and assessment. I contend that only philosophy can promote democracy, insofar as philosophical inquiry is an exemplar of the kind of deliberative inquiry required for informed and active democratic citizenship. In this way, philosophy can make a fundamental and much needed contribution to education."
10.21913/jps.v5i1.1485,The Generic Argument for teaching philosophy,"John Dewey wished to place development of the ability to think at the core of school education. The kind of thinking that Dewey had in mind was based on his conception of scientific inquiry. Matthew Lipman was likewise committed to an education centred on thinking, but he claimed that we should turn to philosophy rather than to science in order to secure this end. In his view, philosophy has a stronger claim to this mantle than does science, or any other subject, when it is appropriately reconstructed and taught. He developed various arguments to that effect, but the one considered here is that philosophical thinking has a generic character that especially suits it for the role. I examine this argument to see how compelling a case it makes for the inclusion of philosophy in the school curriculum."
10.21913/jps.v5i1.1486,"Plato, metacognition and philosophy in schools","In this article, I begin by saying something about what metacognition is and why it is desirable within education. I then outline how Plato anticipates this concept in his dialogue Meno. This is not just a historical point; by dividing the cognitive self into a three-in-one—a ‘learner’, a ‘teacher’ and an ‘evaluator’—Plato affords us a neat metaphorical framework for understanding metacognition that, I contend, is valuable today. In addition to aiding our understanding of this concept, Plato’s model of metacognition not only provides us with a practical, pedagogical method for developing a metacognitive attitude, but also for doing so through doing philosophy. I conclude by making a case for philosophy’s inclusion in our school systems by appeal to those aspects of philosophy (the conceptual, the self-consciousness and the epistemological) that are metacognitive or that are conducive to developing metacognition, as revealed by the insights afforded us by Plato’s Meno and Theaetetus."
10.21913/jps.v5i1.1488,Deep thinking and high ceilings: Using philosophy to challenge ‘more able’ pupils,"At different times in their school career and across different subject areas, some pupils may require additional and/or more complex tasks from their teachers, since they find the work set to be insufficiently challenging. Recommendations for coping with these pupils’ needs are varied, but among other responses, it is common, in the field of ‘gifted and talented’ education, to advocate the use of critical thinking programmes. These can be very effective in providing the missing challenge through helping develop pupils’ facilities for building and defending rational argument. However, the exercises can be just that; mental agility tasks that lack relevant context. When children engage in learning philosophy in school, they benefit from the experience of developing logical, rigorous argument; but the subject can offer more than critical skills practice. Since philosophy attends to questions about things that matter in pupils’ lives, discussions can have an ethical and moral dimension and as such can be more than an intellectual exercise. Pupils of all abilities and propensities can become involved in the discussions, but the open nature of the areas of debate lends itself particularly well to providing challenge for pupils who need enriched and extended tasks in order to remain engaged. Some of the well-rehearsed Philosophy with/for Children methods are also designed to help develop mutual respect and understanding and so philosophy not only appeals to the cognitive and intellectual in children, but places this development in a context that fosters positive personal qualities."

Such comparative study is very important for political&lt;br /&gt;thought in general. The main significance of this paper is the precise meaning of the political philosophy&lt;br /&gt;of Plato and political philosophy of Aristotle, as well as the meaning of differences and similarities.&lt;br /&gt;Often, Plato’s political ideas appear as Aristotle political ideas, and Aristotle’s political ideas appear as&lt;br /&gt;Plato’s political ideas. The main method of study in this paper is the comparison method.

The data for paper are taken from the books of these two authors. The&lt;br /&gt;political philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, although they have similarities in some points, but differ in&lt;br /&gt;many other issues, such as: different categories of political analysis, different methodologies of policy&lt;br /&gt;study, and different reasons for state creation, different opinions why democracy is a bad form of&lt;br /&gt;government and why aristocracy is the right form.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;"

Reflections on Slavoj Žižek’s Version of Dialectical Philosophy in ""Absolute Recoil: Towards a New Foundation of Dialectical Materialism"".","Slavoj Žižek shows in his book Absolute Recoil (and previous Hegelian works such as Less than Nothing) the importance of repeating Hegel’s dialectical philosophy in contemporary capitalism. Žižek contributes especially to a reconceptualisation of dialectical logic and based on it the dialectic of history. The reflections in this paper stress that the dialectic is only the absolute recoil, a sublation that posits its own presuppositions, by working as a living fire that extinguishes and kindles itself. I point out that a new foundation of dialectical materialism needs a proper Heraclitusian foundation. I discuss Žižek’s version of the dialectic that stresses the absolute recoil and the logic of retroactivity and point out its implications for the concept of history as well as Žižek’s own theoretical ambiguities that oscillate between postmodern relativism and mechanical materialism. I argue that Žižek’s version of the dialectic should be brought into a dialogue with the dialectical philosophies of the German Marxists Hans Heinz Holz and Herbert Hörz. Žižek’s achievement is that he helps keeping alive the fire of dialectical materialism in the 21st century. Such a dialectical fire is needed for a proper revolutionary theory."
10.31269/triplec.v13i1.650,"Martin Heidegger’s Anti-Semitism: Philosophy of Technology and the Media in the Light of the ""Black Notebooks"". Implications for the Reception of Heidegger in Media and Communication Studies","“Heidegger is the petty bourgeois of German philosophy, the man who has placed on German philosophy his kitschy night-cap […] When I see that even super-intelligent people have been taken in by Heidegger, […] I feel sickened to this day. […] Heidegger used to hold court at Todtnauberg and at all times would allow himself to be admired on his philosophical Black Forest plinth like a sacred cow. […] They made their pilgramages, as it were, into the philosophical Black Forest, to the sacred Martin Heidegger and knelt down before their idol”--- Thomas BernhardAbstract:In spring 2014, three volumes of the Schwarze Hefte (Black Notebooks), Heidegger’s philosophical notebooks, were published in the German edition of his collected works. They contain notes taken in the years 1931-1941 and have resulted in public debates about the role of anti-Semitism in Heidegger’s thought.This article asks: What are and should be the implications of the publication of the Black Notebooks for the reception of Heidegger in the study, theory, and philosophy of media, communication, and technology? It discusses Theodor W. Adorno’s and Moishe Postone’s contributions to the critical theory of anti-Semitism and applies these approaches for an analysis of Heidegger’s Black Notebooks.The analysis shows that the logic of modern technology plays an important role in the Black Notebooks. The paper therefore also re-visits some of Heidegger’s writings on technology in light of the Black Notebooks. There is a logical link between the Black Notebooks' anti-Semitism and the analysis of technology in Being and Time and The Question Concerning Technology. The first publication provides the missing link and grounding for the second and the third.Heidegger’s works have had significant influence on studies of the media, communication, and the Internet. Given the anti-Semitism in the Black Notebooks, it is time that Heideggerians abandon Heidegger, and instead focus on  alternative traditions of thought. It is now also the moment where scholars should consider stopping to eulogise and reference Heidegger when theorising and analysing the media, communication, culture, technology, digital media, and the Internet.Image source:  By Willy Pragher (Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg)  [CC BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons"

10.2307/972084,Returning to the Source: Social Archaeology as Latin American Philosophy,"The following article proposes reconsidering the social archaeology paradigm as a worthwhile school of thought within Latin American philosophy. Rather than critiquing social archaeology for its supposed methodological limitations, I argue that this Latin American approach has already had an enormous contribution to the anthropological and political thought of the region. Instead of assuming that archaeology is a neutral enterprise, social archaeologists and others influenced by their ideas have already carried out important interdisciplinary and socially relevant research in the historical understanding of the past. Archaeological sites such as those of Cochasquí and Agua Blanca (among others) in Ecuador have benefitted significantly from a more refined political analysis of their histories than those routinely carried out in the positivistic paradigm of the United States. Finally, social archaeology also points to a much needed and useful link between the committed assessment of the continent""s past with the varied and important political transformation essential for the future well being of Latin America’s people."
10.2307/1159010,The concept of spirit in Akwapim Akan philosophy,"Opening ParagraphStudies of African religions almost invariably include detailed discussions of various categories of spirits. Rarely, however, is spirit considered in the abstract; spirits are described, but not the spiritual. This paper will explore the concept ofsunsum, ‘spirit’, as it is employed throughout Akwapim Akan philosophy.Sunsumwill be shown to be the central, unifying theme which integrates the various domains of Akwapim Akan thought. The distinction between the exclusively spiritual (ye sunsum) and the inspirited (wo sunsum) figures prominently in the ontology, epistemology and theory of causality and constitutes a major premise of the philosophy. The paper will conclude with the assertion that the universe in traditional Akwapim Akan thought is not divided into separate spiritual and material worlds but is most accurately regarded as one inspirited universe."

Carnap's object in this article is to determine just whatphilosophicalproblems in science are. He took this to be a question about what distinguishes the “standpoint” of a philosopher from that of the empirical investigator (1984:6). He begins with the observation that “philosophers have ever declared that their problems lie at a different level from the problems of the empirical sciences . . . the question is, however, where one should seek this level” (1984:5)."

10.2307/3185581,Tropos Logikos: Gustav Shpet's Philosophy of History,"Gustav G. Shpet (1879-1937) is one of those formidable Russian thinkers who, in the early years of the last century, orchestrated a revolutionary paradigm shift across a broad swath of the humanities and social sciences that is still reverberating today. But we lack a comprehensive view of the manifold heterogeneity of Shpet's intellectual endeavors. This article focuses on one prominent lacuna in our knowledge of Shpet: the theory of history that he advanced in the 1910s. In many respects Shpet's theory anticipated the ""linguistic turn"" that occurred in western historiography during the last quarter of the twentieth century and that is most often identified with Hayden White's name. But while White analyzes the historian's discourse in terms of tropology and narratology, for Shpet predication is the key logical mechanism that generates production of texts about the past. The divergence of these two approaches can be explained through the hidden Kantian underpinnings of White's thought that contrasts sharply with the explicit Hegelianism of Shpet's theorizing."

Many of them in many European legal cultures routinely labour, some even agonise over distinguishing public law from what appears to be a securely established field of private law. More than 20 years ago, 20 to 30 variations of the public/private-theme, usually elevated to the rank of ‘theories’, could be counted in German scholarship alone, none of them satisfying the desire to clarify, once and for all, the nature, purpose, and scope of public law.
            In this vein, law students are required to discuss at least the major demarcation theories so as, for instance, to establish jurisdiction of administrative courts, liability of the state, or the scope of constitutional rights."

Not least of these is that there is emerging a broad alliance, embracing a range of intellectual positions, which is increasingly outspoken in its criticism of the dominant vocationalism which characterises so much legal education. Neil McCormick has recently added his forceful voice to the criticism of the narrow and intellectually barren fetish of ‘learning the rules’ which constitutes the great bulk of the practice of law teaching. The context of MacCormick's advocacy of the virtues of a broad philosophical orientation in legal education was the publication of Barnett and Yach's survey of jurisprudence teaching in the United Kingdom."

Hart's ‘Descriptive Sociology’,"Some years ago, a state-of-play review of the study of Law and Society in Britain by Colin Campbell and Paul Wiles contained the almost rueful comment that ‘analytical jurisprudence and legal positivism… have proved of intimidating endurance as archetypes. As another commentator, Peter Goodrich, has noted recently, Neil MacCormick, one leading authority in the field, rejoined that ‘to confirm or confute these accounts it is necessary to take up some position in analytical philosophy and the philosophy of language. Goodrich's review of linguistics and contemporary legal philosophy indicated that this gauntlet has not been systematically taken up either by legal philosophers or even by those sociologists of law who have been most critical of the general features of legal positivism and the substantive theories legal positivists have themselves proposed."
10.1111/j.1748-121x.1985.tb00319.x,"Philosophy, ideology and rights","It would be the height of naivety to suppose that philosophical analysis of contested concepts could, of itself, result in the reconciliation of competing ideologies or achieve anything very much by way of removing the underlying divergencies of vested interests which express themselves in social and international conflict. The ‘correct’ analysis of the concept of rights is not a panacea for world peace.’ On the other hand, conceptual confusion can generate unnecessary misunderstandings and lead to misplaced disputes which are hardly conducive to the search for such common ground as exists between conflicting groups and nations and it is surely a stage on the way to such agreement as is possible to identify the genuine as opposed to the merely linguistic areas of disagreement, even if this may produce nothing beyond the agreement to differ."
10.2307/1945385,"The Philosophy of Labor Legislation: Presidential Address, American Association for Labor Legislation.","Careful study of any period will reveal that back of all the complex happenings marking such period there have been certain fundamental impulses, certain human strivings, of which the happenings themselves have been, in great part, but the manifestations, or expression in concrete action. It is the prime function of the historian to discover, explain the rise, trace the development and make known the results of these forces which have dominated mass action in the past. Only as this is done do the myriad of events going to make up the body of historical data assume a real meaning, and historical narrative become other than a dry tabulation of detail.A distinguished historian, E. A. Freeman, has well said that if history is past politics, politics is present history. If it is of value for the historian to trace out and place in their true light those great movements of the past, how much more important it is that the student of present-day politics should, by a similar examination of current events and efforts, seek to make known, and interpret the forces and aspirations now dictating the collective action of peoples."
10.2307/1947191,The Political Philosophy of Henry Adams.,"The use of superlatives is always dangerous, but it may be said, with little exaggeration, that Henry Adams was the Aristotle of America. His similarity to the great pupil of Plato, however, lies not so much in his influence upon subsequent thinkers as in the astonishing range of his interests and studies. Probably no other man of recent times has made such an ambitious effort as he to explore the entire realm of human knowledge and to deduce from it some logical answer to the riddle of the universe, with particular reference to the destiny of society. At a time when specialization had become the order of the day, and when it was considered presumptuous for a man to attempt to master more than one tiny segment of knowledge, he ranged the whole field like a titan, concerning himself with history, politics, economics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, mathematics, geology, anthropology, and psychology."
10.2307/1948760,The Legal and Political Philosophy of Leonard Nelson.,"The legal philosophy of Nelson is fundamentally a liberal doctrine. It is, on the one hand, opposed to the philosophy which places a supreme trust in human reason and which believes that man can sit down and codify a system of laws in which there will be no gaps; and, on the other, it is opposed to a belief in the necessary rationality of existing institutions in the onward sweep of human history, the idea which was so dear to the Historical School of jurisprudence.Nelson is aNaturrechtlehrerin the sense that he believes in the existence of metajuristic criteria of justice. That there are elemental principles of justice which are universal, and according to which laws are either just or unjust, decisions either right or wrong, Nelson believes cannot be denied. The moment we admit the injustice of a statute, or a judicial decision, we admit that we have used a criterion on which to base our opinion. The mistake we make, however, is to suppose that we can discover criteria, either empirically or logically."
10.2307/1950135,Absolutism and Relativism in Philosophy and Politics.,"Since there exists philosophy, there exists the attempt to bring it in relation with politics; and this attempt has succeeded in so far as it is today recognized to the degree of a truism that political theory and that part of philosophy we call ethics are closely connected with each other. But it seems strange to assume—and this essay tries to verify this assumption—that there exists an external parallelism, and perhaps also an inner relationship, between politics and other parts of philosophy such as epistemology, that is, theory of knowledge, and theory of values. It is just within these two theories that the antagonism between philosophical absolutism and relativism has its seat; and this antagonism seems to be in many respects analogous to the fundamental opposition between autocracy and democracy as the representatives of political absolutism on the one hand and political relativism on the other.IPhilosophical absolutism is the metaphysical view that there is an absolute reality, i.e., a reality that exists independently of human knowledge. Hence its existence is objective and unlimited in, or beyond, space and time, to which human knowledge is restricted. Philosophical relativism, on the other hand, advocates the empirical doctrine that reality exists only within human knowledge, and that, as the object of knowledge, reality is relative to the knowing subject. The absolute, the thing in itself, is beyond human experience; it is inaccessible to human knowledge and therefore unknowable.To the assumption of absolute existence corresponds the possibility of absolute truth and absolute values, denied by philosophical relativism, which recognizes only relative truth and relative values."
10.2307/1950512,The Political Philosophy of Young Charles A. Beard.,"In 1934, Harold J. Laski wrote of Charles A. Beard: “It is true that he has formulated no consistent or systematic philosophy of politics; none has been formulated in the America of our time. But it is clear that the day for such a formulation is rapidly approaching. When it comes, I believe it will be found that no one has made a more solid contribution than Charles Beard to the elements from which it will have to be fashioned.”It is likely that most Americans of academic bent, whether they have actually read the book or not, are aware of the stir once created byAn Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States. Certainly they could hardly have avoided some part of that flood of articles, books, and reviews which for decades has poured from the pen of Beard. Whether or not his writings have contributed to the building of an American “philosophy of politics,” it seems obvious that college youth in unknown number, scholars, and Americans in many walks of life must in some degree have been influenced by Beard in various subtle or indirect ways. The very bulk and range of his writings make it highly probable. For a check of the card catalog in a large university library, plus an examination of the Library of Congress bibliography and a few other sources, yields a total of about sixty first-edition volumes with Beard's name attached as author, co-author, or editor."
10.2307/1951467,John Locke: Philosophy and Political Theory.,"The relationship of the world of ideas to the world of events would appear to be securely established today. It is generally acknowledged that ideas “have consequences,” and that in turn they are themselves consequences of events. But recent preoccupation with this problem has perhaps obscured an equally fruitful field of investigation, namely, that of the horizontal relationship among ideas in different areas of thought. I propose to examine here the relationship and the consistency between John Locke's general philosophy and his political theory. In the main, this task resolves itself into a comparison and correlation of theEssay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke's chief philosophical work, with hisSecond Treatise of Civil Government, his principal work in political theory; but I have made use also of other writings.My problem has been considerably complicated by Lock's failure to commit himself unequivocally on several of the most crucial questions to be discussed. He frequently used imprecise language, and, regrettably, sometimes made plainly contradictory statements. These lapses reflect a deep-seated unwillingness in Locke to pursue a line of thought to an unattractive conclusion, both in philosophy and in political theory."
10.2307/1951249,Political Science and Political Philosophy.,"The dominant belief among both teachers and graduate students of political science seems to be that political theory constitutes the heart of their subject; yet political theory is not, in practice, the core of political science teaching. Such is the schizoid condition of political science and political scientists that is revealed by the investigations of the Committee for the Advancement of Teaching of the American Political Science Association. The hypothesis advanced in this note presents a dual reason for the unfortunate situation: it is partly that political theorists have failed to keep up with the times and have not engaged in sufficient value-free theoretical study of the raw data of politics, and partly that vast numbers of political scientists have falsely concluded that one of the most important parts of the traditional study of political theory—political ethics—is not susceptible of scientific treatment and should rigorously be eschewed."
10.2307/1978306,Political Philosophy and Poetry,"Sigurd Burckhardt has rendered a service in providing the occasion for a thematic presentation of the principles underlying the interpretations of Shakespearean drama by Jaffa and me, to which he has taken such exception. The issue does not primarily concern literary criticism but rather has to do with the relation of art to political philosophy and, in turn, with their relation to life. Burckhardt, however, has not joined the debate on the level of the issues. He does not argue against the substance of our interpretations, and does not say wherein and why they are in error. Characteristic of his method is his offer of three statements “admittedly out of context” from my article for which he then proposes the following test: “Choose,” he says, “a jury of widely read, intelligent men, show them these statements (with the information that they are meant to describe two main characters in a play known to all of them), and then make them guess who is being talked about.” Burckhardt thinks he is “safe in claiming that there will not be a single correct identification.” The moment seems somewhat inappropriately chosen for suggesting the method of a quiz program for deciding a matter of validity. But seriously, does any scholar, however he may wish for public acceptance, make this his standard? Agreement may produce peace, but it can never by itself be a criterion of truth. In presentingmyconclusions, I have a right to ask that they be tested in the light ofmyevidence andmyarguments. In the court of scholarly judgment it is a weak argument that rests on the number of witnesses who can be summoned to support an opinion."
10.2307/1952370,The Revival of Classical Political Philosophy: A Critique.,"Perhaps no single individual has had as much impact on the discipline of political science during the past several years as has Leo Strauss of the University of Chicago. Both he and his disciples (and they are disciples in the “classical” sense) have engaged in a full scale attack upon the premises underlying the contemporary study of politics.Strauss argues that these premises are illfounded and self-contradictory, and, if taken seriously, lead to moral nihilism. He contends, further, that another set of premises, those of “classical natural right,” which treat man in terms of his natural end and his relation to the “mysterious whole,” are capable of providing a more adequate foundation for the study of politics."
10.2307/1953215,Jackson's Judicial Philosophy: An Exploration in Value Analysis.,"Robert H. Jackson died more than a decade ago, and his departure from the Supreme Court marked the end of an era in American judicial politics, since he left behind as a minority those remaining of the colleagues who had joined with him to compose the so-called Roosevelt Court. He was still very much alive when I interviewed him shortly after theSteel Seizuredecision in 1952, and subsequently when the initial stages of the present research were designed and carried out. His unanticipated and fatal heart attack had two incidental consequences that are relevant here: it fixed an unavoidable natural closure for the data—his activities-that I was studying, and at the same time imposed an insurmountable foreclosure upon one of my research ambitions. For the best way to validate generalizations about a man's attitudinal predispositions and belief systems is to check them as predictions against his future behavior; social scientists understandably repose lesser confidence in findings about hypotheses that can be validated only statistically, and then only by retrospective testing. Perhaps it was an error, therefore, not to have switched from Jackson to some other justice as a subject; but even one who chose a younger justice (such as Arthur Goldberg) might have guessed wrongly about his tenure, and Jackson's career did offer several unusual advantages—for reasons that will be explained shortly—which it seemed important to exploit."
10.2307/1953471,Ideology and Pragmatism: Philosophy or Passion?,"In “Politics, Ideology, And Belief Systems” Professor Sartori has undertaken the Sisyphean task of drawing up conceptual schemes to distinguish the political mentalities of the pragmatist and the ideologist. His “Hypothesis” poses the curious proposition that “ideology and pragmatisms qua ‘political cultures’ are related, respectively, to the ‘cultural matrixes’ rationalism and empiricism.” (p. 402) When political scientists put forth hypotheses, students of history are usually not far behind with their arid facts and pale negations. Sartori's hypothesis is an intriguing theoretical formulation of a central issue in twentieth century politics; whether it is historically valid is the concern of this article. For the question that remains uppermost as I read his article is simply who are the ideologists and who are the pragmatists? Historically considered, if we were to apply Sartori's defining characteristics to a specific context it may very well be that the totalitarian “ideologies” of communism and fascism would have to be judged “pragmatic,” while the mentality of American political behavior may even have to be considered “ideological.” Since I am sure Professor Sartori did not have this ironic interpretation in mind, perhaps some elaboration is in order.When Marx turned Hegel on his head he not only gave a materialistic base to German idealism but imputed an activistic impulse to political theory. Dialectical materialism is the “actualization of philosophy,” the extension of contemplative thought into real life. And whether regarded as a “knowing-process” or as Sartori's “belief system,” Marxism represented a rejection of both the deductive rationalism of Descartes and the sensationalist rationalism of Locke."
10.2307/1962159,Language and Its Abuses in Hobbes' Political Philosophy,"As in Hobbes' view it is principally the capacity for speech that distinguishes men from even the social animals, so it is in verbal and doctrinal controversies that he usually finds the sources of conflict and sedition. Hobbes analyzes—in the hope of doing away with them—a variety of what he regards as abuses of language, such as metaphor, equivocation, eloquence, and absurdity, which are especially productive of political disorder. He also offers models and, in his own political philosophy, examples of the proper uses of language as science and counsel, which he believes are necessary to the establishment and governance of well-ordered commonwealths in the modern world, characterized as it is by widespread learning and disputatious habits. In the pursuance of his project, however, Hobbes himself is paradoxically forced to resort to the eloquence which he otherwise condemns, and his own observations on language provide grounds for doubts about the success of his enterprise."
10.2307/1964019,Politics and the Problem of Technology: An Essay on Heidegger and the Tradition of Political Philosophy.,"I examine Heidegger's postmodern interpretation of technology, with an eye to exposing its weaknesses. I do this by showing that his view entails an understanding of the tradition of political philosophy that cannot do justice to that tradition's own understanding of the character of technology. I consider first Plato and Aristotle and then Hobbes and Locke in order to suggest that Heidegger's view that modern politics arestampedby technological metaphysics can be challenged on two related grounds: (1) it assumes incorrectly that the tradition is dominated by dogmatic metaphysics; (2) it prevents us from seeing how some in the tradition both understood and doubted the possibility of a technological stamp. I then suggest an alternative view of technology that might account better for the character of technology and political life."
10.2307/2938961,Socrates' Aspasian Oration: The Play of Philosophy and Politics in Plato's Menexenus.,"Plato'sMenexenusis overlooked, perhaps because of the difficulty of gauging its irony. In it, Socrates recites a funeral oration he says he learned from Aspasia, describing events that occurred after the deaths of both Socrates and Pericles' mistress. But the dialogue's ironic complexity is one reason it is a central part of Plato's political philosophy. In both style and substance,Menexenusrejects the heroic account of Athenian democracy proposed by Thucydides' Pericles, separating Athenian citizenship from the quest for immortal glory; its picture of the relationship of philosopher to polis illustrates Plato's conception of the truepolitikosin theStatesman. In both dialogues, philosophic response to politics is neither direct rule nor apolitical withdrawal.Menexenuspresents a Socrates who influences politics indirectly, by recasting Athenian history and thus transforming the terms in which its political alternatives are conceived."
10.2307/421020,Alonzo Church's Contributions to Philosophy and Intensional Logic,"§0. Alonzo Church's contributions to philosophy and to that most philosophical part of logic, intensional logic, are impressive indeed. He wrote relatively few papers actually devoted to specifically philosophical issues, as distinguished from related technical work in logic. Many of his contributions appear in reviews forThe Journal of Symbolic Logic, and it can hardly be maintained that one finds there a “philosophical system”. But there occur a clearly articulated and powerful methodology, terse arguments, often of “crushing cogency”, and philosophical observations of the first importance.Many of the less formal philosophical contributions center around questions concerning meaning, but there are important clarifications and insights into matters of the epistemology and ontology of the sciences, especially the formal sciences.1.1. The logistic method. Church's writings on philosophical matters exhibit an unwavering commitment to what he called the “logistic method”. The term did not catch on and now one would just speak of “formalization”. The use of these ideas is now so common and familiar among logicians and logically-oriented philosophers that they are simply taken for granted. But they deserve to be celebrated and re-emphasized, for there are (still) philosophers who seriously underestimate and even consciously reject these techniques."
10.2307/421117,19th Century Logic Between Philosophy and Mathematics,"Abstract
            The history of modern logic is usually written as the history of mathematical or, more general, symbolic logic. As such it was created by mathematicians. Not regarding its anticipations in Scholastic logic and in the rationalistic era, its continuous development began with George Boole's The Mathematical Analysis of Logic of 1847, and it became a mathematical subdiscipline in the early 20th century. This style of presentation cuts off one eminent line of development, the philosophical development of logic, although logic is evidently one of the basic disciplines of philosophy. One needs only to recall some of the standard 19th century definitions of logic as, e.g., the art and science of reasoning (Whateley) or as giving the normative rules of correct reasoning (Herbart).
            In the paper the relationship between the philosophical and the mathematical development of logic will be discussed. Answers to the following questions will be provided:
            1. What were the reasons for the philosophers' lack of interest in formal logic?
            2. What were the reasons for the mathematicians' interest in logic?
            3. What did “logic reform” mean in the 19th century? Were the systems of mathematical logic initially regarded as contributions to a reform of logic?
            4. Was mathematical logic regarded as art, as science or as both?"
10.2307/626707,Was the Ionian Philosophy Scientific?.,"This paper is concerned with a problem which has puzzled me for many years. The Greek philosophers of the Ionian tradition, from Anaximander to Epicurus, are commonly called specially ‘scientific,’ in contrast with the Italian tradition started by Pythagoras. Why is it, then, that their systems are cast in the form of dogmatic pronouncements? It is not only that they describe, with complete confidence, matters beyond the reach of observation, such as the origin of the world; but when they come to matters of detail, they make assertions which could have been upset by a little careful observation or by the simplest experiment.It has been argued—by Burnet, for instance—that this dogmatism may be only apparent. Our evidence is fragmentary, and comes largely from manuals compiled much later by men whose object was to discredit science for reaching contradictory conclusions, and by no means to record the methods employed to reach those conclusions. W. A. Heidel, too, thought that, if we possessed the philosophers' notebooks, we should find that their results were obtained by methods akin to those of modern science, though with less awareness of the need for caution in experimental tests. Behind these arguments lies the assumption that the questions they asked themselves, the motives prompting their inquiries, and the quarter to which they looked for the sources of knowledge, were the same then as now."
10.2307/628636,The Philosophy of Ammonius Saccas: And the Connection of Aristotelian and Christian Elements Therein,"The excellent report by H.-R. Schwyzer in his long article on Plotinus in R.-E. (Bd. XLI (1951), col. 477–81), presents the reader with a picture of the present state of research concerning Ammonius, while giving a critique of previous discussions. A significant feature of the situation is this: simultaneously with the endeavour to obtain a clear picture of Ammonius's doctrine from the reports in Nemesius of Emesa and Hierocles (Photius, Bibl. cod. 214 and 251)—reports whose upper and lower limits are controversial—a new and fruitful attempt has been made to work back to Ammonius as the common source behind numerous concordances between Plotinus and Origen. Following the lead of René Cadiou, who, in his epoch-making workLa jeunesse d'Origène(Paris, 1935), demonstrated the importance of Ammonius for the development of the theology of Origen, de Jong has given a convenient conspectus of the parallels between Plotinus and Origen (Plotinus of Ammonius Saccas, Leiden, 1941). But this gives rise to some problems of general procedure. What justification is there for Schwyzer's assertion (op. cit.480. 65) that ‘it isa prioriimprobable that Plotinus would have studied the writings of Origen’? This depends upon the presupposition that Christianity, and in particular its theology, during the years of Plotinus's studies at Alexandria, was of far too slight importance, intensive or extensive, to have had any influence upon a man of the spiritual calibre of Plotinus."
10.2307/628080,Sense and Common-sense in the Development of Greek Philosophy.,"This paper forms a brief and synoptic study of the use made by Greek thinkers of explanations and causes that lie outside immediate sense-perception; and of the extent to which these unperceived causes outstripped not merely sense but also common-sense, so as to become, simply judged in themselves, unexpected, improbable, or paradoxical. I propose first to examine the main Presocratic philosophers and their predecessors, to discover how far their theories exceeded the range of sense-perception on the one hand and common-sense on the other; then to assess more briefly the reaction of the Sophists, Socrates and Plato, with some consideration of Aristotle and his successors and special attention to the concept of teleology. The aim of this survey, from which much will inevitably be omitted, is to direct from a fresh angle a slender ray of light on the nature of Greek speculative thought—on the character of its dogmatism and the character of its assumed clarity.If philosophy is the search for causes, then it must soon concern itself with the unseen, with what lies beyond perception. Proximate causes of particular sensed events may be found in other sensed events; but the philosopher's attempt to explain man's experience as a whole requires the inference of causes and relationships outside the immediate range of direct physical experience."
10.2307/631452,Posidonius' system of moral philosophy,"Seneca devoted two of his letters to Lucilius to a problem which had been treated quite differently in previous philosophical doctrine. Letter 94 is written against philosophers who believe that there is no need for praecepta, for single precepts and moral sentences or proverbs concerning individual and specific situations in human life. Moral progress rests solely and entirely upon the knowledge of some basic decreta which belong in the context of a scientific theory and provide sufficient help for every occasion in human life. The second letter, 95, deals polemically with those who admit nothing but praecepta in their educational programme and who reject every kind of dogmatic knowledge. The first group is represented by Aristo the Stoic, whose contempt of praecepta is also attested by Sextus Empiricus. For the other group, Seneca does not quote an authority. He does not mention Cynics and Sceptics who rejected moral and general dogmatism alike, and it seems to be very likely that he was thinking of his own teacher Sotion and the Sextian school who had no interest in ethical theory, but were very famous for their use of moral and psychagogic sentences.Seneca's own opinion is far from being original. He says that both—praecepta and decreta—are useful and even necessary, and this position was already held by Cleanthes, Panaetius and the majority of Stoics, by Aristotle and other philosophers."
10.2307/630426,Aristotle as historian of philosophy,"Doubts about the reliability of Aristotle's accounts of his predecessors have been current for some time, at least since Heidel's 1906 paper in which he aimed to show that the presocratics did not,paceAristotle, have Aristotle's conception ofἀλλοίωσις, involving as it does the notions of unchanging substance or essence, and attribute. Such doubts were given massive substantiation in Cherniss' famous book. More recently McDiarmid has shown that Theophrastus'Physical Opinions, the main source for the subsequent doxographical tradition, while it may quote extensively from the writings of the presocratics, is heavily dependent (in wording, selection of quotations from the presocratics, and organisation of material) on Aristotle's account. I only mention McDiarmid's work here because some of what he says provides the point of departure for Guthrie's defence of Aristotle, which I want chiefly to examine. My thesis is that there are some misunderstandings and pseudo-issues which crop up among what may be referred to as the three parties (Cherniss, McDiarmid, and Guthrie) to the dispute over the trustworthiness of Aristotle's accounts of the presocratics; but that once these are cleared away there remains a genuine disagreement over the reliability of Aristotle's interpretations; and that in this disagreement Guthrie has not given arguments sufficient to prove his point."
10.2307/629649,The philosophy of the ODYSSEY.,"The ancient critics are well known—some might say notorious—for their readiness to read literature, and particularly Homer, through moral spectacles. Their interpretations of Homeric epic are philosophical, not only in the more limited sense that they identified specific doctrines in the speeches of Homer's characters, making the poet or his heroes spokesmen for the views of Plato or Epicurus, but also in a wider sense: the critics demand from Homer not merely entertainment but enlightenment on moral and religious questions, on good and evil, on this life and the after-life. When they fail to find what they seek, they follow Plato and find him wanting."
10.2307/632028,Philosophy and rhetoric in the Menexenus,"Plato'sMenexenusopens with a scene of typical Socratic interest in the young, as Socrates questions Menexenus about his activities and intentions. This scene, however, I would suggest, is not simply an illustration of Socrates' characteristic behaviour, forming a suitable introduction to this or any other dialogue. Its relation to the work as a whole is closer than this: it raises a question with which theMenexenusmay best be understood as being essentially concerned."
10.2307/3172143,Sangalan Oral Traditions as Philosophy and Ideologies ,"Sangalan is located in northeast Guinea in the région of MaliYambering. It was a federation of groups of villages, consisting of three taane (kafo in Malinke, districts or groups of villages): Dombiya, Uyukha, and Djulabaya. To these three taane correspond three ethnic subgroups, the Dombiyanne, Uyukhanne, and Djulabayanne. The Dombiyanne were mostly the Keita families; the Uyukhanne the Camara; and the Djulabayanne the Nyakhasso. The people of Sangalan are Dialonka—those living in Sangalan are called the Sangalanka. They are originally all from Dialonkadougou, at first a province of the Soso empire founded and ruled by Sumanguru Kante, and later a province of the empire of Mali, created by Sundiata Keita in the thirteenth century. The Sangalanka call themselves “Sosoe Forine” (Old Sosoe), the Sosoe who lived on the high mountains (dialon) of both the Soso and Manden empires. They call the other Sosoe, living along the Guinean coast, Bani Sosone (Sosoe of the Coast, near the water). The Soso Forine and Bani Sosone lived in the Futa Jallon and were driven away by the Fulani invaders in the eighteenth century."
10.1017/s0373463300033853,Marine Radar Automatic Plotter Display Philosophy,"The object of any kind of marine radar plot when ships are in fog is to synthetize as much data on the current traffic situation as affects or will affect the safety of own ship and so to produce a plan picture of the area around the ship and the vessels moving on it, more or less as it would appear to the eye in clear weather. The plot will be expected to show, not only the current position of each ‘target’ vessel, but also the expected forward movement of each and the risk of collision which this involves.The word synthetize is used because it so completely implies the building up of separate elements of information into a whole; in this case, a continually changing whole. The word whole is also worth emphasizing, because only if the situation is so presented can the mariner appreciate the form which its development is taking both between own ship and those target ships which present a direct threat and between target vessels whose mutual evasive manœuvres may indirectly endanger own ship. The needed synthesis cannot be attained unless the predicted future positions of target ships are coordinated in time, so that the relative positions at the future time may be compared with the current relative positions."
10.1017/s0373463300032471,Guidance and Control Philosophy for All-weather Landing,"This paper, which was presented at an Institute meeting held in London on 21 January 1970, suggests a range of philosophical implications which result from the interaction of guidance and control systems in the context of all-weather landing of fixed-wing aircraft. It then attempts to deduce the considerations which must be applied to the approach to the engineering solution to the guidance and control problem.In the context of this paper the terms guidance and control have specialized connotations which have achieved the status of common usage.As they are used in the all-weather operations (AWO) jargon they are easier to define as adjectives than as nouns; the ‘guidance system’ is the system which defines the flight-path which the landing aircraft must follow and the ‘control system’ is that part of the aircraft equipment which enables the aircraft to follow the flight-path which has been defined by the guidance system."
10.1017/s0373463300042739,"Philosophy, Rules and the Collision Problem","CaptainWylie begins his paper by evoking a philosophic vision: a planet full of colliding ships, all staffed by mathematicians. He concludes by rejecting, on behalf of mariners, the help of the mathematicians. The maritime record also evokes a vision: the colliding ships are somewhat fewer, but the main difference is that every one is staffed by persons other than mathematicians. The latter vision rather implies a need for help from somewhere."
10.1017/s0373463300028952,A Philosophy of Navigation,"Six years ago, Mr. D. H. Sadler, in a memorable Presidential Address, answered the question ‘What is the Institute?’ This leads to the complementary and perhaps even more controversial question ‘What is navigation? What is its scope and its general pattern?’If we look at the word Navigation in a dictionary, we may very well find that it is associated only with the sea. Today, of course, a much wider view is taken and the word is accepted as having to do with the land and the air and even with space. The definition: ‘the art of conducting a vessel on its ways’, may therefore be amended in words such as:Navigation is the business of conducting a craft as it moves about its ways."

By the time of this meeting on May 2, 1972, all of the educators around the table had worked together in the tightly knit community of Protestant fundamentalist education for decades. Those close relationships, however, only made the meeting's confrontational agenda all the more awkward and tense. Beka Horton read the charges. Horton, with her husband Arlin, had founded a thriving fundamentalist school in Pensacola, Florida. The Hortons had invited Dayton Hobbs for support. Hobbs was, like the Hortons, a graduate of fundamentalist Bob Jones University (BJU) and founder of a fundamentalist school in Florida. The Hortons accused Walter Fremont and Phil Smith, leaders of the education faculty at BJU, of one of the most devastating charges in the world of fundamentalist education. They had called this meeting with Bob Jones III, current leader of BJU and grandson of the founder, in order to apprise him of their suspicions that Fremont and Smith had become progressive educators."
10.3366/e174236000900080x,Experience and Testimony in Hume's Philosophy,"ABSTRACTThe standard interpretation of Hume on testimony takes him to be a reductionist; justification of beliefs from testimony ultimately depends on one's own first-person experience. Yet Hume's main discussions of testimony in theTreatiseand firstEnquirysuggest a social account. Hume appeals to shared experience and develops norms of belief from testimony that are not reductionist. It is argued that the reductionist interpretation rests on an overly narrow view of Hume's theory of ideas. By attending to such mechanisms of the imagination as abstraction and fictions, it is shown that Hume's theory of ideas does not forestall a non-reductionist social epistemology."

10.2307/977779,"The Positivist Philosophy in Mexican Education, 1867-1873","Positivism in educational thought in 1867 was the rational expression of a liberating philosophy which had been operating upon the Mexican scene from the turn of the century. Under the aegis of liberalism educational theory had moved slowly forward, but application had lagged far behind. This situation was not an unnatural consequence of the chaotic conditions which obtained after the achievement of independence. Independence had brought political freedom, but the masses, economically and culturally, had gained little.
            As early as 1823 educators had clamored for popular education, and although public education was given some consideration during succeeding administrations, hopes of realizing changes in education were lost within the maelstrom of social and political intrigues. The control of education was thus left in the hands of individuals, many of whom were not fit to be teachers, or to the Church, whose attention to education was greatly lessened by the growing Church-State question."

Of these, the most immediately practical in intent, and the one which directly led to the formation of the course at the University of Missouri, was a desire to furnish a relevant course in philosophy for the use of students in Spanish, history and the Latin-American studies area. This factor has turned out to be of secondary importance at Missouri, since only a small part of the students who take the course are from the fields named. The value of this motive will necessarily vary from campus to campus, and it may well be of considerable magnitude in many situations."

At last, we point out the contributions of this theoretical approach to contemporary studies on the history of scientific experiments."
10.2307/27652941,Lyricism and Philosophy in Brodsky's Elegiac Verse,"In this article Aaron Beaver analyzes two elegies written by Joseph Brodsky—one for his father (“Pamiati ottsa: Avstraliia“) and one for his mother (“Mysl’ o tebe udaliaetsia …“). The point of departure is Brodsky's appropriation of the genre from his Silver Age predecessors (Anna Akhmatova, Osip Mandel'shtam, Marina Tsvetaeva), as made evident in a number of Brodsky's well-known essays. Beaver's central thesis is that Brodsky reshapes the elegy by centering it not on the death of the loved one but on time. Brodsky is inspired in this endeavor by his Silver Age forebears, but he extends their poetic practice into more philosophical territory. Specifically, close reading of Brodsky's two elegies exposes a model of time consistent with the temporal idealism elaborated by Jean- Paul Sartre in Being and Nothingness. Based on this exegesis Beaver ventures to generalize about the nature of lyricism in Brodsky's verse, arguing that it is inseparable from his philosophical assumptions."

Such notion is not an original invention made by Latinamericanists. On the contrary, I demonstrate that the genealogy of the notion of historical handicap must be sought in the tradition of Western political philosophy. Such genealogy must take into account the way it was integrated into ethnological descriptions. When and how did the Other become the backward, the primitive? While this relation was secondary for ancient Greek thought, theories of historical development became the main source of ethnological categories in the modern era. Interestingly enough, this modern synthesis suited the practical purpose of justifying two successive waves of European imperialistic: the era of discoveries, and 19th century colonialism. The article concludes by raising questions about the present role and application of the social sciences."

The recently established Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Erforschung des politischen Denkens, in the person of Volker Gerhardt (Cologne), had invited some sixty senior philosophers, political theorists and political scientists from both sides of the inner-German border to discuss basic questions in political philosophy. The meeting was not a conference. The organizer, recognising the absence of any shared traditions of inquiry and debate, had issued invitations to a mere meeting. It was the first such meeting since the collapse of the East German Communist regime. In fact, it offered the first opportunity after almost six decades of dictatorships in the East for academics from the former front-lines, as it were, to reflect openly together on their subject, on their academic pasts and on their possible academic futures. Initially, the atmosphere was very tense. But, amazingly, the tensions soon evaporated. A strange sort of civility came to characterize the discussions both inside and outside the conference rooms. Conflicts were largely avoided, to the obvious relief of most participants. From an inner- German perspective, the meeting was a great success. At the end, Ernst Vollrath (Cologne) summed up a general view: ‘We have begun to see that we can learn from one another.’ But this reciprocity was not evident in the academic discussions. Something else was involved apart from the surface issue of Marxism-Leninism versus the rest of the world. It is worth reflecting on the development of the meeting and on what this something else was."

Nevertheless, there are periods when history seems to collapse in on itself, and the time-span of change so contracts that revolution, not only political, becomes almost a norm. Since the Industrial Revolution many writers have dealt with the ideological reaction to the predicaments of rapid social change. J. S. Mill described the English public of his day as caught between two warring camps of the ‘Men of the Past’ and the ‘Men of the Present’, those who wish to return to the certainties of an earlier age, and those who wish to hasten change in the hope of a better future. Such a division is clearly simplistic, but it expresses the sense of bifurcation in society. ‘Past’ and ‘Present’ serve in this context as omnibus terms for multi-dimensional complexities which allow ample scope for individual selection, organization and evaluation."

Nevertheless, Bergson's philosophy was thought to have a political meaning that could be deduced from its principles. Despite their different, even contradictory, conclusions about it, Bergson's philosophy influenced several leading figures in France – Georges Sorel, Charles Péguy, Charles Maurras and Charles de Gaulle – and through them the course of French history. Significantly, Bergson's philosophical arguments interested them more than his relatively minor, but concrete, statements about contemporary politics. Bergson's mature thought on moral and political life was shaped principally by the First world War: Les Deux sources de la moral et de la religion appeared after Sorel and Péguy were dead and when Maurras and the Action Franqaise no longer figured so prominently in French politics. Even de Gaulle, who came to prominence much later than the others and who really belongs more to the second half of the century than they do, appears to have taken no interest in Les Deux sources. Rather, Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience and L'Évolution créatrice in which Bergson states his critique of ‘conceptual thinking’ and his theories of consciousness and biological evolution, comprise ‘Bergsonism’ in politics – not Bergson's own politics. These ironically find no consistent representation in the movements or political theories discussed below. The difference between what Bergson stood for and favoured in politics and what others thought his philosophy implied for politics is most striking and points to the difficulties inherent in taking practical advice from metaphysical arguments. There are, then, two problems surrounding Bergson's influence in France, one of which has already been alluded to and will be discussed at some length. The other is much more diffuse, but defines Bergson's political reputation today."

This problem is not easily defined; but the difficulty recalls Alfred Cobban's complaint twenty-five years ago that political theory had become disen aged Lom ‘political facts’ and ‘political practice’ and transformed into an ‘academic discipline’. My concern is with the ‘philosophization’ of political theory. By this I do not mean simply that political theory is not relevant to politics or has become detached from actual political issues – although this is probably quite true – but that it has tended to become a residue of arguments in academic philosophy. The bios theoretikos and the bios philosophikos have become indistinguishable.

10.1100/tsw.2006.338,Clinical Holistic Medicine: The Case Story of Anna. III. Rehabilitation of Philosophy of Life During Holistic Existential Therapy for Childhood Sexual Abuse,"When we experience life events with overwhelming emotional pain, we can escape this pain by making decisions (in our mind) that transfer responsibility from our existence to the surrounding world. By doing this, we slowly destroy the essence of our being, health, quality of life, and ability to function. The case of Anna is an excellent example of such a systematic destruction of self, done to survive the extreme pressure from childhood abuse and sexual abuse. The case study shows that the damage done to us by traumatic events is not on our body or soul, but rather our philosophy of life. The important consequence is that we can heal our existence by letting go of the negative decisions taken in the past painful and traumatic situations. By letting go of the life-denying sentences, we come back to life and take responsibility for our own life and existence. The healing of Annas existence was done by existential holistic therapy. Although the processing did not always run smoothly, as she projected very charged material on the therapists on several occasions, the process resulted in full health and a good quality of life due to her own will to recover and heal completely. The case illustrates the inner logic and complexity of intensive holistic therapy at the most difficult moment, where only a combination of intensive medical, psychiatric, and sexological treatment could set her free. In the paper, we also present a meta-perspective on intensive holistic therapy and its most characteristic phases."

10.1075/cat.2.1.05pra,Gandhi's Philosophy of Work and Its Contemporary Relevance,"There is a crisis of work in contemporary technological society. Afunctional definition of work feeds, and is fed by, an economico-technological ideology that valorizes the cult of productivity and of ""total work"". This in turn reflects a utilitarian conception of the human being, whose worth is now measured in terms of his or her contribution to total ""output"". Gandhi was one of the sharpest critics of this notion of man and society; he sees it as materialistic, soulless and fundamentally violent. In its place he proposes a moral conception of work that reflects his spiritual view of the human person. E.F. Schumacher takes Gandhi's ideas further in terms of an organization of economic life that promotes simplicity, beauty, social responsibility and ecological sustainability. The phenomenon of globalization heightens the stark contrast between the world-views of Gandhi and Schumacher on the one hand, and that of global capitalism on the other."
10.1075/hl.25.1-2.13pel,Logic of Language and Philosophy of Language in 20th-Century Poland,"SUMMARYThe logic of language and the philosophy of language in 20th-century Poland ran in two mainstreams, the so-called Lvov-Warsaw school and and that of phenomenological thought. The former was dominant, the latter was represented mainly by the work of Roman Ingarden (1903-1970). Among works of the Lvov-Warsaw school, the present paper considers the most important achievements of its founder, Kazimierz Twardowski (1866-1938), and the oldest generation of his disciples: Lesniewski (1886-1939), Kotar-binski (1886-1981), Ajdukiewicz (1890-1963), and Izydora Dambska (1904-1983), as well as Alfred Tarski (1902-1983) who, in philosophy, was a disciple of Jan Lukasiewicz (1878-1956), Lesniewski and Kotarbinski. The paper is limited to the discussion of the most important of their reflections on natural language, in particular to what is most characteristic of them: elaborated and deep analyses of semantic sections connected with epistemological ones, and pragmatic sections connected with psychological ones, all presented with great attention to clarity, precision and comprehensibility of formulations. Major semantic conceptions of Ingarden were also mentioned: the theory of meaning as a relation between an intending object and an intentional object, as well as semantic differences between a name, verb and sentence.RÉSUMÉLa logique du langage et la philosophie du langage en Pologne au XXe siècle se divisaintt en deux courants, celui de la soi-disante École de Lvov-Varsovie et celui de la pensée phénoménologique. Le premier des deux courants était plus important; les travaux de Roman Ingarden (1903-1970) représentaient largement le second. Parmi les ouvrages de l'École de Lvov-Var-sovie, le présent article traite des réussites les plus importantes de son fondateur, Kazimierz Twardowski (1866-1938), et de la génération la plus ancienne de ses disciples, à savoir, Lesniewski (1888-1939), Kotarbirîski (1886— 1981), Ajdukiewicz (1890-1963), et Izydora Dambska (1904-1983), et également d'Alfred Tarski (1902-1983), qui, en philosophie, fut le disciple de Jan Lukasiewicz (1878-1956), de Lesniewski and de Kotarbinski. L'article se borne à discuter leurs reflections les plus importantes traitant du langage naturel, en particulier de ce qu'en sont les traits les plus caractéristiques, à savoir, les analyses élaborées et approfondies des parties sémantiques connectées avec les aspects épistémologiques, et des parties pragmatiques liées à des aspects psychologiques. Tout cela est présenté avec beaucoup d'attention donnée à la clarté, la précision et la compréhension des formulations. Les conceptions sémantiques les plus imporantes d'Ingarden sont mentionnées également: la théorie du sens comme un rapport entre un object entendu et un object intentionnel, et également les différences sémantiques entre nom, verbe et phrase.ZUSAMMENFASSUNGDie Sprachlogik und die Sprachphilosophie in Polen des 20.

Der Aufsatz beschränkt sich auf eine Diskussion ihrer wichtigsten Über-legungen zur natürlichen Sprache, insbesondere, was sie wohl am besten characterisiert: elaborierte und tiefe Analysen der semantischen Aspekte im Zusammenhang mit epistemologischen und pragmatischen Aspekten, die psychologischen verbunden sind. All diese werden mit großer Aufmerksam-keit in bezug auf Klarheit, Präzision und Verständnisumfang der Formulie-rung vorgeführt. Ebenfalls werden die hauptsächlichen semantischen Auf-fassungen Ingardens behandelt: die Bedeutungstheorie als Relation zwischen einem beabsichtigenden und einem beabsichtigten Objekt ebenso.wie die Bedeutungsunterschiede zwischen Name, Verb und Satz.STRESZCZENIELogika jçzyka i filozofia jçzyka w Polsce XX w. piynçla dwoma nurtami: 1) tzw. szkoly lwowsko-warszawskiej, 2) mysli fenomenologicznej.

10.4102/hts.v67i3.855,Descriptive currents in philosophy of religion for Hebrew Bible studies,"This article argued that the utilisation of philosophy of religion in the study of the Hebrew Bible is possible if we look beyond the stereotype of erroneously equating the auxiliary field with natural theology, apologetics or atheological criticism. Fruitful possibilities for interdisciplinary research are available in the form of descriptive varieties of philosophy of religion primarily concerned with understanding and the clarification of meaning rather than with the stereotypical tasks of propositional justification or critical evaluation. Three examples are discussed in the article: analytic traditions (Wittgensteinianism and ordinarylanguage philosophy), phenomenological perspectives involving reduction (bracketing) and comparative philosophy of religion that works in tandem with the history of religion and comparative religion."

Others argued that once an imam always an imam and continued to recognize Isma'il. Prof. Bernard Lewis has pointed out that there are hints at something worse than drunkenness, perhaps heresy. Sunni writers represent the Isma'ilis as godless with seven stages of initiation leading up to a repudiation of all religion but this is due to a misunderstanding and to the belief that every secret doctrine must be evil. Till recently, the Isma'ilis kept their books hidden from the profane and this secrecy still persists but some of their books have now been published though the texts are usually corrupt and need the oral tradition of interpretation to explain them fully."
10.2307/4048415,"The Testimony of Nature: Boyle, Hooke and Experimental Philosophy","“The Office of the sense shall be the only judge of the experiment, and … the experiment itself shall judge of the thing.”
            Francis Bacon, The Great Instauration
            
            The first history of the Royal Society of London, published in 1667, and the most recent full study of that scientific organization published three centuries later, agree on one important point: that Sir Francis Bacon was the intellectual progenitor of the body, that in the denigrating words of a contemporary critic the Society was “Bacon-faced.” The author of the former, Thomas Sprat, termed Bacon the “one great Man, who had the true Imagination of the whole extent of this Enterprise,” and in “whose Books there are every where scattered the best arguments that can be produced for the defence of Experimental Philosophy.” The author of the latter, Margery Purver, agrees that “Bacon was the great formative influence on the Society's concept of science.”
            Yet it must be conceded at once that Bacon's legacy was ambiguous. While the early Royal Society indeed was Bacon-faced, “it saw many faces of Bacon.” The period after the founding of the Society, the 1660's and 1670's, was one of contending philosophies and of a continuing effort to fashion clearer notions of what an experimental philosophy was to be like and what role experience was to play in scientific argument. Two of the more important and influential members of the Society who were actively engaged in this pursuit were Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke; these men were, and saw themselves, as disciples of the Lord Chancellor. It is my intention here to illustrate the differing approaches to the Baconian legacy of Boyle and of Hooke by focusing attention upon an interesting analogy, used by both, which may aid us in interpreting the conception of experiment in the works of these two founders of the experimental philosophy."
10.4102/hts.v67i1.879,"Shifting frontiers of transcendence in theology, philosophy and science","This article dealt cursorily with developments in theology, philosophy and the sciences that have contributed to what one might call horizontal transcendence. The premise is that humans have evolved into beings that are wired for transcendence. Transcendence is described in terms of the metaphor of frontiers and frontier posts. Although the frontiers of transcendence shift according to the insights, understanding and needs of every epoch and world view, it remains transcendent, even in its immanent mode. Diverse perceptions of that frontier normally coexist in every era and we can only discern  a posteriori which was the dominant one. Frontiers are fixed with reference to the epistemologies, notions of the subject and power structures of a given era. From a theological point of view, encounter with the transcendent affords insight, not into the essence of transcendence, but into human self-understanding and understanding of our world. Transcendence enters into the picture when an ordinary human experience acquires a depth and an immediacy that are attributed to an act of God. In philosophy, transcendence evolved from a noumenal metaphysics focused on the object (Plato), via emphasis on the epistemological structure and limits of the knowing subject (Kant) and an endeavour to establish a dynamic subject-object dialectics (Hegel), to the assimilation of transcendence into human existence (Heidegger). In the sciences certain developments opened up possibilities for God to act in non-interventionist ways. The limitations of such an approach are considered, as well as promising new departures – and their limitations – in the neurosciences. From all of this I conclude that an immanent-transcendent approach is plausible for our day and age."

10.1100/tsw.2007.261,"Quality of Life and Philosophy of Life Determines Physical and Mental Health: Status Over Research Findings From The Quality of Life Research Center, Copenhagen, 1991-2007","Quality of life (QOL) has over the past decade become an important part of health science and also increased public awareness. It has become increasingly apparent that illness is closely related to the individual perception of a good life, and therefore the exploration of indicators related to quality of life appears to be of broad importance for the prevention and treatment of diseases. Identifying, which factors constitute a good life may reveal an understanding about what areas in life should be encouraged, in order to enhance the global quality of life, health, and ability. In this paper we present results from studies initiated in 1989 to examine quality of life in relation to disease. The purpose of this presentation was to assemble the results from the study carried out in the years between 1993 and 1997, examining a total of 11.500 Danes, to show the association between quality of life and a wide series of social indicators."
10.1017/s147717561100008x,THREE CHEERS FOR SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY!,"Stephen Hawking recently caused controversy by suggesting that philosophy had become obsolete in the face of the advance of modern science. Hawking'sThe Grand Designis only the latest in a long series of premature notifications of the obsolescence of philosophy. A wide range of writers, including but not limited to scientists and philosophers, have suggested that philosophy, in part or in whole, has been superseded by the sciences in a way that, all things considered, justifies its abandonment. Some forty years ago, E.O. Wilson suggested that the province of ethics should be turned over to biology, forty years before that the logical positivists had drawn up plans for the formation of a ‘scientific philosophy’, and before that, in the nineteenth century, Comte had identified philosophy as the mere precursor to a modern, ‘positive’ stage of human culture. The list of examples could be extended, a fact which prompts the point that, if philosophy is dying, then it is putting up quite a fight."
10.1192/bjp.28.124.519,The Philosophy of Restraint in the Management and Treatment of the Insane,"There is a very general impression among members of the medical profession abroad that it is only by the free use of stupifying drugs that British alienists are able to dispense with the use of mechanical appliances in the management of the insane. It cannot be gainsaid that, by the use of toxic remedies, noisy and violent patients may be as effectually controlled for the time being as by any species of mechanical appliance; nor can it be denied that in many of our asylums narcotics and sedatives are employed in such doses, so continuously, arid for such purposes as to justify the appellation of “chemical restraint.” But there are no facts to bear out the assumption that it is by excessive drugging we are enabled to avoid the use of restraining apparatus in our asylums. On the contrary, there is incontrovertible evidence to show that in foreign asylums where mechanical restraint is extensively practised, chemical restraint is likewise employed to an extent not thought of in this country. Dr. Wilbur∗ has been at pains to collect statistics for purposes of comparing the relative extent to which mechanical and chemical restraint is carried in British and American asylums. The result of his investigation clearly shows that in British asylums and in the few American asylums conducted on non-restraint principles, chemical restraint is not the substitute or alternative for mechanical restraint, but that, on the contrary, the general rule seems to be: the more mechanical restraint, the more chemical restraint."
10.1192/bjp.28.123.347,The Philosophy of Restraint in the Management and Treatment of the Insane,"Only since advancing science has demonstrated the true connection between mind and body, and dispelled the illusory fancies of metaphysicians, has a rational philosophy sprang up regarding the nature of mental processes. The study ot psychology having at length been placed on a proper basis and freed from the spiritualistic haze with which it has so long been shrouded, there is now great reason to hope that much may be accomplished in elucidating the various phenomena of mental disease. No study of insanity that is not founded on a physical basis can be of any real value in throwing light on the many phases of mental disorder, or in assisting to a knowledge of the proper method of treatment and management of the insane."

10.1192/bjp.26.113.119,8. Retrospect of Mental Philosophy (Periodical Literature),"The first number for the year is not remarkable for any paper of striking value. Readers of the Journal will be chiefly attracted by the long and clearly written resumé of Dr. Hughlings Jackson's recent studies “On Affections of Speech from Disease of the Brain,” which is contributed by Mr. James Sully. He remarks on the great value of Dr. Jackson's attempts to classify the different forms of aphasia under the three main heads or stages of—(1) Defect of Speech, in which the patient has a full vocabulary, but confuses words; (2) Loss of Speech, in which the patient is practically speechless, and his pantomimic power is impaired as well; and (3) Loss of Language, in which, besides being speechless, he has altogether lost the power of pantomime, and even his faculty of emotional language is deeply involved in the wreck. All these states or stages again are, properly speaking, to be distinguished altogether from affections of speech in the way of loss of articulation (owing to paralysis of the tongue, &amp;amp;c.), or loss of vocalisation (owing to disease of the larynx); whereas the three degrees or stages of aphasia proper are due to a deep-seated and severe disorganisation of the brain. The main interest of the theory lies in the ingenious and carefully-argued analysis of the symptoms, by which Dr. Jackson arrives at the theory that as the process of destruction goes on, the superior “layers” or strata of speech fail first—those namely which involve the ordinary power of adapting sounds to the circumstances of the moment as they arise; after them fail the “more highly organized utterances” those, namely, which have in any way become automatic, such as “come on,” “wo! wo!” and even “yes” and “no,” which stand on the border-line between emotional and intellectual language; next fails the power of adapting other than vocal signs to convey an intended meaning, which is called, rather clumsily, “pantomimic propositionising;” and last of all dies out the power of uttering sounds or making signs expressive merely of emotion—a power which, of course, is not true speech at all."
10.1192/bjp.29.125.111,1. Retrospect of Mental Philosophy,"During the long period embraced in the present Retrospect, the most important incident that has happened in the philosophical circles of this country is the death of Professor T. H. Green, of Oxford—a man who for many years had been silently acquiring, not only by his power of thinking but by his strong and blameless personal character, a marked position and a unique influence among the leaders of thought in England. His philosophical position would perhaps best be defined by saying that he became the chief of that small, but notable, band of speculative students, centred mainly in Oxford, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, who are reviving the spirit of the systems of Kant and Hegel, in its application to the new scientific, political, and religious problems of the day. His distinguishing characteristics were his modesty and his earnest sense of duty—qualities perhaps not so conspicuous as they might be amongst the better known of modern psychologists. His modesty was such that he never assumed that he had mastered the secret of any writer, until he had bestowed the most extravagant labour and thought in exploring difficulties and obscurities on which the man himself had probably never bestowed a second thought. His earnestness was so thorough that he believed it to be merely his duty to struggle with the fundamental questions of the Sphinx of modern criticism, and find for himself and others not a negative but a constructive answer, no matter what toil and trouble it might cost. For he held that those who contribute, as we all in some way do, to the formation of public opinion upon the vital subjects of life and conduct, are under a terrible responsibility if they mislead their neighbours, or even if they refuse by sloth or vanity or cynicism that healthy guidance which their own attainments would enable them to give. These remarks are suggested by the fact that the first article of the April number of “Mind” is from Prof. Green's pen. Indeed it is one of the last pieces of work he ever personally sent to press; although we are glad to know that the groat Ethical work on which he had long been engaged is left with his philosophical friends in so complete a form that it will be published immediately. The April article is the second of three essays on the question, “Can there be a natural science of man?” of which the third holds the leading place in the July number. The scope of the essays, as well as of the “Prolegomena to Ethics,” to which they were in a sense introductory, will be best indicated if we quote a note added in the July number by Prof. Green's literary executor, Mr. A. C. Bradley."
10.1192/bjp.54.226.473,A Philosophy of Psychiatry,"“What we gain from speculative philosophy is not so much answers to questions which common sense universally asks, as the knowledge that these questions themselves, since they are based on untrue concepts, must vanish away.”—Paul Möller."
10.31269/triplec.v16i2.985,Marx’s Philosophy of Revolution in Permanence: Its Significance for Our Time,"How can Marx’s ideas help us with the problem of how to make new revolutionary beginnings in a time when the counterrevolution is ascendant, without losing sight of the need to prepare for the equally crucial question of what happens after the revolution? Capitalism has taken various forms as it developed, with the latest shaped by its endemic crisis since the mid-1970s generated by its falling rate of profit. Throughout these stages, the humanism and dialectic of Capital remain prime determinants of allowing Marxist responses not to stop at economic analyses but to release, rather than inhibiting, new revolutionary subjects and directions. Critical for the present moment is to take up Marx’s humanism and dialectic as crucial dimensions of his philosophy of revolution in permanence. This encompasses not alone the famous March 1850 Address to the Communist League, but also the full trajectory of Marx's revolutionary life and thought from the 1844 Economic-Philosophic Manuscripts through Capital to the new moments of Marx's last decade as expressed in his writings on Russia and his Ethnological Notebooks. We trace Marx's theoretical/philosophical concept of permanent revolution in a number of his writings, to confront how various post-Marx Marxists addressed or ignored this dimension of Marx's thought, and explore whether this concept can be seen as central to Marx's body of thought, and can assist in the dual task of needed revolutionary transformation – the destruction of the old (negation) and the construction of the new (the negation of the negation)."
10.2478/s13374-011-0029-1,The linguistic-pragmatic turn in the history of philosophy,"AbstractDid the pragmatic turn encompass the linguistic turn in the history of philosophy? Or was the linguistic turn a turn away from pragmatism? Some commentators identify the so-called “eclipse” of pragmatism by analytic philosophy, especially during the Cold War era, as a turn away from pragmatist thinking. However, the historical evidence suggests that this narrative is little more than a myth. Pragmatism persisted, transforming into a more analytic variety under the influence of Quine and Putnam and, more recently, a continental version in the hands of Richard Rorty and Cornel West. In this paper, I argue that proof of the linguistic turn’s presence as a moment in a broader pragmatic turn in philosophy can be garnered from close examination of a single article, W. V. O. Quine’s “Two Dogmas of Empiricism,” and a single issue: whether the analytic-synthetic distinction is philosophically defensible."
10.1192/pb.18.6.343,The attitudes of psychiatrists to philosophy,"Questionnaires exploring the attitudes of psychiatrists to philosophy were distributed at two meetings of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Out of a possible 240, 126 questionnaires were returned (53%). The results showed a surprisingly high level of interest in and support for philosophy. Over 50% of respondents indicated that they considered conceptual analysis, ethics, jurisprudence, the philosophy of science and the philosophy of mind to be practically important in psychiatry. Similarly, 89% believed that ethics, and 72% that other areas of philosophy, should be included in the MRCPsych syllabus. The significance of the study is reviewed briefly."

During this centennial year I should like to look at the poet's last publication and take note of his valedictory remarks particularly as they touch on his well-known “philosophy of the imperfect,” which I believe can be better understood as a philosophy of inadequacy. To that end I shall focus on the poem “Development,” which gives a general idea of what Browning had to say not only inAsolandobut in much of his earlier work as well."
10.1100/tsw.2004.103,Philosophy of Science: How to Identify the Potential Research for the Day after Tomorrow?,"We were asked to participate in a workshop to assist the European Commission on how to choose financial support for high-potential, basic research projects that can give new scientific breakthroughs and thus contribute significantly to the positive development of society, industry, and economy for the day after tomorrow. At this workshop, we analyzed the problem in some detail using experience from our own research on the global quality of life. We would suggest that the most promising projects have the following characteristics: (1) they are led by a brilliant researcher who considers his/her research to be “sweet science”, who wants to explain the anomalies of his/her field of science, and who lives in a nonmainstream scientific paradigm; (2) they are deeply engaged in the philosophical problems of their research field, they are searching eagerly for a new understanding and a new theory, giving new tools for measurement and creating change, and results are taken as feedback on all levels from tool to theory and philosophy; (3) they are focused on the key point(s), which is an essential feature of the universe that creates global change if intervened upon. At the NEST Pathfinder 2005 Topic Identification Workshop, Brussels 28 May 2004 entitled “Measuring the Impossible”, we advised the European Commission Research Directorate to allocate funds for projects focusing on the state of consciousness  how to understand it, how to map it, and how to develop it."
10.1017/s0953820811000264,No Philosophy for Swine: John Stuart Mill on the Quality of Pleasures,"I argue that Mill introduced the distinction between quality and quantity of pleasures in order to fend off the then common charge that utilitarianism is ‘a philosophy for swine’ and to accommodate the (still) widespread intuition that the life of a human isbetter, in the sense of beingintrinsicallymore valuable, than the life of an animal. I argue that in this he fails because in order to do successfully he would have to show not only that the life of a human is preferable to that of an animal on hedonistic grounds, but also that it is in some sense nobler or more dignified to be a human, which he cannot do without tacitly presupposing non-hedonistic standards of what it means to lead a good life."

Hare's Achievements in Moral Philosophy,"In his Axel Hägerström Lectures, given in Sweden in 1991, Dick Hare referred to Hägerström as a pioneer in ethics who had made the most important breakthrough that there had been in ethics during the twentieth century. Although Hägerström's development of a nondescriptivist approach to ethics certainly was pioneering philosophical work, when the history of twentieth century ethics comes to be written, I believe that it is Hare's own work that will be seen as having made the most important contribution."
10.1017/s0953820800001345,Jeremy Bentham on the Relief of Indigence: An Exercise in Applied Philosophy,"This paper will attempt to provide an overview of Bentham's fundamental thinking with regard to the relief of indigence. The manuscripts on which it draws form the texts of unpublished works, namely a set of ‘Three Essays on the Poor Laws’, which were completed by Bentham, and ‘Pauper Systems Compared’, which remains in a comparatively unfinished state. In the ‘Essays’, Bentham considers first the question of whether the relief of indigence should be a public responsibility, and, having concluded that it should, moves on to consider what conditions should be attached to that relief. In ‘Systems Compared’, Bentham analyzes different systems of provision in terms of their compatibility with these conditions."
10.1017/s0953820800004222,‘The very culture of the feelings’: Poetry and Poets in Mill's Moral Philosophy,"Interpretations of Mill's response to literature are often placed within a larger analysis of the development of his ethical thought. Such interpretations commonly seek to describe the importance to Mill's intellectual development of the episode in his personal experience, recollected in Chapter V of hisAutobiography, which awakened him to the value of poetry and to the need for an active cultivation of personal feeling. The connection between the two is usually made by demonstrating how his mature ethical thought integrates ideas that were first brought home to him during this reaction against the logical rigour of his background and upbringing, a reaction that contrasts Mill's acceptance of the importance of personal culture and emotion with the scant regard afforded to these elements within Benthamite utilitarian thought. Thus the resolution of Mill's personal crisis is seen as shedding light on key limitations within the moral philosophy that he inherited from Bentham and from his father."
10.1017/s0031819100039802,Philosophy and Corruption of Language,"Most people are acquainted with the abuse of language that is involved in political propaganda. They accept that even in the best of times politicians aim, in part, to deceive their listeners, to put a good face on the worst of failures, to play down the successes of their opponents. In a general way, political language aims to guide people's perceptions of conditions and events in a way that is favourable to the interests of a politician and his party, interests which may or may not be consistent with the interest of his listeners. Such language is not meant to engender consideration of issues, but rather to free them from the burden of consideration. In the worst of times there is little or no interest in the fidelity between a speaker and his words and between words and things. The accuracy of language is abandoned in favour of its effect; truth is subordinated to ambition."
10.1017/s0031819100064445,Philosophy and Literature,"My writing is simply a set of experiments in life—an endeavour to see what our thought and emotion may be capable of—what stores of motive, actual or hinted as possible, give promise of a better after which we may strive—what gains from past revelations and discipline we must strive to keep hold of as something more than shifting theory. I became more and more timid—with less daring to adopt any formula which does not get itself clothed for me in some human figure and individual experience, and perhaps that is a sign that if I help others to see at all it must be through the medium of art.George Eliot.In his inaugural lecture, given in Birkbeck College in 1987, Roger Scruton, who has done as much as anyone else in recent years to bring the importance of art in general and literature in particular to the attention of philosophers, contends that ‘philosophy severed from literary criticism is as monstrous a thing as literary criticism severed from philosophy’. The first, he argues, aims to be science: strives after theoretical truth which it can never attain; and results in banality clothed in pseudo-scientific technicalities: while the second is liable to find consolation in the kind of nonsense which pretends that in the study of literature we are confronted with nothing other than an author-less, unreadable, ‘text’. Philosophy, he maintains, ‘must return aesthetics to the place that Kant and Hegel made for it: a place at the centre of the subject, the paradigm of philosophy and the true test of all its claims’."
10.1017/s0031819100053043,The Art of Philosophy,"Any account of knowledge has to take account both of the contribution of the world and the contribution of man. Every human endeavour, every activity, every art, every science is a product of a unique interaction between man and the world. Where man is most passive, he merely reflects and reports the world; this is pure discovery, if it ever exists. Where man is most active, the world's contribution lies merely in the provision of the raw material; this is pure invention, if it ever exists. All the arts, all the sciences can be ordered in a continuous array or spectrum ranging from pure discovery to pure invention. That they are all at some point on this continuum gives them a common but fragile thread, justifying our thinking and talking of the unity of the arts and sciences. Philosophy is neither pure discovery nor pure invention; it bears resemblances to both a science and an art. In this paper I propose to try to give reasons why we should regard the philosopher as an artist and philosophy as an art; or, at any rate, I shall try to show that there is an Art of Philosophy."
10.1017/s0031819100044715,Narrative in African Philosophy,"P. O. Bodunrin, in his 1981 essay, asks: ‘Is there an African Philosophy, and if there is, what is it?’ This question has occupied centre stage among younger African intellectuals for about a decade now. The most articulate among these intellectuals, who are themselves philosophers, are Bodunrin (Nigeria), Kwasi Wiredu (Ghana), H. Odera Oruka (Kenya), Marcien Towa and Eboussi Boulaga (Cameroon), and Paulin Hountondji (Benin). These philosophers among others are in dialogue with one another and currently are seen to be the principal architects of a new orientation in African thought."
10.1017/s0031819100064251,Chesterton's Philosophy of Education,"‘Every education teaches a philosophy; if not by dogma then by suggestion, by implication, by atmosphere. Every part of that education has a connection with every other part. If it does not all combine to convey some general view of life it is not education at all’ (Chesterton).In an essay written for the thirtieth volume of theBritish Journal of Educational Studies, R. F. Dearden surveyed philosophy of education during the period 1952–82. As might be imagined he was largely concerned with the emergence in and development through these years of analytical philosophy of education, as the influence of linguistic or conceptual analysis spread beyond the somewhat ill-defined boundaries of core philosophy and was taken up by those interested in the theoretical presuppositions of educational practice. After charting the course of this development, and having reached the point at which certain worries arose about the limits of conceptual analysis as a method, Dearden turned to consider what if any alternatives might be available. The first possibility which he mentions in expectation of its having received explicit articulation is Catholic philosophy of education. However, as he notes, nothing meeting this description was developed during the period in question—in effect, since the war. The one book which he mentions, viz. Jacques Maritain'sEducation at the Crossroads, is barely known of in professional philosophy of education and in style and content is quite out of the mainstream."
10.1017/s0031819100040468,Philosophy and its History,"The claim that philosophy and its history are two distinct, though interrelated, things would probably seem allmost people who have any idea of what philosophy is, to be so obviously true that it would be foolish or perverse to call it in question. Do we not assume, and rightly, that there is a real distinction between art and the history of art, between science and the history of science? Is there not also a real distinction between philosophy and history of philosophy? Artistic creation and telling the story of the development of the arts through the centuries are clearly not the same thing, though there is an obvious relationship between them. Similarly, the actual process of scientific inquiry and formulating scientific hypotheses and theories is not the same thing as recounting the genesis of such hypotheses and theories. Again, it hardly needs saying that there is a difference between Kant's original creative development of his philosophy and the activity of providing even a sympathetic and illuminating interpretative account of Kant's thought."
10.1017/s0031819100043345,Philosophy and Common Sense,"This paper raises once more the question of the relationship between philosophy on the one hand and common sense on the other. More particularly, it is concerned with the role which common sense can play in passing judgment on the rational acceptability (or otherwise) of large-scale hypotheses in natural philosophy and the cosmological part of metaphysics. There are, as I see it, three stages through which the relationship has passed in the course of the twentieth century. There is the era of G. E. Moore, the Quine–Feyerabend period, and now a new and modest vindication of common sense is emerging in the work of Jerry Fodor."
10.1017/s0031819100038584,Philosophy in a Developing Country,"Philosophy as an academic programme is very young in higher institutions of learning in Nigeria. Third World developing countries usually have concerns other than the teaching of philosophy on their agenda when trying to disburse their meagre resources for the educational sector. They would want to clothe, feed, house and provide medical care for their teeming populations first, and then people who want to T philosophize can do so. So their priority in the area of education is not I for people who will split hairs over words and concepts and theorise about lofty ideals—the popular image of the philosopher—but for the training of agriculturalists, technicians, doctors, engineers and others who can contribute much more tangibly to the development process. For this reason, many people regard a department of philosophy in a university as a luxury item which developing countries can ill afford. For this reason too, the philosophy department, usually the latest arrival in its faculty, is added as an appendix and is the first to be eyed when a scraping becomes necessary in the face of reduced subvention to the institution."
10.1017/s0031819100019574,How to be Sceptical about Philosophy,"Alasdair Maclntyre and Richard Rorty agree (or at least seem to agree) on two very fundamental matters, namely, to put it in Rorty's words, (1) ‘that philosophy as practised professionally today lacks any systematic unity’ and (2) that this very fact poses for us now, standing where we stand, ‘a central philosophical problem’.1 (I say ‘at least seem to agree’ because Maclntyre actually puts the matter hypothetically, but I believe this is a stylistic matter only.2) It is also true that they both have a much more historicist view of philosophy than does traditional analytic philosophy; they regard (pace Quine and Reichenbach) the study of the history of philosophy as an integral element in the study of philosophy and think that philosophy is not something to be sharply separated, as a distinct discipline, from other areas of learning."
10.1017/s0031819100068169,Moral Issues and Social Problems: The Moral Relevance of Moral Philosophy,"At the beginning of one of his inimitable discourses William James once said, ‘I am only a philosopher, and there is only one thing that a philosopher can be relied on to do, and that is, to contradict other philosophers’.1In his succeeding discourse James himself departed from this theme. And so shall I. I shall not be contradicting other philosophers—at least not very often. What I aim to do is to take a fresh look at one of the main traditions in American philosophy for insight and illumination on a way of dealing with some of the most serious issues of our time. But before I turn to that, my main theme, I want to pursue for a bit some variations on another, the cultural relevance of philosophy, for, as I view the matter, they are related."
10.1017/s0031819100069928,System and Theory in Philosophy,"What is systematic in philosophy is its description of the world we inhabit. ‘Philosophers boast’, said Whitehead, ‘that they uphold no system. They are then a prey to the delusive clarities of detached expressions whichit is the very purpose of their science to surmount’. We need not accept Whitehead's comparison of ‘speculative philosophy’ with the systemof naturalsciences to take his point. The philosophical description of the world issystematic since ‘detached expressions’ may delude us; ‘detached’, that is, in lying outside ‘a coherent, logical, necessary system of generalideas’; we lack a conviction that they have an application toanyelement of our experience, which the members of a system possess, according to Whitehead, in characterizing every element. What is the nature of this system of description?"
10.1017/s0031819100068686,Philosophy and Philosophies,"People who approach philosophy, as it figures in the activities of mostEnglish-speaking universities, often find their expectations curiously wideof the mark. They have expectations, of course, because the word ‘philosophy’ is not a technical term; there is no need to have taken any exams to use it happily enough in general conversation."

10.1017/s0031819100063579,Kant's Political Philosophy,"These comments on Professor Gallie's paper, ‘Kant's View of Reason in Politics’ (PhilosophyJanuary 1979) are focused on a particular issue, and I shall explain at the outset what it is and why I have concentrated on it. Gallie's account of the details of Kant's political philosophy and his specific comments on them strike me as interesting and reasonable and I have, therefore, little to add. Instead I want to question Gallie's assumptions about, and dissatisfactions with, the philosophic framework on which Kant's political philosophy rests. There is, firstly, his complaint that reason is insufficiently defined (p. 23) though he takes a somewhat more positive view later. There is, secondly, his claim that Kant's moral philosophy is inferior to his epistemology (i.e. ‘less original, less illuminating, less architectonic’, p. 24). On these points Gallie is, in my view, not convincing and not even completely clear. Without disagreeing totally with Gallie's assessments—still less claiming that Kant is invariably right—I want to argue that Kant's conclusions are formidably supported by, and can best be understood in terms of, his own arguments. To me the question about the cogency of his case is more interesting than the details of his political philosophy. How rational are, in fact, his conclusions? So, at the risk of covering some familiar ground, I want to stress some of the general features of Kant's philosophy and argue, in particular, that his political philosophy is based on and, in turn, supplements, his moral one. The latter seems to me to be as intricate, interesting and fruitful as his epistemology and exhibits a similar architectonic. (This would also account for the parallel between the roles of reason in politics and knowledge on which Gallie comments (p. 28).)"
10.1017/s0031819100018751,Fifty Years of Philosophy and Philosophers,The foundation of the (now Royal) Institute of Philosophy coincided with my own entry into the ranks of academic philosophers. It may therefore on this special occasion be of some interest if I cast some retrospective glances at philosophy's daily life in and after the middle 1920s. I shall not steal from the proper hands the task of sketching the history of the Royal Institute itself; but I have some now fairly rare qualifications for describing the philosophical world into which it was born.
10.1017/s0031819100019999,"Truth, Happiness and Obligation: the Moral Philosophy of William Wollaston","William Wollaston, a leading British moral philosopher of the eighteenth century, has fallen into obscurity primarily, I believe, for two reasons. In the first place, it is usually supposed that Wollaston's moral theory was refuted by Hume in the opening section of the third book of theTreatise of Human Nature. Secondly, Wollaston's theory, or parts thereof, have been assigned pejorative labels such as ‘odd’ and ‘strange’, which create the impression that it is not a moral philosophy which can be taken seriously. In this paper I attempt to deal with the second of these reasons by setting forth what I take to be Wollaston's meaning in certain key sections of his work,The Religion of Nature Delineated, especially in so far as they help to shed light on his theories of truth and happiness, and the relation of these to his theory of obligation. Wollaston will be found to be a moral philosopher with important things to say, and therefore to be a moral philosopher with a theory worth taking seriously. If I am correct in my interpretation of Wollaston, then it can also be established that Hume has not refuted Wollaston in the opening section of Book III of theTreatise. But here my attention will be confined entirely to Wollaston's own moral theory."
10.1017/s0031819100025158,Understanding and Experience: Recent Work in the Philosophy of Mind,"The ways in which mental concepts can seem problematic are various, and consequently the idea of a coherent body of issues forming one part of philosophy, namely the philosophy of mind, is highly misleading. When Ludwig Wittgenstein and Gilbert Ryle inaugurated the flood of recent writings about the concept of mind there was some similarity, although not identity, in the problems which led them to concentrate their attention on mental concepts. Wittgenstein saw that lack of clarity about such notions as willing, thinking, feeling and imagining generated powerful but misleading pictures about logic—about the difference between sense and nonsense —so that if we were to become clear about one we should have to become clear about the other. Worries about logic generated his interest in what it is to have a mind. In the case of Ryle, if we are to accept his own autobiographical remarks, an exposition of the logic of mental concepts was undertaken to illustrate whatever clarity had already been achieved by him and others with regard to logic and logical investigations. ‘The Concept of Mindwas a philosophical book written with a meta-philosophical purpose’ (Gilbert Ryle, ‘Autobiographical’, inRyle: A Collection of Critical Essays, edited by Oscar P. Wood and George Pitcher, 1970). Although I think it should be open for speculation just why specifically mental notions were singled out by him for such an illustrative purpose. In each case questions about logic prompted writing about the mind. There remains an echo of this in some of the books under review, but, as often with deepseated changes, the original impetus can soon be lost, and debates about distinctions in which it was first embodied can take on a life of their own."
10.1017/s0031819100061027,Kant's Philosophy of Religion,It was in 1792 that Kant published the first Book of his most important single work on the philosophy of religion—Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone. But it was his very interesting treatment of the biblical material in the second Book that involved the philosopher in his one serious conflict with official authority. Greene and Hudson give a good account of this conflict and its effect on the work as a whole in the introduction to their translation ofReligionin the Harper Torchbook Series (1960).
10.1017/s0031819100059064,Philosophy and Mr Stoppard,"Few stage plays have much to do with analytic philosophy: Tom Stoppard has written two of them—Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are DeadandJumpers. The contrast between these, especially in how they involve philosophy, could hardly be greater.Rosencrantzdoes not parade its philosophical content; but the philosophy is there all the same, and it is solid, serious and functional. In contrast with this, the philosophy which is flaunted throughoutJumpersis thin and uninteresting, and it serves the play only in a decorative and marginal way. Its main effect has been to induce timidity in reviewers who could not see the relevance to the play of the large stretches of academic philosophy which it contains. Since the relevance doesn't exist, the timidity was misplaced, and so the kid gloves need not have been used. Without doubting that I would have enjoyed the work as performed on the London stage, aided by the talent of Michael Hordern and the charm of Diana Rigg, I don't doubt either thatJumpersis a poor effort which doesn't deserve its current success. I shan't argue for that, however. I want only to explain whyJumpersis not a significantly philosophical play, before turning to the more important and congenial task of showing thatRosencrantz and Guildenstern are Deadis one."
10.1017/s0031819100060599,"The Concept of Beastliness: Philosophy, Ethics and Animal Behaviour","Every age has its pet contradictions. Thirty years ago, we used to accept Marx and Freud together, and then wonder, like the chameleon on the tartan, why life was so confusing. Today there is similar trouble over the question whether there is, or is not, something called Human Nature. On the one hand, there has been an explosion of animal behaviour studies, and comparisons between animals and men have become immensely popular. People use evidence from animals to decide whether man is naturally aggressive, or naturally territorial; even whether he has an Aggressive or Territorial Instinct. On the other hand, many sociologists and psychologists still seem to hold the Behaviourist view that man is a creature entirely without instincts, and so do existentialist philosophers. If so, all comparison with animals must be irrelevant. (To save space, I have had to simplify both these party lines here, but if anyone thinks I am oversimplifying the behaviourist one, I can only ask him to keep on readingNew Society). On that view, man is entirely the product of his culture. He starts off infinitely plastic, and is formed completely by the society in which he grows up."
10.1017/s0031819100055959,J. S. Mill's Political Philosophy of Mind,"That freedom involves a power (or right) to choose is a natural idea. But it requires a model of man which English philosophers have usually rejected. It requires an agent equipped with a will, who is faced with genuine alternatives and is, in some sense, autonomous. So it is rejected both by those, like Hobbes, who hold a strong version of determinism and by those, like Hume, who deny the existence of an autonomous self. The will, says Hobbes, is simply ‘the last appetite in deliberating’. A mind, says Hume, is ‘nothing but a heap or collection of different perceptions, united together by certain relations’. The way is then apparently open for a denial that men ever act freely at all and so for a thoroughly deterministic basis for the social sciences. But this is not the usual conclusion. Hobbes and Hume both agree that there is no conflict between freedom and determinism, once ‘freeedom’ is properly understood. A man is free when he can get what he wants. As Hobbes puts it, ‘liberty is the absence of all impediments to action which are not contained in the nature and intrinsical quality of the agent’. In other words freedom does not involve choice but consists instead in the power to satisfy desire."
10.1017/s003181910002430x,Adam Smith's Philosophy of Riches,"In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century the name of Adam Smith was popularly associated with the sort of ‘laissez faire’ policy that is expounded with all the fervour of a religious faith. Smith, so the story ran, in his eagerness to combat the excessive mercantilist government intervention of his day, had resorted to supra-natural claims in his general onslaught against central control and planning by governments. Such intervention was ‘unnatural’ and conflicted with Deistic Design. Only through private actions could mankind reach satisfying and ‘natural’ fulfillment. Action through private self-interest was twice blessed; it. blessed him who profited and his fellows who were ‘profited from’. True therewasa kind of central planning that was of supreme importance; but it had a divine origin and it worked not through governments but through individual free trade. Private actions in fact were directed by an Invisible Hand which brought society into a grand and spontaneous Natural Harmony."
10.1017/s0031819100058526,"The ‘Body-Mind Problem’ in Philosophy, Psychology and Medicine","There is a story about a distinguished mathematician who had been invited to deliver a course of advanced lectures to other high-powered students of mathematics on a subject about which he was known to have some original ideas. The course, however, got off to a slow start. He devoted three lectures to discussing whether a certain propositionPwas or was not self evident. The propositionPwas essential to the argument he wanted to develop. Happily, he was able to announce at the opening of his fourth lecture that he had decided thatP wasself evident. There was an audible sigh of relief. It was now known, on the highest authority, thatPwas self evident. From that the argument proceeded briskly and with irresistible logic to the lecturer's surprising and devastating conclusions."
10.1017/s0031819100055212,The Philosophy Of J. F. Ferrier,"James Frederick Ferrier was born in Edinburgh on June 16th, 1808. He was educated privately and at the Royal High School, Edinburgh. After spending two sessions at Edinburgh University, he entered Magdalen College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1831. Returning to Edinburgh, he qualified as an advocate in 1832, but devoted himself to philosophical studies, largely as a result of his close friendship with Sir William Hamilton. In 1838-9, he publishedAn Introduction to the Philosophy of Consciousness in Blackwood's Magazine. This was followed by a number of interesting articles and reviews, chiefly on sense-perception. In 1844, Ferrier deputised for SirWilliam Hamilton in the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics at Edinburgh, and, in the following year, he became Professor of Moral Philosophy and Politica Economy in St Andrews. In 1854, he publishedThe Institutes of Metaphysics. He died in 1864, leaving behind him a valuable course ofLectures on Greek Philosophy, which was published posthumously."
10.1017/s0031819100059908,Philosophy In The Soviet Union,"Soviet philosophy has no great reputation in the Western philosophical world. Physicists, mathematicians, geographers and geomorphologists, medical scientists and men working in certain branches of history and linguistics have found it profitable to follow the researches of their Soviet counterparts; philosophers have not. Academician Mitin, it is true, told the Soviet Academy of Sciences early in 1943 that ’philosophy has been raised to an unparalleled level in the Soviet Union, making the U.S.S.R. a country ofhigh philosophical culture. Many problems which are being argued by outstanding philosophers abroad have been solved here on the basis of dialectical materialism.”1To most non-Communists, Mitin's claim"
10.1017/s0031819100058009,Hägerström's Philosophy of Law,"In what it will be convenient to call “the Scandinavian school”; of jurisprudence, Hagerstrom is clearly the master. But his leadership is of a somewhat special kind. For all that he wrote a large book on Roman law, Hägerström was trained as, and continued to be, a philosopher, not a jurisprudentialist or a sociologist. His essays on law and morals are ancillary to his main purpose: to destroy transcendental metaphysics. The epigraphhe chose tohead his contribution toDie Philosophic der Gegenwart in Selbstdarstellungenwas uncom-promising: “Praeterea censeo metaphysicam esse delendam.” If, in his published work, he to so considerable a degree concentrated his attention on ethics and jurisprudence, that is because he took them to be a particularly rich source of metaphysical mystery-mongering. Through a study of men's moral and legal ideas, Hägerström thought he could bring out the sources, the defects—and even, in a way, the strength—of metaphysical thinking."
10.1017/s0031819100059726,Two Conceptions of Philosophy,"In the summer of 1921 the newspapers in this country carried long reports of a Conference of Modern Churchmen at Cambridge. Many of the contributions to their proceedings were unorthodox; they resulted from an historical and philosophical approach to the New Testament and certain fundamental Christian doctrines. There was nothing particularly new to scholars in all that was said, but the eminence of some of the speakers, their intellectual distinction, and their outspokenness created a public sensation. It looked almost as if the Modernist movement which had been stifled in the Roman Church were advancing in the Anglican."
10.1017/s0031819100030928,German Philosophy,"Bridging the gulf between East and West, between developed and underdeveloped countries, between white and coloured races, between the six and the seven, has become a cluster of urgent political problems which have to be solved if disaster is to be avoided. All these problems have ideological implications since the antagonisms are based on different beliefs, ideas, prejudices, theories, and philosophies. Bridging the gap between antagonistic philosophies may strike the politician as being of minor importance, but may, nevertheless, in certain cases be a considerable help."
10.1017/s0031819100057855,Philosophy and Poetry,"Professor Brett has some direct acquaintance with a Joint Honours Degree in English Literature and Philosophy: and it is therefore on the basis of his own experience (as well as Coleridge's) that he warns us that poetry and philosophy are “difficult pursuits for any man to combine” (p. 79). This book has an introductory chapter and a short epilogue which deal in a philosophical way with meaning in poetry and in imaginative literature generally and with the nature of critical interpretation.In the four middle chapters the author gives his account of four well-known and much discussed poems:Lycidas, the Essay on Man, the Ancient Mariner and the Four Quartets. One could imagine these chapters presented independently as interpretations and discussions of the literary and historical background of the poems: but they certainly illustrate Mr. Brett's theory of meaning in poetry and this provides a certain unity. Parts of Chapter I were first published by the author inPhilosophy(July 1952). What is new is the particular application of the theory to didactic and discursive poetry. To this is now added a discussion of rival theories of interpretation: first, the view expressed by Wimsatt and Beardsley in “The Intentional Fallacy” (Sewanee Review, 1946 and 1949); and, second, the views expressed by Miss Kathleen Raine in her essay on Blake (British Book News, Supplement, 1951)."
10.1017/s0031819100042947,Philosophical Survey: Philosophy in France,"Only one volume has reached us to mark the centenary of Bergson's birth. Is this significant? If a writer lives to an advanced age his centenary usually falls at a time when fashion has turned against him, and the consequent attitudes are perhaps more interestingly gleaned from comparitively informal assessments than from carefully timed publications. In theNouvelles Littérairesof October 22,1959, there appeared, almost a hundred years to the day after Bergson's birth, a reported discussion on his philosophy between Gaston Berger, Gabriel Marcel, Henri Gouhier, Jean Brun and a young “normalien” Dominique Janicaud.The talk, presumably more or less spontaneous, was naturally desultory. The older participants could always compensate for implicit misgivings by falling back on affectionate personal recollections, and the youngest would perhaps have preferred not to have to say anything at all. The most cogent general estimate was probably M. Jean Brun's, when he described Bergson as in effect making a stand against the danger of specialist appropriation of the dismembered fragments of philosophy by the various branches of science. We have seen this very nearly come about in England, where a fairly narrow linguistic and logical sector alone has been held with any feeling of conviction. What is here exemplified is the difference of outlook on any question that the English Channel makes. I once heard an English professor of English literature say that when reading Emile Legouis'History of English Literaturehe had some difficulty in persuading himself that his own professional speciality was being dealt with. It is not difficult to see how this comes about. What one nation takes for granted appears to another as excitingly significant."
10.1017/s0031819100039279,"Notes on Philosophy, January 1960","The article on my theory of descriptions by Mr. Lejewski raises two points. One is as to the copula. I do not quite understand why it is thought that an ambiguity in the meaning of the word “is” is relevant in regard to my theory of descriptions. There are many problems in regard to which it is relevant. I have mentioned one of these in criticizing Hegel inOur Knowledge of the External Worldon p. 39nof the original edition (1914). But, although I have read Mr. Lejewski's argument several times, it still seems to me quite clear that in “Scott is the author of Waverley” the “is” is that of identity. Nor have I been able to understand why he considers his theory of descriptions preferable to mine. I am, however, quite willing to believe (and I say this in all sincerity) that there is some point that I have missed in his discussion."
10.1017/s0031819100039280,Philosophy of Science and Analysis,"Robert Oppenheimer tells the story about a group of Bible scholars who practised exegesis with grim determination.

Answered one Bible student: “Indeed—but what we do not understand we explain to one another.”"
10.1017/s0031819100038262,Generalization In The Philosophy Of Art,"If we ask what are the problems which have to be dealt with when the subject of art is being discussed in a philosophical manner, we shall no doubt receive a variety of answers: but there will be in one respect a considerable measure of agreement, viz. that the main problem consists in discovering (a) what is the common property in all works of art which distinguishes them from things that are not works of art, and (b) what is the common property in all good works of art which distinguishes them from bad or mediocre ones. Certainly an immense amount of labour has in the past been devoted to this purpose. Recent philosophical practice, however, has implied some dissatisfaction with this type of approach, and the purpose of this article is to try to show that the dissatisfaction is justified."
10.1017/s0031819100055054,Contemporary British Philosophy,"Before taking this book with the seriousness which at least parts of it deserve,itis necessary to dispose of a criticism which is basically frivolous but has already been made too often to be ignored. “Contemporary British Philosophy”—the title conjures up the names that everyone is currently bandying about (“this is going to be another Flew book,” you feel, “only on a grand scale”); and then you find with a jolt that you are being served with fare by such cooks as Ewing, Findlay, Kneale, Mabbott, Price, and—of all people—Paton. People, clearly, who for the most part wouldn’t even pretend to be “contemporary” in the ordinary use of this word, and who indeed in these very papers subject thereal“contemporary” philosophers to endless sniping and sharp-shooting. Almost the only contributor one can imaginewishingto be thought “contemporary” is Ryle; and even he—well, did Freud really think of himself as a Freudian? Ayer might be put up as another exception, but that would be shallow— there's no one so completely and hopelessly out of date as the conductor of the bandwagon that's just gone past. Even from the point of view of crass physical age, the baby of this bunch (Hampshire), works out (from the biographies at the back) at about 43."
10.1017/s0031819100055066,German Philosophy,"Encounter is one of the magical keywords of our time which seems to open up new vistas. Rencontre, Encounter, Begegnung, the Festschrift dedicated to Professor F. J. J. Buytendijk (Spectrum, Utrecht) is noteworthy for several reasons. First, the meanings of the three terms are by no means identical. In encounter the negative sense “meet in a hostile manner”, prevails in Begegnung the affirmative sense, whereas rencontre is neutral and can be used in both senses. Secondly, whereas Festschriften tend to become a nuisance, occasionally arranged by the recipients ad majorem auctoris gloriam, this one is well-deserved and well-arranged. Buytendijk is a leading Dutch biologist, physiologist and psychologist of European stature with an excellent resistance record. Since the contributors were asked to refer to his paper, La phénoménologie de la rencontre (Eranos Jahrbuch, XIX, 1950), the most important papers are contributions to a psychology of rencontre. Thus the volume becomes representative of an important trend in European biology and psychology. The collaboration of biologists, psychologists and psychiatrists with philosophers is exemplary and fruitful. A non-behaviourist and non-materialist experimental psychology, a personalist counterpart to a behaviourist stimulus-response psychology, emerges in outlines. It has transcended the isolated individual and isolated impressions and ideas, and regards man as a being-within-the-world together with other persons. the influence of Husserl's phenomenology and of Heidegger's Sein und Zeit is outstanding. New categories are used, such as “authentic” and “inauthentic” rencontre, and new problems arise, e.g. the smiling of a child interpreted as a primitive mode of rencontre (M. Chastaing, K. Goldstein), and that of “Se fermer et s’ouvrir” (H. C. Rumke). It is quite impossible to discuss here single contributions. It must suffice to say that they confirm Buytendijk's central conception that somehow mind is already present within the organism, and that on the other hand, blind necessity penetrates human affairs."
10.1017/s0031819100061507,Philosophy and Quantum Physics,"The conceptual problems raised by the discovery of quantum effects have not been fully resolved after half a century. Part of the reason for this is undoubtedly to be found in the mutual ignorance which prevails between physicists and philosophers. In his book Heisenberg brings together a philosophically inclined temperament with an unrivalled knowledge of physics. The result is a book of very great interest, however much one might disagree with his conclusions. The collection of essays of which the other book is made up is intended to bring crucial conceptual problems in physics especially to the notice of philosophers. The design and intention of the collection is admirable for this is the proper way to overcome the departmentalization of interest that has left the deep conceptual problems still unresolved. Men like Heisenberg who combine philosophical temperament with scientic knowledge of great distinction are rare, and yet the difficulties can only be cleared up by the application of philosophical techniques of analysis to problems which are an intimate and difficult part of physics."
10.1017/s0031819100061520,German Philosophy,"Die Atombombe und die Zukunft des Menschen(R. Piper, München) is the topical title of Karl Jaspers's latest book. His intention is excellent, he wants to arouse the conscience of man in face of the deadly danger of atomic warfare. It would be most interesting to compare this book of more than 500 pages with Bertrand Russell's corresponding short publications which concentrate on practical proposals. In order to do justice to Jaspers the English reader should, however, keep in mind that the author had to overcome formidable obstacles. His subtitle,Politisches Bewusstsein in unserer Zeit, indicates that he does not only wish to discuss the present dangerous situation and the means for mastering it, but also to lay the foundation of a Political Philosophy. But here he is faced with two brute facts. First, the Germans are almost by nature un political and falsify by their existence a famous Aristotelian dictum. Their political sense or instinct is, for complex psychological and historical reasons, underdeveloped; a fact which is, paradoxically, of great political importance. Secondly, a German Political Philosophy in the Anglo-American sense does not exist; it forms part of theRechts-und Staatsphilosopie(cf. Hegel'sPhilosophie des Rechts, which should not be translated asPhilosophy of Right) or of sociological studies. Consequently, Jaspers has to construct his Political Philosophy on the basis of his own Philosophy of Existence, an interesting experiment, beset with formidable difficulties. Here again he remains the gliding philosopher (der schwebende Philosoph), whose analysis of our political predicament moves in “possible perspectives” so that in the end everything remains in suspense (Es bleibt alles in der Schwebe). Indeed, Jaspers holds that rationally atomic warfare cannot be eliminated and that the total destruction of mankind is probable. He therefore appeals to every human being for a radical change of heart which alone could avert the disaster. This change of the “essence of man” remains a Utopian hope. Nevertheless, Jaspers is right in appealing to everybody's conscience. He confirms, moreover, that his existentialism cannot provide the basis for a Political Philosophy."
10.1017/s0031819100037219,Philosophy in France,"It need occasion no surprise thatRecherche de la Libertéby Daniel Christoff (P.U.F.) 1957, 220 pp., is devoted to philosophy of value. Freedom, one wants to say in this sort of context, is the attribute or even the essence of, for example, Sartre'spour soi; but since such a description would be, in existentialist language, a contradiction in terms, freedom had better be identified with the means whereby the dynamic self escapes from its essence, as Sartre would say. Because of this dynamic role of freedom in Continental philosophy it is natural that M. Christoff should be happier talking of liberation than of liberty. The word liberation refers to the process of value-making, and perhaps it is chosen in order that such question-begging terms as “creation of values” may be avoided. Question-begging because, although M. Christoff is by no means an exponent of the “objectivist” theory of values, he does not play down the importance of the concept in the interest of what is strictly never done but always in process of being done. He denies that rational thinking is “an immobile system of concepts”, and sees an alternation (presumably “dialectical”) of conceptualization and valuation as the activity of mind. It is not only in his view of liberty as liberation that M. Christoff reminds one of Lavelle and Gabriel Marcel, but also in his particular brand of altruism. He seems to see Sartre's point of view about “others” without sharing it."
10.1017/s0031819100038420,Philosophy In France,"A newcomer to the writing of this survey quickly learns (though not quite quickly enough for his first venture) that they do not serve who only sit and wait. The expectation, in other words, that the year's major books of French philosophy will arrive unsolicited, is not fulfilled. Instead one is faced with a miscellaneous set of publications covering such varied topics as Jewish mysticism, cybernetics and a translation from Spanish of a primer of political economy. I must therefore beg readers to be indulgent enough to pay for my first lesson, promising them that henceforth I shall bestir myself and forage."
10.1017/s0031819100029703,British Philosophy in the Mid-Century,"In the summer of 1953 a lecture-course organized by the British Council was given at Peterhouse, Cambridge. The Faculty of Moral Science were responsible for the programme of lectures and discussions, and Miss Margaret Master man and Dr. Theodore Red path were appointed by the Faculty as joint directors. The lectures must have been well received by the teachers of philosophy who attended and participated in the discussions— representatives from the Continent, the United States and even China were on hand; and the suggestion arose quite naturally that they be published in a single volume. However, some of the lecturers wished to redraft the papers they had read and hence the essays now presented, under the editorship of C. A. Mace, in the volumeBritish Philosophy in the Mid-Century, A Cambridge Symposium(George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1957) are in a number of instances dressed up and greatly expanded versions of the lectures actually given. Further, it is worth noting that the essay by G. E. Moore was written specifically for this volume and is based on a discussion held with some students who attended the sessions at Peterhouse. Thus it is that the papers now published vary greatly in length from the welcome ten pages contributed by G. E. Moore to the seventy-nine pages from Miss Master man. This disparity is, of course, an anomaly in a volume explicitly designed to reflect trends in very recent British philosophy and to convey, to those relatively unfamiliar with it, some reliable picture of its condition at mid-century. But this volume records a present-day Cambridge symposium and as such it must in some measure reflect quite local interests and conditions. However, most of the contributors are very well known and the essays now presented to the public contain a good deal that will interest and profit the reader."
10.1017/s0031819100029715,Philosophy in the New Britannica,"“The pattern is new,” T. S. Eliot has written, “at every moment”: for our past and the history of our culture forms a pattern for us, and each new step that we take implies a revaluation of all that has gone before. Professional philosophers are no longer much given to sayings of this sort; they leave it to poets to make them. Yet surely if these words apply anywhere they apply to the history of Philosophy. A new philosophy or a new position in Philosophy, genuinely new, involves the adoption of different categories, a new orientation; it involves the re-writing of its history and a changed outlook on a whole landscape of problems. The perspective is altered, we find; the masses re-group themselves and the relations fall differently into place."
10.1017/s0031819100051949,The Philosophy Of Vladimir Jankélévitch,"Vladimir JankéLéVitch, who teaches philosophy at the Sorbonne, is one of the most highly individual philosophical writers in France today. He has been publishing books for some quarter of a century on both philosophy and music, of which the most recent, entitledLa Rhapsodie: Verve et improvisation musicale, unites his two specialities. It is with his philosophical work that I want to deal here."
10.1017/s0031819100051974,German Philosophy,"The old guard still dominates the German scene. Jaspers leads with three publications, the monumental new volume of P. A. Schilpp'sLibrary of Living Philosopherswhich appears first in German asKarl Jaspers(W. Kohl-hammer, Stuttgart); the third edition of hisPhilosophiein three volumes with an important “Postscript 1956” (Springer, Berlin); and the second edition of hisExistenzphilosophiealso with a new postscript explaining the situation in which these lectures arose (De Gruyter, Berlin). These volumes offer an opportunity for re-examining his philosophy, and are indeed used by himself for this purpose and therefore indispensable to any serious student of his thought. The Schilpp volume naturally offers the greatest amount of new material with its twenty-four contributors who have more or less succeeded in discussing a philosophy of pure reflexion without specific doctrines. They allow Jaspers to clarify his thought, especially concerning the problems of existential communication (in reply to Fritz Kaufmann's elaborate and penetrating defence of a more general theory), of psychology, history and politics."
10.1017/s0031819100051688,Contemporary Empiricism And The Philosophy Of Religion,"Therehas been a very lively renewal of interest in religion of late, especially among intellectuals. The part which philosophers take in this is reflected in a number of popular discussions of religion by philosophers, in radio talks and symposia, conferences on the philosophy of religion, as well as in subtle contributions to learned journals. The reasons for this interest in religion are many, but prominent among them is the peculiar position of philosophy today. As is well known, the dominant strain in philosophy, in English–speaking countries at present, is a severely empiricist one, and this has as one of its most distinctive features the technique by which it is claimed to show that assertions which seem to be of a non–empirical character, other than strictly logical or mathematical ones, gain their apparent plausibility through linguistic confusions of various kinds, notably our proneness to hypostatize abstractions. This development in philosophy has led to concern with religion in a number of very different ways, of which the following seem to be the most important."
10.1017/s003181910005169x,Religious Assertions In The Light Of Contemporary Philosophy,"Todaythe questions most commonly asked by philosophical critics of religion, at least in this country, relate not to the truth or falsity of religious assertions but to their meaning. To be fair to the philosophers, however, we must of course realize that very few, if any, of those who have denied “meaningfulness” to religious statements were using “meaning” in other than a technical sense. They did not mean that the sentence “God loves us” conveys nothing at all, that it is like “schwarzibarshinee.”"
10.1017/s0031819100046404,German Philosophy,"Operative Logic and Mathematics would appear to be a new venture. Only a few weeks before his premature death Hermann Weyl, one of the most original mathematicians of our time, the author of aPhilosophy of Mathematics and Natural Scienceand also of a stimulating book onSymmetry, drew my attention to Paul Lorenzen'sEinführung in die operative Logik und Mathematik(Springer, Berlin). This book had given him new hope, since GÖdel had discouraged his endeavour to find the foundations of mathematics.“Perhaps,” he added, “Lorenzen's approach promises a way of arriving at reliable foundations.”"
10.1017/s0031819100037566,German Philosophy,"The reputation and influence of an author depends to a large extent on the predilections of a specific society. One and the same person may be esteemed for different aspects of his work in various countries. Edmund Burke is chiefly known for his aesthetics on the continent, and not for his political philosophy as in this country. Georg Simmel, on the other hand, is famous on the continent foremost as a philosopher, but is known in the Anglo–Saxon world only as a sociologist. The Americans even speak of “Simmelism” meaning thereby a sociology analysing the psychological forms of social interaction such as conflict and subordination. The disregard of his philosophical work is a pity, for Simmel (1858–1918) was a most stimulating thinker, almost French in his style, a truly European mind belonging with Bergson, Croce and Ortega to a group of philosophical essayists who are the salt of the earth whatever the “scientific” philosophers may say against them. A collection of his essays referring to history, religion, art and society, published under the title Brücke und Tür (Koehler, Stuttgart, DM. 9.80) may be recommended as an introduction. It contains papers, most of them unpublished, of uneven value, but all are characteristic of the most dynamic philosopher I ever met. His thought arose in immediate response to anything which aroused his interest, be it an object (bridge, door), a person (Kant, Goethe, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Rodin) or a sociological fact (meal, metropolis)."
10.1017/s0031819100052207,Philosophy in France,"In fact, only one book on or around Marxism has been received for survey during the year that is past, though there are perhaps few British philosophers who would see anything for surprise or regret in that. Among the books not received, however, are two of very considerable interest and intelligence, which it would be wrong not to mention for the sake of anyone who may be unaware of their existence; Merleau Ponty'sLes aventures de la dialectiqueand Raymond Aron'sL’opium des intellectuels. Both books appeared at roughly the same time as a British critic was rash enough publicly to lament that political philosophy was dead in France. Quite apart from anything else, this seems an odd complaint of a country in which Marxism, be it for better or for worse, is very much a live intellectual influence. Classical Marxism may indeed be what Professor Acton calls “a philosophical farrago,” but it would be a bad mistake to treat it as no more than a dead doctrinal body, to be dissected and preserved, if at all, as simply an historical curiosity. What the intellectuals of the world’s next generation or two will be saying may be anybody's guess; but that a very large proportion of them will be saying it in Marxist or Marxist–derived terminology seems a safe prediction. When for any reason a certain vocabulary is placed beyond the bounds of critical questioning, all development must take the form of interpretation and application. But to say this is very different from saying that all development is brought to a halt."
10.1017/s0031819100066870,The Philosophy of Resemblances,This paper is a discussion and a criticism of the account of the Philosophy of Resemblances which appears in the first chapter of Professor H. H. Price'sThinking and Experience.
10.1017/s0031819100066894,"A Note On Professor Sir Henry Cohen’s Manson Lecture “The Status of Brain in the Concept of Mind,” Philosophy, July, 1952","ProfessorCohenmakes extensive reference to a lecture “Hypotheses relating to the brain-mind problem” which was published inNature(July 14th, 1951). He gives a succinct account of the suggestions that I put forward, and then goes on to state that they “illustrate two fallacies which are to be found in so many contributions to the study of the body-mind relationship.” Be that as it may, but Professor Cohen has chosen most unsuitable illustrations, for in both cases they are based on misunderstandings of my article."
10.1017/s0031819100036366,Philosophy In Italy,"About a year ago some important philosophical works were published in Italy which, both in the agreement and in the divergence of the trends they indicate, may be useful for characterizing the present situation of Italian philosophy. I think it opportune, therefore, for the information of the English reader, to give a fuller notice of these books than usual. One of them is by Ugo Spirito,La vita come amore(Life as love), with the subtitle “The downfall of Christian civilization ”(published by Sansoni, Florence, 1953). Ugo Spirito, who was one of the most intelligent and restless pupils of Giovanni Gentile, announced his secession from idealism in 1937.In that year he published a book entitledLa vita come ricerca(Life as quest), in which, as sole alternative to idealistic philosophy, henceforth considered untenable, he pointed to a philosophy of never concluded enquiry, which, while positing numerous problems, never solves them. The intention of the book was to conclude in the impossibility of philosophy as “system” or as “metaphysics”, on the supposition that all the possibilities of metaphysics had been exhausted in the course of its historical development, culminating in Gentile. In a certain sense this presupposition remains in the book now under examination; but here it is a question of defining positively the way that philosophy, and with it human life, ought to take, which is, according to Spirito, the way of love."
10.1017/s0031819100066286,Linguistic Philosophy and Perception,"Philosophical theories of perception are generally admitted to be responses to certain problems or puzzles allied to the ancient dichotomy between Appearance and Reality. For they have been mainly provoked by the incompatibility of the common–sense assumption that an external, physical world exists and is revealed to the senses with the well–known facts of perceptual variation and error. If only what is real were perceived just as if only what is right were done it is possible that many of those questions would never have been asked which lead to moral philosophy and a metaphysics of the external world. But sense perceptions of the same object vary so that it appears to have contradictory qualities and are sometimes completely deceptive. Nor do illusory differ internally from veridical perceptions. Moreover, perceptual variation and error can be unmasked only by such procedures as looking more carefully, listening harder, trying to touch, asking others, in short by more sense experience. So the senses are, as it were, both accused and judge in these disputes and why should a venal judge be trusted more than the criminal he tries? Such “correction” of one experience by another of the same kind seems no more reliable than the original “error.” Philosophers have found all this very puzzling."
10.1017/s0031819100059490,On the Philosophy of Hegel,"In asking me to talk about Hegel in your series on synoptic philosophies, I take it that you were anxious to discover whether there are any positive merits in Hegel's ideas. I need hardly remind you that such an approach to this particular philosopher is not a very common one in this country to-day. Indeed, of all those who have been thought, at one time or another, to have produced ideas of lasting philosophical importance, Hegel is at present easily the least in repute. Nor is it the case with him as with certain other writers (Spinoza, for instance, or some of the Scholastics) that his ideas are uninteresting or unintelligible to the present generation but are thought all the same to be likely to have an appeal and an importance at some future date when the general intellectual climate has changed; the common verdict on him is far less friendly than that. If opinions on the subject were canvassed among students of philosophy in Great Pritain to-day, there can be little doubt that the majority would write Hegel off as the supreme example of a philosopher who tried to construct an elaborate metaphysical system in the most blatantlya priorimanner, and who succeeded in getting himself taken seriously only because of his adroitness in verbal tricks."
10.1017/s0031819100034537,The Need For A Social Philosophy,"Some years ago a Belfast funeral undertaker was on holiday in County Down. One sunny evening he climbed to the highest point in the Ards Peninsula. The visibility was good and the view magnificent. On one side lay Strangford Lough with Slieve Croob and the Mourne Mountains in the background. On the other was the Irish Sea with the Isle of Man, the Cumberland Hills and the southern Scottish uplands in the distance."
10.1017/s0031819100019768,Psychiatric Prolegomena: A Plea for the Help of Philosophy,"Personality may be defined as “that aspect of human beings where by we are recognized by others, ” that is, “that which constitutes recog-nizability.” The term therefore implies a subject-object field in which the object is another person or persons. There exist as many criteria of personality assessment as there are significant viewpoints of human beings, but there seems little doubt that the human voice is that which impresses us most about our fellows, closely followed by facial expression. Both these convey that whereby we assess “purpose” which is a most important matter about which we habitually assess others."
10.1017/s0031819100019793,Philosophy in France,"It is not easy for an Englishman to acquire a competent knowledge of French philosophy. For one thing there are so many French philosophers writing so many books, and for another the multiplicity of men is matched by the variety of views. In a country where a knowledge of philosophy is expected of any cultivated man, and where the flourishing of philosophy in school and university curricula is regarded as a condition of intellectual freedom, this variety is accepted as part of the cultural background. Professor Bréhier'sTransformation de la Philosophie Française(Flammarion, Paris, 1950) must, even so, be of great value to French readers, because of the author's capacity-so admirably shown already in aHistory of Philosophythat is unquestionably the best now obtainable-to pick out what is essential in a welter of theories, arguments, and mere pronouncements. To English readers, whose knowledge of the background is necessarily limited, this book is particularly valuable, not only for the clarification it brings, but also for a bibliography that is closely related to the text. M. Bréhier observes that French philosophers of the generation that followed and criticized Durkheim, Bergson and Brunschwicg showed themselves acutely conscious of the discontinuities of things, and puritanically averse to the construction of philosophical systems. (We may compare the roughly contemporaneous reaction in this country against the systems of Bosanquet and Alexander, though the arguments were for the most part very different.) M. Bréhier, however, does not take this anti-systematic, pluralist tendency at its own valuation. French philosophy, he thinks, is in a phase that makes it comparable to medieval philosophy. It was characteristic of medieval philosophy that it comprised no individually constructed systems like those, for example, of Descartes, Leibniz, Hegel, and Schopenhauer, which have grown up and died away in Europe since the Renaissance. The main reason for this was that Christianity itself provided a common system which was never to be questioned, so that philosophers concerned themselves not with systems, for that would have led to heresy, but with particular problems. Part of M. Bréhier's parallel with modern times is that some Christians and all Marxists aim to produce the same condition."
10.1017/s0031819100034586,Philosophy In France,"A philosophical survey should, I take it, attempt to supply as much information as possible in a conveniently short space. When the space is as short as it must be here, the survey is in danger of turning into a catalogue. This danger can be avoided easily enough when one or two among the works under review stand far and obviously above the others in general interest and importance, for they may properly receive exclusive attention. But this is not the case, I think, as far as the works received from France and Belgium in the past year are concerned. The first need seems to be for a guide to enable some bearings to be found. Let it be added, with regret, that while it may be possible to mention some of the works that have not in fact been received by this journal, there is far from being any guarantee that there are no omissions of anyworth."
10.1017/s0031819100022828,Philosophy And Religion,"I. Since the beginnings of philosophy, in all cultures which have produced any, religion and philosophy have been closely tied up together, and have often been uneasy yoke-fellows, each at times feeling it a duty to combat the other. I think there are two main reasons for this, (a) All higher religions develop a theology, or systematic statement of doctrine; the philosopher tends to regard this as a spurious kind of philosophy or science that deliberately neglects inconvenient facts; while the theologian in his turn suspects the philosopher of ignoring important data which he ought to consider, viz.: the phenomena of concrete religion, (b) Akin to this is the tendency of both parties to use the word “God” in a different sense; Pascal’s objection that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is not the God of the philosophers is prima facie justified. Nevertheless both parties might have a claim to use the word."
10.1017/s0031819100046027,German Philosophy,"A New Philosophy of History for our age of transition from the Christian era to the period of world-unity, combined with a penetrating analysis of our present situation, is offered by Karl Jaspers'Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte(Artemis-Verlag, Fr. 14.80). Jaspers is, however, more post-Hegelian than post-Christian, and in fact anti-Hegelian, but pro-Christian. Rejecting Hegel's dictum that the appearance of Christ is the “axis of world history,” i.e. the aim of the preceding, and the origin of the subsequent, centuries, Jaspers tries to discover the realaxisof history empirically at about 500 b.c. Eager to find a common historical origin for East and West, he claims the time from 800 to 200 b.c. asaxis-time. He believes that in these centuries, man as we know him to-day, with his religion, art, philosophy, and science, emerged in China, India, Iran, Palestine, and Greece. He further believes that a newaxis-timeis approaching, and the analysis of the three tendencies leading to it, i.e. of socialism, world-unity, and faith, forms one of the most valuable parts of the book. Like Toynbee he believes that a return to a transformed Biblical faith is necessary, if the West is to be saved. Pessimistic about the immediate future, he is optimistic concerning the remote future. History, as the history of single nations, states, or civilizations, is at an end. World History is only just now beginning. This is a book of European importance. It formulates the crucial question, whether Europe has still the spiritual strength to avoid a relapse into its Asiatic background with its despotism, uniformity and loss of personal liberty. In Jaspers' development, it marks a transition from reflecting upon mere possibilities to a consideration of historical reality. His booklet,The Spiritual Situation of our Time(1931) concluded with a chapter on “What may become of Man,” but what really did happen to man in the meantime proved that reality is much richer in possibilities than the liveliest imagination could possibly foresee. Does he now actually reach reality, or rather a “possible” History, as the stage on which man reveals himself in all his potentialities, and which moves from one fictitiousaxis-timeto another equally fictitious? Jaspers'Einführung in die Philosophie(Artemis, Fr. 7.90), most enjoyable and a masterpiece of book-production, is the best introduction to his own philosophy. It emerges here as a possible form of philosophizing in an age of transition; original, sincere, cultivated and stimulating. His method is still the way of reflection, but this now includes meditation and self-examination. Jaspers rightly demands of-a philosopher (1) a thorough knowledge of one special science, (2) an equally penetrating knowledge of at least one great philosopher, and (3) sincerity in his daily conduct and acceptance of responsibility for whatever he is doing. Should he succeed in educating a generation of philosophers on these lines, that would indeed give new hope for the future of European philosophy. Jaspers' Inaugural Lecture,Philosophic und Wissen-schaft(Artemis, Fr. 1.30), discusses in a clear and competent manner this important problem and clearly exposes the confusion of some contemporary conceptions of science, e.g. in Marxism. His lecture,Unsere Zukunft und Goethe(Artemis, Fr. 3.–), rejects a Goethe cult, but stresses the new manner in which Goethe could be appreciated by the present generation. All in all, Jaspers represents the best in German tradition, and is now one of the leading European philosophers."
10.1017/s0031819100019215,Reflections On The Natural Philosophy Of Goethe,"Lichtenberg, the German philosopher and physicist, once remarked: “It is almost impossible to carry the torch of truth through a crowd without singeing someone's beard.” Goethe, coeval with Lichtenberg, possessed by the conviction that he too was the bearer of truth, recked not whose beard was singed. Between his scientific attitude and his philosophic insight, however, a contradiction was patent, as revealed in his maxim that truth is a torch and that it is only with blinking eyes that we try to get past it, whilst in actual terror of being burnt."
10.1017/s0031819100021720,Psychiatric Prolegomena: a Plea for the Help of Philosophy,"“It is almost impossible for a working neurologist to think clearly about the functions of the highest centres because the counters of thought, the words he must employ—are often of psychological origin and for the most part meaningless.”"
10.1017/s0031819100026784,Changing Methods in Philosophy,"Almost all the original philosophers, from Socrates to the verificationists of the present day, have tried to provide some universally applicable method of eliminating confusion and error from our discourse: this provision of a method of ‘correcting the understanding’ is at least one, and perhaps the principal, of the continuous threads which can be traced in Western philosophy. There was the Socratic method, which requires us to look for real definitions of our fundamental abstract terms: the Cartesian methods of rejecting as possible candidates for knowledge any propositions which do not consist of clear and distinct ideas: the Humean or Empiricist method of dismissing as nonsense any non-tautologous statement which cannot be justified as referring to the order of our sensations: Kant's transcendental method of critical philosophy, whichit would certainly be imprudent to characterize in a phrase, but which was equally intended to be a safe protection against empty metaphysics and meaningless questions: lastly, the verification principle, which provides a general method of determining which of our statements conform to some scientific standard of intelligibility, and which are to classed as tautologies or as playing with words. New movements in philosophy have in general been new methods of correcting the understanding, methods which are further generalized and applied in the interval before another great philosopher appears with another general method of showing that all previous metaphysics is nonsense."
10.1017/s0031819100007762,The Human Person in Contemporary Philosophy,"I. In the early part of the sixth century a.d. Boethius defined the person as “an individual substance of rational nature” (rationalis naturae individua substantia). This definition, which became classical and was adopted by, for example, St. Thomas Aquinas, obviously implies that every human being is a person, since every human being is (to employ the philosophical terms of Boethius) an individual substance of rational nature. If one cannot be more or less of a human being, so far as “substance” is concerned, one cannot be more or less of a person. One may act as a human person ought not to act or in a way unbefitting a human person; one may even lose the normal use of one's reason; but one does not in this way become depersonalized, in the sense of ceasing to be a person. According to St. Thomas, a disembodied soul is not, strictly speaking, a person, since a disembodied soul is no longer a complete human substance; but every complete human substance is always and necessarily a person."
10.1017/s0031819100006902,Philosophy and Psychiatry,"I Am grateful for the honour of being invited to give the second Manson Lecture. Dr. Manson believed that the study of sick people leads into the widest fields of thought, but that increasing specialization within medicine diverts the doctor from seeing man and his nature whole: the chief question seems to be (he wrote in 1930), “whether medicine is in the bondship of practice, whether it is a skilled art, or whether it can emerge to give its own contribution to abstract thought and philosophy.” Indeed, pleading with doctors to join this Institute of Philosophy, he declared that medicine should be the most philosophic of the professions. In this he was reviving an ancient claim: the arguments for it have lately been restated with much Aristotelian piety by Scott Buchanan. Now here I find myself in a difficulty at the outset: I am to speak of the relationship between philosophy and medicine, at a lecture founded by a passionate believer in their conjunction, yet I am engaged in a particular branch of medicine which was for longer than any other preoccupied with philosophy and dependent on it, but had so little profit from its fidelity that it reckons progress from the time when it struggled away from this allegiance. Psychiatry has not been able to refrain since then from many a backward glance at the older philosophy she once swore by, and she has been much influenced by the philosophies of later times: she has—doubtless in punishment for her defection—become entangled now and then in bad, unrecognized philosophy of her own making. She has, at all events, never achieved more than a temporary indifference to philosophic thought."
10.1017/s0031819100006914,Intuition in Christian Philosophy,"The object of this paper is to examine the concept of intuition and to determine what part, if any, it should play in Christian philosophy. It is a complex inquiry, and I shall have to save space by a certain economy of purely historical detail, and also, if you will allow me, by by-passing the vexed question of Revelation and Natural Theology. It seems to me that whatever the issue of this debate may prove to be, it will not prevent philosophers from plying their trade; and whether they, or some of them, are to be dignified with the title of Natural Theologians is a problem they can leave to others. The only remaining question is, whether it is lawful for a Christian minister to engage in philosophy. As philosophy is not an openly scandalous pursuit, and there is no canon against it, I take the answer to be “Yes.” I would have you regard this paper as an essay in philosophy and allow me to investigate certain aspects of human knowledge, and the light they throw on man's knowledge of God, without presupposing a self-revelation of God to man. Without presupposing, but also without excluding it; revelation cannot be a primary datum for the philosopher, but it may well turn out to be his only ultimately satisfactory conclusion.Adopting this standpoint, we shall inevitably be traversing that current of thought which reached England about fifty years ago and which, with its eddies and counter-currents, is still a moving force: I mean the insistence on religious experience, and more particularly the analysis of religious experience by the methods of psychology. In practice this method tended to concentrate on the experiences of the individual, and to disregard the far richer store of experience which lay crystallized in historic documents and liturgies—except in so far as these acted as a stimulus to individual piety."
10.1017/s0031819100005507,The Philosophy of Berdyaeff,"The late Archbishop Temple regarded Berdyaeff as one of the most important writers of the present time, and several good judges have said the same. He is a lonely, original, combative thinker,nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri, whose philosophy is based solely on his own spiritual experience. Contradictions and ambiguities may certainly be found in his writings, but the same may be said of every philosopher who recognizes what Heraclitus calls the fathomless depths of human personality, the clash of Yes and No in which Boehme says that all things consist. For himomnia exeunt in mysterium. He does not attempt an ambitious and coherent system, or disguise his transient obligations to the various currents of thought which he has followed and in part rejected. As he says himself, “the contradictions which may be found in my thought are expressions of spiritual conflict, of contradictions which lie at the very heart of existence itself.”"
10.1017/s0031819100025353,R. G. Collingwood's Philosophy of History,"Philosophy of history is not a subject which has hitherto attracted much attention in this country. Preoccupation with the methods and achievements of the natural sciences, and distaste for the sort of rationale of history as a whole which Hegel and others offered under the title in the early nineteenth century, have served to make most British philosophers accord its problems only the most casual recognition. It is therefore all the more interesting to find an English writer of unusual powers both of argument and expression, who was himself an historian of distinction in his special field, devoting a large part of his philosophical thinking to the problems of historical knowledge and their wider implications. Unfortunately, R. G. Collingwood was not able to begin the major work on philosophy of history, to writing which, as we are told in the introduction to the present book, he had looked forward for twenty-five years, until his powers were seriously affected by bad health, and he did not live to complete it. But though the full results of his thinking on the subject are lost, we are now able, thanks to the skilful work of his friend Professor T. M. Knox, to study what is in effect an extensive interim report on it. Professor Knox has producedThe Idea of Historylargely on the basis of lectures which Collingwood prepared in 1936, supplemented by two essays already published which date from the same period and a certain amount of material from the unfinishedPrinciples of Historywritten in 1939."
10.1017/s0031819100025365,Philosophy in France,"The last survey of philosophy in France to appear in this journal was published in July 1939. Although the circumstances of the war do not seem to have prevented the publication of philosophical books in France to the extent that they have done so in this country, they have pretty effectively limited their transmission across the Channel until the last year or two. In consequence it is by no means easy to re-establish continuity between the publications of the pre-war period and the rather random trickle of new books now being received by the editor ofPhilosophy. Some useful information on the intervening period is contained in an article by Professor Lalande in thePhilosophical Reviewfor January 1946 (Vol. LV, No. 1). Readers of this article or of the files of theRevue Philosophiquewill find that in 1940 occurred the deaths of Abel Rey, known for his work on science in the ancient world, and of the philosopher and sociologist Célestin Bougié. In 1941 Bergson died. 1944 saw the death of Léon Brunschvicg, whoseDescartes et Pascal lecteurs de Montaigneappeared that same year. Jean Cavaillfès, a logician known for his works published in 1938 on the axiomatic method and the theory of groups, was shot by the Germans for his part in the resistance movement. Maurice Halbwachs, for many years associated with theAnnée Sociologiquedied in Buchenwald in 1945. As for books that appeared during the war, I have not seen Professor Le Senne'sTraité de Morale Générale, which appeared in 1942."
10.1017/s0031819100005696,Philosophy and Mathematics,"This essay is an attempt to take stock of what has been done by those who have worked on the foundations of mathematics and to suggest, very inadequately in so short a space, what may be a satisfactory approach to this subject for one who is not an expert in it. The subject is one that neither mathematicians nor philosophers can any longer afford to ignore, but in the technicalities of which they may not be very interested."
10.1017/s0031819100006537,Nature's Education of Man Some Remarks on the Philosophy of Wordsworth,"The essence of Wordsworth's creed appears, at first glance, to be simple and unambiguous: if we train the eye and ear to become receptive to the influence of natural objects, we come in time to receive “authentic tidings of invisible things,” intuitive knowledge of a Spirit which informs both Nature and the mind of man. This Spirit is a source of spiritual power; communion with it brings serenity and joy. But for all the apparent simplicity of this creed, we are soon forced to ask difficult questions about it. For example, how, precisely, are we to conceive of this universal Spirit? It is “a motion and a spirit” which informs all things; but what else is it? If it can elevate the thoughts of man, is it itself possessed of moral attributes? Is it, for instance, a Spirit of Love? In order to understand more precisely how Wordsworth believed the Spirit, particularly as it manifested itself in the works of Nature, could influence and shape the mind of man, it will be necessary to turn chiefly toThe Preludeand, by reference to it, to endeavour to answer the following questions:(1) What, besides motion and infinitude, did Wordsworth consider the properties of the Universal Spirit to be?(2) How did he believe man acquires knowledge of it? And(3) In what precise sense did he maintain that Nature can educate man morally?All quotations fromThe Prelude, unless otherwise stated, will be drawn from the 1805–6 version of the poem."
10.1017/s0031819100006124,Whitehead's Philosophy: The World as Process,"This paper will endeavour to present an outline of the Organic Philosophy associated with the name of Whitehead. Whitehead resembles Spinoza and Leibniz in that he is a philosopher who has tried to construct a world-outlook that will do justice to science and to the other aspects of life and knowledge. Moreover, just as in his day Leibniz was an eminent mathematician and scientist, so Whitehead in our day enjoys the same distinction. But Whitehead's philosophy differs both from that of Spinoza and from that of Leibniz. Spinoza based his philosophy upon the monistic substance, of which the actual events in the world are the inferior modes. Whitehead bases his philosophy upon the actual events themselves and derives the solidarity of the world as a whole from their mutual interplay. Thus the organic philosophy is pluralistic in contrast with Spinoza's monism. In comparing Whitehead's philosophy with that of Leibniz, we find that they agree in both being pluralistic, but they differ in the emphasis placed upon the notion of mentality. Leibniz's monads are best conceived as generalizations of the notion of mentality, and the conception of physical bodies only enters into his philosophy subordinately and derivatively. Whitehead, however, in his philosophy of organism endeavours to hold the balance between the physical and mental more evenly, and thus does justice to both aspects of reality."
10.1017/s0031819100023317,Is Philosophy Possible? A Study of Logical Positivism,"The present situation in philosophy is paradoxical. On the one hand, thinking men and women all over the world are exclaiming that, while science has made sufficient advance to satisfy all our material needs, what we most need, and must find if we are not to suffer shipwreck, is a new sense of values, a new religious awakening and a new orientation towards life, in short a new philosophy. On the other hand, many professional philosophers are coming to hold the view that philosophy has had its day, or rather that it never in any proper sense had its day, because it is not a rational enterprise but a mistake, an illusion, a farrago of nonsense, “a muddle arising out of the complexities of language.” A new inquiry which goes by the name of Analysis and resembles logic more closely than any other existing discipline is at once to give the quietus to philosophy and to reign in its stead. The modern philosopher cries, with Faustus, “Sweet Analytickes! 'tis thou hast ravished me.” I will not prejudice your minds at the outset by recalling where the study of analysis led the Doctor of Wurtemburg.Those who are thus forthrightly sceptical about philosophy and group themselves under the aegis of analysis are themselves divided into a number of sects. One and all, however, are relentless in exposing the weaknesses of philosophy, zealous in proselytizing and deadly in expounding their new technique which combines scholastic subtlety with modern scientific realism. They represent in fact a modern scholasticism loosely grouped round the dogma: “We pursue logical analysis, but not philosophy,” though, by a curious paradox which demands scrutiny, some of them say: “Philosophyisanalysis.”"
10.1017/s0031819100023329,Language and Philosophy Some Suggestions for an Empirical Approach,"Preoccupation withlanguageis a notable feature of modern philosophy. Indeed, it is not too much to say that the influence of language on thought, and particularly its influence on philosophical thought, is a leading topic of philosophical discussion in this century. Every philosopher of any note, no matter what his general interests may be, has found it necessary to define his attitude to this problem. The attitude usually adopted consists of an admission that language does have a great influence on thought, and on philosophical thought in particular. More accurately, it is claimed that the structure and grammatical categories, and perhaps the vocabulary, natural to a particular language,determinethe lines of thought and speculation open to any thinker who uses that language (Note 1).This determination is unimportant in many cases, because the results of our thinking are usually subject to check by appeal to empirical facts. In philosophical thinking, however, no such check is available by the very nature of the case. Accordingly, we cannot tell if the difficulty or apparent insolubility of a philosophical problem is due to the problem itself, or simply due to inadequacies in our language. In a different language, so it is suggested, the problem which is difficult for us might very easily be solved. Indeed, there might not then be any such problem, or its solution might be self-evident in this other language. This is the moderate attitude to the language difficulty in philosophy, and it is fair to say that it is almost universally adopted at the present day. In some circles it has acquired the prestige of an indisputable dogma."
10.1017/s0031819100023330,The Perennial Philosophy,"The phrasephilosophia perennisis said to have been first used by Leibniz. It has been adopted and freely employed by the Catholic Neo-Thomists, for whom it means a development of the Aristotelianism, modified by strong Neoplatonic elements, which Arabian scholars transmitted to the first Renaissance in the West. It claims also to be a return to the early Christian philosophy of religion, a fusion of Hellenistic and Jewish thought, the latter itself a syncretistic religion with many Persian and other borrowings. The controversy, directed against various modern philosophies, has been conducted with great ability by such writers as Gilson, Maritain, Sheen, Watkin, Dawson and D'Arcy, whose books would perhaps have received more attention from independent thinkers, but for the suspicion which surrounds apparent attempts to revive the methods and inhibitions of the medieval schoolmen.There has been a parallel movement in the Orthodox Eastern Church, represented in Russian by Frank, Bardyaeff, Solovioff and Lossky. These writers are more Platonic and more fearlessly mystical than the Thomists. Origen in the East has more weight than Augustine."
10.1017/s0031819100023342,Philosophy in Italy,"After an interruption of seven years I take up once again my surveys of Italian philosophy. Many things have happened in the interval, but it is perhaps too soon for them to be susceptible of calm philosophical reflection. The problems that most interest the cultured public to-day are those of existentialism, of historicism and its limits, of German romanticism, and, more generally, of Germanic culture in relation to new spiritual orientations. The interest in existentialism is due, at least in part, to the fact that it is the philosophy in fashion. But there is in it nevertheless a depth of seriousness that is not overlooked. The tragedies of recent years have placed in the foreground the problems of immediate existence, of human personality and its place in the world, which the preceding idealistic philosophy had too easily absorbed in an impersonal and trans-subjective view of the spirit and its universal values. And, as has often happened in the course of history, there has resulted a reaction of individuality, in its most irrational and vital expressions, against the pretensions of reason to dominate it from above, and imprison it in the net of its concepts.But if, in this regard, existentialism represents a just demand, which can exercise a beneficial influence on philosophical thought, yet to many its claim to represent a new era in philosophy seems excessive. Its value is only that of an episode. Hence some interpreters of contemporary thought have been drawn to limit the importance of the new movement."
10.1017/s0031819100005143,The Epistemological Foundations of Natural Philosophy,"The history of Natural Philosophy is dominated by a paradox; broadly speaking, a vast increase in its range of application to the external world has been accompanied by a sweeping simplification in its basic assumptions. From the standpoint of Empiricism this dual development appears utterly mysterious. On the other hand, Rationalism, which seeks to demonstrate the metaphysical necessity of natural law, and hence might throw light on this development, has been generally discredited, particularly by men of science. It is not surprising, therefore, that philosophical discussion of scientific method has become a Babel of confusing tongues."
10.1017/s0031819100005179,Whitehead's Philosophy: The Higher Phases of Experience,"In my last article I described fully the important type of entity in Whitehead's philosophy called “propositions,” and explained the part they played in conscious experience. We learnt that “consciousness” was a certain kind of emergent quality associated with the late phase of concrescence of some high-grade actual entities. It was pointed out that whenever consciousness was present in experience, this proved to be the subjective form of an integral synthetic feeling composed of (1) a physical feeling and (2) a pro-positional feeling. This integral feeling was said to be a feeling of contrast between “actuality” and “ideality,” between a fact and a possibility. That is to say consciousness is the subjective form of the feeling of a contrast between what actualityis, andmight not be, or what actualityis not, and yetmight be. We can now proceed to deal with a number of higher phases of experience such as “belief,” “conscious perception,” “judgment,” together with experiences termed by Whitehead “physical purposes.”"
10.1017/s0031819100004605,The Relations between Science and Philosophy,"This paper has been written in the light of recent discussions on the relevance of the New Physics to Philosophy, and with particular reference to a symposium held at the Royal Institution on May 19, 1943. It seemed to me that, at the symposium, there was some misunderstanding both on the part of the scientists and on the part of the philosophers, mainly due to the fact that neither quite realized what the opposite side considered to be the function of science and philosophy. One of the few things that emerged clearly was that the scientists thought the new physics (by which was meant the developments in physics associated with the names Einstein, Planck, Rutherford, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Dirac) had very definite relevance for philosophy, while the philosophers thought that it had no relevance at all. It would seem that such disagreement could be due only to disagreement about what the new physics attempts to do, or to disagreement about what philosophy attempts to do. I shall consider each of these in turn."

This morning he observed the fresh green of the spring grass, and at the same time heard from an adjacent hawthorn bush the cheerful song of the thrush. As he proceeded, the scent of burning brushwood in a clearing near by was smelt. He picked up a stick lying on the grass and used it as a staff. Within a few minutes he had enjoyed sense experience through eyes, ears, nose and hands. In the autumn he hopes to gather from the bushes a handful of blackberries, as he has done in many previous years, and enjoy their luscious taste."
10.1017/s0031819100004964,Whitehead's Philosophy: Propositions and Consciousness,"In earlier articles I explained the fundamental entities in the Organic Philosophy, namely: actual entities or actual occasions, and eternal objects. But there is also a third type of entity called “propositions,” very important for the introduction of novelty into our world, and indispensable for “consciousness” and the higher phases of experience. Before discussing Consciousness and these higher phases, it is necessary, therefore, to give an account of propositions."

Almost all things which once seemed sacred and immutable have now become unsettled—truth and humanity, justice and reason. An apprehension of impending doom, of the break up of a great civilization, has become general."
10.1017/s0031819100036172,Hegel's Dialectic in Historical Philosophy,"Conflicting Systems in the History of Philosophy.Hegel's logic consists, as is well known, in a chain of categories, connected by a relation of dialectic, which proceeded from the featureless Being, Nothing, and Becoming through more important ones such as Substance, Cause, and Reciprocity to the highest category of all, the Absolute Idea. Now Hegel also pointed to an interesting correlation between the categories of his logic and the dominant concepts of those philosophies that preceded his own: that is to say, thelogicalorder of categories given by him corresponded to thetemporalorder of the history of philosophy. Such connexion was not, however, to be regarded as an accident but as a necessary truth: for the Absolute manifested itself temporally in the form of the history of philosophy. Seeing that this contention probably contains some psychological truth and is probably assumed in Marxian interpretations of Hegel, it may be of some interest to see how far it can be substantiated."
10.1017/s0031819100002540,Kierkegaard and the “Existential” Philosophy,"It is a wise child who knows his own father; and the climate of thought of a generation may be subtly changed without conscious recognition of the formative minds which have been, if not the parents, at least the godparents of that change. That is to say, they have sponsored the baptism of ideas which would only be safe so long as they renounced the world, the flesh, and the devil; but, as is so often the case, when the offspring grow up they form a pact with those very powers. To make Søren Kierkegaard spiritually responsible for the present war would have as little, and perhaps as much, truth in it as the facile explanations which made Hegel responsible for the last one. But it is part of the demonism of policies of power and ambition to be able to pervert to their own ends religious ideas which in their intention are a protest against those very ambitions; and, by so doing, to win a response from people who, in a dim, unconscious way, are feeling after the ideas themselves, but have neither the powers of self-criticism nor of radical thinking to resist travesties of them which appear to justify their own self-assertion. When Hitler informed Sir Nevile Henderson that he was a man of “ad infinitumdecisions” we may question the extent of his knowledge either of the Latin language or of the existential philosophy; but the phrase awakes an echo of the religious philosophy of circles far removed from National-Socialism. Both Nazi apologists and their Confessional or independent opponents are consciously or unconsciously moved by a way of thinking which puts thedecisionof the individual, made in the concrete moment, above any objective or universal norm of ethics or of reason by which it can be either justified or criticized."
10.1017/s0031819100002564,Whitehead'S Philosophy: Actual Entities,"I have tried to expound Whitehead's doctrine of Creativity and of actual entities. Nothing remains but to give a brief summary of what has been said in the foregoing notes.Creativity is the ultimate activity and principle of novelty in the Universe.The world is said to consist of “actual entities,” not substances. An actual entity is also called an “actual occasion.” It is essentially a genetic process, having two sides, (I) the process of “becoming,” and (2) the outcome of the process named the “satisfaction.” The satisfaction is the fully determined achievement abstracted from the process. On attaining satisfaction the actual entity viewed as a self-creating subject loses its “final” causation, and as asubjectperishes, but the “satisfaction” remains as a potential constituent for the emergence of a new actual entity. This is its “efficient” causation. The potentiality of the satisfaction for a new creation is called its “objective immortality”: in this capacity it functions as an “object” for the self-creation of another actual entity."
10.1017/s0031819100001911,The Methods and Problems of Philosophy,"Philosophy is commonly referred to as a “spirit” of inquiry, a general attitude toward things, rather than a body of conclusions; but as every spirit in this world musthavea body, so philosophy must have amethod. The expression, “philosophical method,” is used with somewhat varying meanings, but it is the question of how philosophical conclusions are attained that we have in mind in the present article."
10.1017/s0031819100027352,Gestalt Psychology and Ethical Philosophy,"The object of the present article is to indicate where and how Gestalt psychology bears on the problems of the ethical philosopher. Unlike the other “schools” of psychology (Behaviourism, Freudianism, and Purposivism), Gestaltism has no obvious bearing on these problems; and yet, if we accept its fundamental tenet, it appears to carry important implications for ethical philosophy. This tenet concerns the primacy of totalities or wholes. I will begin with it, and then proceed to consider certain further principles of Gestalt which are of interest to the moralist."

In this family are included, along with philosophy itself, two extremely important human interests, science and religion, all of which have a common concern in the fundamental problems of human experience, and attempt in various ways to satisfy man's need of adjusting himself to the universe which lies about him. Of these three related interests, Religion may be thought of as one of the parents of"

What does it mean to say that the cosmos is one, that a thing is one, that an organism is one, that a nation is one, that mind and body are one, that knower and known are one? Exactly what is it that is denoted when unity is postulated of anything? And when two or more entities are conceived as subsisting in unity, exactly what is the relation between that unity on the one hand, and its correlative duality or plurality on the other?"

In France, Bastide, Murisier, Récéjac, Boutroux, Delacroix, Janet, Poulain, Bremond, Bergson, Bréhier. In America, besides William James, Starbuck, Leuba, Coe, Hocking, Rufus Jones, P. E.

10.1017/s0031819100014236,Philosophy in Italy,"BenedettoCroce'sbook on history1is the ideal continuation of his earlier book published over a score of years ago on “La Teoria e Storia della storiografia” forming the final part of the “Filosofia dello spirito.” During this long period Croce has had the opportunity to enrich and extend his historiographical experiences with a series of volumes, of which those on the History of Naples, the History of Italy, and the History of Europe in the Nineteenth Century are the most important and have had the widest repercussions. In all this range of experience his fundamental theses on the character and value of history have not been substantially altered. They have actually developed in breadth and depth, so that in the present volume we find them with their characteristic lineaments, old and new together, rendered fuller and more vivid by the rich lymph of the concrete problems of historical life by which they are nourished. In the meantime a series of violent and tumultuous changes, provoking vehement opposing mental reactions, has brought into discussion grave doubts, raised on certain points which first appeared firmly established in the historical view of the world. The antithesis has moved Croce to reaffirm his thought with renewed polemic ardour, thereby throwing it into stronger relief, and giving it a greater sense of reality."
10.1017/s0031819100011372,Philosophy as Action,"In studying the problems of philosophy, it is commonly considered an advantage to approach them through the history of philosophy, But to be compelled to spread one's sails, and take one's solitary course, “as if no Plato or Kant had ever existed,” has perhaps its advantages too."
10.1017/s0031819100014467,Economics and Philosophy,"Ina recent article inPhilosophy(April, 1936) Professor Knox makes a plea for a philosophic treatment of economic activity by way of contrast to either the specialized study of economic history or of economic science. The conclusion which was reached was embodied in the statement that “the historical and scientific methods of the study of economic activity leave incompletely satisfied the curiosity ofstudents, and reach results which need special interpretation before they can be useful to politicians, let alone tobusiness men”(p. 159). Each of these methods is said to involve unreal abstractions which detract from the usefulness of the study. A philosophic"
10.1017/s0031819100014492,Philosophy in Germany,"Oneof the fundamental differences between English and German civilisation which leads to different philosophical problems is their attitude to the reality of history. The English “live” history as if it were nature. They found at least by the thirteenth century their own form of life, of government, constitution, and state, which have lasted ever since through all changes so that a rich system of traditions has developed. Germany did not find a lasting unity as early as that, but, being divided into many autonomous parts, religions, and tribes, it did not reach a strong social or moral tradition. Consequently the “rise of the historical consciousness“ and even the wish to awaken the nation as a whole to it is in Germany an intellectual product. But what has been a disadvantage in the sphere of politics has been an advantage to science and philosophy. The German even believes it to be one of their chief contributions to the History of Thought that they have developed a scientific history and all the sciences which analyse its field, and above that the “Historism,“ a historicalWeltanschauungor the task of interpreting the whole world from the point of view of history."

But if I were to introduce myself as a professor of philosophy, I suspect that many of them would vaguely associate my subject with theosophy, or palmistry, or occultism. Very few would have any notion of what philosophy really is. Even in a university, even among the learned themselves, it would be true to say, I think, that"

Are you an Idealist or a Realist, a Platonist or a Hobbist, a Monist or a Pluralist?”"
10.1017/s0031819100012171,Philosophy in Germany,"Thepurpose ofWissenschaft und Weltanschaunng,1by Aloys Wenzl, is to provide a rational explanation of the world which shall give us greater insight into its nature than either common sense or the natural sciences can give us. Philosophy, Professor Wenzl says in his introduction, springs from the desire for aweltanschaunng, for insight into the significance of life. But it also springs from a desire forrational explanation, and aims at objective validity. It proposes to give a truer, more complete, and more intelligible account of reality than appearances provide. This idea of a more intelligible explanation underlies the whole of Professor Wenzl's book. We want more than knowledge of empirical facts, we want knowledge of reasons (verstehen aus dem Grund), or, as he often puts it, insight (einsichtig verstehen). We want to see that though things seem to be contingent, they are really necessary."

Firstly, he was an “empiricist”; secondly, he occupied an inconsistent intermediate position on the road to Berkeley and Hume; thirdly, he was pre-eminently the philosopher of common sense; fourthly, he committed the epistemological error of teaching that our only objects of knowledge were ideas in our mind which copied reality. All these dicta contain an important element of truth, but are misleading by reason of the excessive emphasis which has been placed upon them."

If I were dealing with the philosophy of religion, I should, of course, have much to say on the place of myth in theology; and what I have to say may have some bearing on this subject; but I am not dealing with particular dogmas of Christianity or of any other religion. My thesis is that when the mind communes with the world of values its natural and inevitable language is the language of poetry, symbol, and myth. And, further, that philosophy has to deal with a number of irreducible surds which cannot be rationalized. They must be accepted as given material for reason to work upon. For example, we do not know why there is a world; we cannot unify the world of what we call facts and the world of values; there are antinomies in space and time which do not seem to disappear when we put a hyphen between them. Our reason–some would say reason itself— has reached its limits. We are driven to mythologize, confessing that we have left the realm of scientific fact. We give rein to the imagination, not exactly claiming with Wordsworth that it is reason in her most exalted mood, but hoping that the creative imagination may reveal to us some of the real meaning of questions which we cannot answer."

10.1017/s0031819100030266,Philosophy in Italy,"Platonic studies continue to be cultivated, even in Italy, with undiminished fervour. And in Italy, as in England and Germany, interpretation tends to pass from one extreme to the opposite. At one time the chief concern of the exponents of Plato was to reconstruct his ”system“; and since his thought did not easily lend itself to unification, every effort was made to force it within the limits of a preconceived scheme. The present tendency, however, is to start from the opposite standpoint–that there is no philosophy of Plato, only a variable philosophical activity which is, as it were, consumed in each dialogue in turn, to be rekindled inexplicably in the next. Hence the work of interpretation reduces itself to a summary of the contents of various writings, arranged as far as possible in chronological order, and each examined independently as a complete and self-sufficing entity. The systematic interpreters used to make all the dialogues burn with a single flame, for which is now substituted a series ofignes fatuiin which the connection is lost, or only visible at intervals."

In a learned introduction there are prefixed to the edition three indexes, of the codices, editions, and works of Ficino, and with each work is given a concise account of its origin, purpose, and fortune in the world.

10.1017/s0031819100010160,The International Congress on Philosophy,"Its broad, winding river, crossed by a multitude of bridges; its surrounding hills, amongst which stands conspicuous the long line of the Hradcine, topped by a continuous stretch of stately buildings with the cathedral of St. Vitus towering above them; the wide expanse of its numerous streets, over which rise the spires of many churches, ancient towers, and the lofty walls of numerous municipal and university buildings; the long history to which its architecture bears everywhere striking witness and of which its inhabitants are justly proud, rendered the city of Prague a no less fitting background for the eighth philosophical Congress than that which Oxford provided four years ago for the seventh. Nor was the hospitality which Czechoslovakia offered to its members a whit less cordial or less generous than that of England. The delegates who gathered together from all parts of Europe, from America, China, and from Japan, were welcomed both by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Beneš by the Minister of Public Instruction, Dr. Krčmář, by the Mayor of Prague; and, were it not for his unfortunate illness, would have been received by the President of the Republic himself. The Společenský club was placed at their disposal. They were entertained at the Foreign Office to tea, and at the palace of the President to supper by his daughter, Dr. Alice Masaryk. Their railway fares and even their tram fares were considerably reduced. On Thursday they were conveyed by motor-cars to Konopišté, a beautiful castle, soaring above pine forests and overlooking an extensive lake, formerly the residence of the Archduke Franz-Ferdinand, now taken over by the State, but maintained exactly as it was when the unfortunate heir of the Emperor Franz-Joseph was living there. The arrangements for the Congress were excellent, thanks to its President, Dr. Rádl, and to an extremely efficient organizing committee which placed itself unreservedly and unremittingly at the disposal of the 350 active and 150 associated members who attended the various meetings."
10.1017/s0031819100035300,Philosophy in Italy,"Of late yeaxs Benedetto Croce's interpretation of the philosophy of G. B. Vico has been exposed to continual criticism from Catholic writers anxious to claim for themselves the figure of the great eighteenth-century thinker, wrested from them by Croce for inclusion in a setting of secular and immanentistic philosophy. The Catholic polemic was founded partly on a false supposition: it derived from the idea that Croce meant to deny entirely Vico's Catholicism. Instead, Croce made a distinction between Vico the man and Vico the philosopher. While he recognized that the man cherished Catholic sentiments and beliefs, he denied that the philosopher could reenter the circle of dogmatic and confessional philosophy. To confirm the accuracy of his interpretation, Croce has now republished an interesting monograph by an eighteenth-century Catholic writer, a little later than Vico, G. F. Finetti,1 who subjects the doctrine of Vico to a lively criticism. The motive of this exhumation is plain: “The protest of eighteenth-century Catholic criticism against the doctrines of Vico, or rather, against the doctrines of an author well known to be a blameless observant throughout his life, is of considerable importance because it is the first real acknowledgment of the revolutionary spirit, the anti-Catholic and generally anti-religious spirit, which informed his doctrines.”"
10.1017/s003181910001024x,Philosophy in Germany,"In his introduction to the logic of morals Karl Menger (Vienna) maintains that only two kinds of ethical inquiry are fruitful—the psychology or biology of morals and the logic of morals. The first of these is an empirical science which discovers what value judgments have actually been made and correlates them with various other factors. In this way it provides material for the logic of morals, which neither discovers empirical facts nor analyses them, but simply points out logical relations. In this book Menger discusses the nature of ethical judgments and carries out some investigations of the logical type."

Professor Whitehead, Sir Arthur Eddington, and Sir James Jeans have given to the world brilliant accounts of the present position of physics in relation to mathematics and philosophy. What I have to say bears to their writings, the humble relation of an example to a piece of book-work, or of an application of a theorem to the theorem itself."
10.1017/s0031819100030618,Philosophy in France,"No trait is more characteristic of contemporary philosophy in France than its continued fecundation by the physical and biological sciences. The divorce between philosophy and science that existed in the first half of last century is now regarded, by almost common consent, as an error of the great pre-war Unenlightenment. Theménageisrémonté; thevieilles traditionsof Descartes and Pascal live again, though very transfigured. How long the alliance may endure, how and how much it may benefit both parties, it would be idle to prophesy. But it is significant that Boutroux and Bergson were compelled to devote much energy to acquiring a scientific competence, the one in mechanics, the other in biology. It is still more significant that a number of professional scientists (such as Milhaud, Duhem, Hannequin, Paul Tannery, Poincare, and Meyerson) should, with the passing of years, have contributed less to their sciences and increasingly to philosophy. This mutual invasion of territories has, indeed, become so considerable and enduring that philosophy in France is at present, for good or ill, almost wholly ‘philosophy of the sciences.’ It is now within this ‘internationalized’ neutral zone that the distinction between the epistemological and the ontological has to be drawn. Thus, Meyerson fairly represents the former emphasis, Bergson and Le Roy the latter. And if it is rare for one man to hold successively a chair in mathematics and a chair in philosophy, like Milhaud and Whitehead, rarer still is it for one man to hold both concurrently. But M. Edouard Le Roy has for many years lectured on mathematics and mechanics at the Faculte des Sciences in Paris; he has extended and modified Bergsonism from Bergson's former chair at the College de France."
10.1017/s003181910003062x,Philosophy in Germany,"In theCritique of So-called Practical KnowledgeAlf Ross wishes to show that ethical judgments are nonsensical. He begins by asserting that when people speak about practical knowledge they mean knowledge which contains an unconditional command to the will, and this, he points out, involves a confusion between knowledge and volition. Thus, since all ethical theories are forms of practical knowledge, they are doomed to failure. All ethical theories can be classified into two types: they all belong to the ethics of value or the ethics of duty. These differ very radically, since the one takes value and the other duty as its fundamental concept; but they are inadequate for the same reasons. Both value and duty are self-contradictory concepts, and both awareness of value and awareness of duty are quite different from what ethical theories suppose."

Philosophical publications during the last year include Lenin’sPhilosophical Note-books; Dialectical Materialism and the Theory of Balance, by Selektor;Marx’s Philosophical Development, by Lipendin;A Course of Dialectical Materialism, by Markuse;Dialectical Materialism and Social Democracy, by Rudash;The Idealistic Dialectic of Hegel and the Materialist Dialectic of Marx, by L. Axelrod. On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of Marx’s death the Communist Academy Institute of Philosophy has published aSymposiumcontaining papers on materialistic dialectics, on the relation of Marxism-Leninism to culture and natural science, and discussion of those papers. A number of small textbooks on dialectical materialism, orDiamatas it is called for short, are issued for university schools not only in Russian but also in some of the languages spoken in the Soviet Union."
10.1017/s0031819100010214,An Approach to Philosophy,"The first important question which confronts the teacher of an introductory course in philosophy is likely to be the question as to how he may bestapproachthe subject of what philosophy is, how to approach it in such a way as to pique the curiosity and excite the interest of the student from the beginning. After considering this question many times, it has recently occurred to the present writer that it might be helpful to make this approach by way of a parable, an allegorical account of what seem to be the three basic human desires—the desire to live, the desire to enjoy life, and the desire to understand life. He accordingly offers this suggestion for whatever it may be worth, and presents the following little tale as at least one possible working-out of that suggestion."
10.1017/s0031819100016806,Philosophy in France,"It is precision, M. Bergson suggests in his last book,1that has most been lacking in philosophy. Imprecision declares itself in two respects: philosophical systems of the past apply indifferently to many imaginary worlds, and so allows this actual world to slip through their meshes; and they ignore the sense or direction evinced in the order and process of this actual world. Such systems “do not fit the reality in which we live, but are too large for it. Any of them would apply equally well to a world in which plants, animals, and men did not exist, or one in which men went without food and drink and did not sleep or dream or rave, to a world in which men were born decrepit and suckled in old age … Such systems of conceptions are so abstract, consequently so vast, that they can be made to hold everything possible alongside the real”. That we should interpret them always with an eye on this actual world and so regard them as being literal transcriptions of the actual is a witness to the practical bias of our thinking and a quite arbitrary reading of them. Contrasted with these highly abstract systems, M. Bergson claims that his own explanation “adheres to its object” and leaves no gap in which an alternative one could find foothold."
10.1017/s0031819100010238,Philosophy in France,"To the bulk of the British reading public ‘contemporary French philosophy’ would seem to be interchangeable with ‘the works of M. Bergson.’ And it can scarcely be otherwise when, as an erudite correspondent ofLe Tempsrelates, Paris now prints in a week one million books—as many as were printed annually in the reign of the Roi Soleil. For the proportion of these devoted to philosophy is not small. One voracious reader and professor of philosophy in Switzerland, Monsieur J.Benrubi, has withstood for thirty years the annual avalanche of philosophical books, read steadily on, abstracted and collated his gleanings. In him we have a most competent guide. Familiar with every rivulet and path, and with the historic formation of the country, he now reveals to us the whole panorama. His encyclopaedic enterprise,1treating some hundred and sixty authors, is neither a chronicle nor a classification, except in a secondary way. It aims principally at tracing cross-currents in recent philosophies so as to discover their internal connexions, and thence in what direction present French thought is heading. M. Benrubi's scrupulousness in seeing nobody is left out tends perhapsto overcrowding, and his emphasis on that which coheres may somewhat overshadow that which divides. And it may be inevitable, too, with a field of figures so vast, that the accounts of some should be insufficiently detailed. But the total effect is substantial, and his volumes are invaluable to whomever would appreciate whence and whither French thought is proceeding. There are three threads to guide us through the labyrinth. The distinct though still interacting tendencies are described as ‘empirical and scientific positivism,’ ‘epistemological and critical idealism,’ and ‘metaphysical and spiritual positivism.’ Each rests on certain characteristics manifested with varying explicitness in the thought of its many representatives. I indicate summarily and quite inadequately some points of M. Benrubi's conclusions."
10.1017/s0031819100045587,Nietzsche and Epicurean Philosophy,"Nietzsche's opinions on philosophy and aesthetics developed under strong and lasting impulses from classical antiquity. These were not always the same, for at various periods in his life Nietzsche placed Heraclitus, Empedocles, Aeschylus, and even Socrates and Plato on the highest summit of wisdom. In his so-called first stage of development the pre-Socratics (especially Heraclitus) were generally his favourite thinkers, and in the third and last stage these same figures tend to come into prominence again. On the other hand, in the works of Nietzsche's second, rationalistic period, when he was particularly influenced by Comte, Voltaire, and Darwin, Socrates and Plato—usually so hated and despised—are mentioned with affection, with gratitude or even with warm enthusiasm; and so, over and over again, is Epicurus."
10.1017/s0031819100045617,Philosophy in Italy,"There has lately been published a posthumous work on “pure realism” by an Italian philosopher who died a little while ago at an early age. He had been working on the book for some time with great concentration of energy, but did not live to finish it. In the form in which it has been edited for publication some parts of it have been developed almost to completion, while others are mere sketches and notes—though not wanting in interest, for they reveal the author's method of working, and expose doubts and difficulties in the immediate form in which they presented themselves to his mind and found the way to a solution. The most complete section is one dealing with the critique of idealism, a critique which, while it is not devoid of ingenuity, is in the main stringent and vigorous, and deserves particularly the consideration of idealists. The principal thesis is that there are two possible solutions of the problem of consciousness. It admits the possibility either that consciousness itself creates its own world, endowing it, thanks to the action of the mind on its own images, with those physical attributes that make it appear external to the subject or independent of the activity by virtue of which it is formed (idealism); or that consciousness is the immediate revelation of the world itself to itself, a revelation that can only consist in a unique act whereby the world establishes itself as identical with itself and as different from itself, as internal and external knowing and known, spirit and nature (realism). At the basis of idealism, according toRanzoli, is the implied presupposition (of the philosophy of Empedocles) that like is conscious only of like, and at the basis of realism is the Anaxagorean presupposition that opposite is conscious of opposite."
10.1017/s0031819100029466,Philosophy in France,"In his two volumes onIntuitive ThoughtProfessor Edouard Le Roy continues his idealistic interpretation of spiritual creativity, and turns from its ‘products’ manifested in biological and human evolution to consider its most intimate character, as it is ‘lived through’ or directly experienced in intuitive and inventive thinking. The whole plan and its execution are determined by two characteristic themes of Bergsonism—intuition and the dynamical schema—though these arerepensèsin a quite original way. “Intuitive thought” and “metaphysical thought,” M.

10.1017/s003181910002845x,The Leadership of Philosophy,"The positions that I would support in regard to the question whether philosophy has any relation to practice are as follows. In the first place, there are certain problems of modern civilization, and those amongst the most crucial, with which philosophy alone can deal. In the second place, in spite of appearances to the contrary, the present age will not be deaf to the voice of philosophy, if it can speak with sufficient clearness and power to secure a hearing. The problems to which I refer do not belong to the sphere of science, in the strict modern sense. Science is triumphant in its own sphere, but it is not concerned primarily with the values of human existence, or the activity of the mind by which they are discovered, pursued, enjoyed."
10.1017/s0031819100028461,"Science, Philosophy and Religion","The subject which has been chosen for me is sufficiently comprehensive. Several years ago I wrote the last of a series of essays in a book calledScience, Religion, and Reality, in which, as requested, I tried to sum up the contributions of the other writers, with reflections of my own. I have also given a short statement of my opinions in the first volume of that interesting book,Contemporary British Philosophy. Lastly, I have tried, in a book published in the autumn of 1933, to consider the religious and philosophical implications of recent scientific theories and discoveries, and particularly of the conviction held by our leading astronomers and mathematicians that the Second Law of Thermodynamics is unassailable, so that the ultimate extinction of the universe as we know it is certain. I showed that the acceptance of this verdict raises important questions for the philosopher and theologian."
10.1017/s0031819100028527,Philosophy in Italy,"F. Enriques and G. de Santillana have begun in collaboration the composition of a general history of scientific thought. The first volume of this work, which has been recently published, is concerned with the science of antiquity,1 and to a large extent covers the same ground as the history of ancient philosophy, as the frontiers of philosophy and natural science, at any rate until the time of Aristotle, were not yet clearly differentiated. But the two historians are interested in bringing into prominence a great many problems and personalities that the history of philosophy generally leaves on one side, although they help to complete and vivify the picture of the mentality of the ancients. Mathematics, medicine, geography, astronomy, applied mechanics, and physics, in short all the particular scientific studies that were just beginning to detach themselves from the parent trunk of general philosophy are studied by the authors in their individual developments and through the personalities of their cultivators. The explanations are clear and simple and can be followed even by readers unversed in science; the information is at first hand and is supplemented by a careful discussion of sources. The scientific questions are not isolated from the historical setting of the civilization of antiquity, but are shown in relation to matters of philosophy, religion, art, and moral and political life. The bibliography, intended for the more purely scientific and technical departments of philosophy, forms a very useful and timely completion of the bibliography of philosophic thought in general."
10.1017/s0031819100028539,Philosophy in Russia,"Philosophical literature in Soviet Russia displays the same arid uniformity as before and is almost entirely confined to the exposition of dialectical materialism. That can be seen from the very titles of the books published within the last year:Dialectical Materialism–the Philosophy of the Proletariat, by V. Pozner;Dialectical Materialism, extracts from Marxist classics, selected by the students of the Institute of Red Professorship;Marxism and Natural Science, a collection of articles;The Problem of Causality in the History of New Philosophy and in Dialectical Materialism, by B. Bogdanov and Mihailov. The latter is a digest of papers read at the seminars on the history of philosophy at the Institute of Red Professorship and does not contain a single original idea or throw any fresh light on what has already been said on the subject by Engels, Lenin, Byhovsky, and others. The very quotations from Engels and Lenin are the same as are generally made in Soviet works on dialectical materialism. Arzhanov'sHegelianism in the Service of German Fascismis a critique of neo-Hegelian theories from the orthodox Marxist point of view. But although Hegel's name is often used merely as a bludgeon against the infidels, the non-Marxists, there is a genuine interest in Hegel's work in U.S.S.R. and a desire to introduce it to the general public. In 1929 the Marx and Engel Institute undertook the publication of a Russian edition of Hegel's works, except his lectures on the “Philosophy of Religion” this year two volumes of Kuno Fisher'sHistory of Modern Philosophy, dealing with Hegel (first translated into Russian by Lossky thirty years ago), have been republished."
10.1017/s0031819100054462,How to Teach Philosophy,"Mr. H. G. Wells once suggested that there should be three professors for every subject: one for research, one to write the textbooks, and one to lecture. There is a good deal of truth in the contention that the best philosopher is seldom the best teacher of philosophy. Although most teachers of philosophy are well aware of the fact that they are not great philosophers, and they are genuinely interested in the teaching of their subject, nevertheless there is a tendency for too much emphasis to rest upon their own researches. In consequence, too little attention has been paid to the technique of teaching philosophy."
10.1017/s0031819100062562,The Biological Approach to Philosophy,"There are many possible ways of approach to philosophy, and there is also an impossible one, though one that has often been tried. That the philosopher can somehow spin his philosophy out of what he finds inside himself; that he has some private internal source of information in virtue of which he can decide what the Universe must be, without needing to take the trouble to look at it, is a belief that dies hard. But it is now dying, if not dead, so that it is hardly necessary to refute it in detail. It should suffice to say that anybody who cherishes the belief will not find anything to interest him in what follows. I shall simply assume that the philosopher is, what we all are to some extent, a spectator of the world and of man's life in it and a commentator on what he sees. Where the philosopher differs from others is in the kind of interest he takes in the facts, not in the kind of facts that are there to be interested in."
10.1017/s0031819100062598,Everyday Philosophy of the Turkish People in Stambul,"Until the very recent days of the Turkish Republic, when every effort is being made to adopt the ways of Western civilization, it has been the picturesque and wellnigh universal custom for shops to carry on their walls small placards, usually framed, and these placards have contained in beautiful Arabic writing verses from the Quran, traditions of Muhammed, rhymed and unrhymed sayings which have for generations been passed down from father to son. Coffee-houses, barber shops, booksellers, grocery stores, pharmacies, candy stores, fruit-stands, private houses even, all have decorated their walls with more or less artistically copied bits of wisdom from the past. In general there is no record of the authors or sources from which the sayings have come. They reflect in some measure also the thought of Turkish society as that thought has been passed on through the centuries. In order to get a picture of social relationships in the old Ottoman state it will perhaps be of value to study these texts and learn what we can from them of the social life and ideals of everyday folk in Constantinople from the earliest days down to the period which is just passing. There was a close relationship between these mottoes and their owners. The mottoes reflected in the first place the life philosophy of those who wrote them, and they served to mould the attitude toward life of successive generations. Not only religious belief, but attitudes toward the world and its problems, toward methods and standards of business dealing, are all touched upon in these texts."
10.1017/s0031819100062604,Philosophy in Italy,"N. Abbagnano has made a wide and exhaustive study of the philosophy of William of Ockham. He has tried to withstand the tendency, generally prevalent in the history of philosophy, to consider Ockham's personality as balanced between the old scholastic and the modern philosophy, and his works as a strange medley of formal subtleties and of profound intuitions born of genius. He has tried to represent him as a thinker with decided leanings towards the modern era, the initiator not so much of nominalism as of English empiricism, and therefore the precursor of Locke and Hume. To carry out his task he was necessarily obliged to dwell on the more positive and reconstructive part of Ockham's writings, neglecting those parts where the Franciscan doctor hesitates and gropes among the old discussions of scholastic formalism. This tends to spoil the balance of the historical reconstruction; but at the same time it must be granted that the newer and more positive parts revealed by Abbagnano's shrewd analysis have an impressive modern trend, not composed of sporadic ideas and vague anticipations, but forming a coherent and organic whole."
10.1017/s0031819100062616,Philosophy in Russia,"Since ‘dialectical’ materialism was proclaimed in Soviet Russia to be the only true conception of reality, the red philosophers found themselves in a worse plight than ever. They have now to guard against the pitfalls of ‘mechanistic’ materialism on the one hand, and of idealism on the other; and as by ‘idealism’ Soviet writers mean almost anything opposed to their own views, it is easy enough to detect traces of it hi any thinker. The wide field thus opened for mutual recriminations, accusations of deviating from ‘the general line of the Party,’ etc., makes any genuine philosophical work even more difficult than it was two or three years ago. There is a marked decrease in the number of philosophical publications. According to theKnizhnaya Letopis(a U.S.S.R. weekly bibliographical survey), all that has appeared in the philosophical line during the last six months of 1932 is a new translation of Spinoza'sLetters, a reprint of an old translation of hisEthics, and a few dozen small textbooks on dialectical materialism, published by various schools, such as the Leningrad School of Engineering, the Leningrad Electro-Mechanical School Combine, and so on. The editorial board of the journalPsychology, which has existed for some years, announces that their programme “is entirely determined by Lenin's principle of observing party considerations in scientific work”; they are resolved “to champion the heritage of Marx and Lenin and to assign psychology a practical part in the building up of a socialist state.”"

I hope to show that this accusation rests on a misunderstanding of his central theory, a misunderstanding which gives God a place both inconsistent with his main premisses and useless in his system. I hope also to display by quotation the real Berkeley, whose theory of God's place and nature is directly supported by argument and consistent with his premisses, and makes (with his account of self) a system which, if it is less than a completely coherent philosophy, is more than an episcopal assumption."
10.1017/s0031819100013231,Towards a New Philosophy,"There is perhaps no part of Kant’sCritique of Pure Reasonwhich has called forth such severe criticism as his deduction of the System of Categories in the Transcendental Analytic. I am not aware of even one among his many followers who holds to this part of Kant’s doctrine. And the reason for this disagreement is obvious. Kant’s deduction of his System of Categories is based on Formal Logic, the theory of syllogism, first laid down by Aristotle. Mediaeval scholars had changed some details and partly systematized the subject. Kant himself had added some finishing touches to produce his famous number of a dozen categories, but the gist of this logical theory was the same as that found in Aristotle’sOrganon."
10.1017/s0031819100013280,Modernism in Science and Philosophy,"There can be little doubt, I think, that the quality and texture of recent scientific and philosophical thought mark a greater break with the past than any innovations such as were introduced by a Gallileo or a Newton, a Descartes or a Kant. The switch over from the logicality and essential rationality of these men to the irrationalisms, the anti-intellectualisms, and the new logics of the moderns, is not at all on the same footing as that deepening of our concepts of knowledge and reality which we associate with the masters of thought, more particularly with the critical philosophy of Kant. Strong and significant as these earlier changes were, they marked but the onward strides of an art of thinking which remained in its essence the same in spite of them. But the thinkers in the public eye to-day are exploring in unknown regions, and it may turn out that they have got beyond their depth. Whatever their fate, it seems undeniable that the experiments that they have made and are making constitute, at points at least, and for the time being, a veritable revolution."
10.1017/s0031819100013243,Hobbes’ Philosophy and its Historical Background,"ThomasHobbesof Malmesbury, one of the greatest philosophers of law and state, died 250 years ago, on December 4, 1679. His name was so frequently associated with a certain unfortunate conception of his moral and political philosophy, that the public's lack of interest in this centenary is not to be wondered at. So far, even amongst the scholars who admitted his merits, few tried to penetrate into the depths of his thought, and only at the end of the last century, thanks to the writings of Ferdinand Tönnies and George Croom Robertson, was a new impulse given to research into Hobbes’ spiritual heritage. A series of monographies was published, and the personality of Hobbes appeared in a new light. His theories, when better known, proved to be less crude and more human than they had seemed, for they are a reaction from the revolutionary tendencies of his time."
10.1017/s0031819100013310,Philosophy in Italy,"Shaftesbury is one of those philosophers who are usually placed more or less in the margin of the history of thought because an insufficient idea of system and a certain looseness of conception make it difficult to grasp their ideas and to classify them. Yet when you are able to break down or to dismiss the mental figures in which you have been accustomed to consider the historical succession of doctrines and are prepared to revive their words with an open mind, not only do they give you in their originality more than you had hoped, but also they help to render your representation of intellectual life as a whole more complex and more harmonious in its development. Bandini,1an Italian scholar, in making a zealous study of Shaftesbury, has succeeded in drawing out his rich personality, and at the same time in explaining the importance of his contribution to theperennis philosophia. We could hardly succeed in understanding the modern English mind in its genesis if we concentrated our attention exclusively on those empiristic currents which, although they preponderate in Anglo-Saxon speculation, do not contain all its originality. There is a deep fount of romance in the spirit of this people which wells up from time to time, and the drier and harder the surface earth the more strongly it gushes forth. Shaftesbury is just such a fount, isolated and inexplicable to all outward appearances, but far otherwise for anyone who knows how to penetrate below the surface. In his essay Bandini, while emphasizing the contrast between the philosophy of moral enthusiasm and feeling and the contemporaneous doctrines of Hobbes and Locke, examines with equal penetration the way in which the former becomes reattached to English speculative tradition and by what means it contributes in its turn to furnishing new trends in philosophy."
10.1017/s0031819100013322,American Philosophy,"In America most of us are so proud of our own achievements and—as a corollary of this—so provincial and narrow-minded in our general worldoutlook, that it has probably never occurred to us that until very recently we have cut absolutely no figure in the world's philosophy. In fact, it may still be said that even in 1930 the influence of American philosophy upon the philosophical world is almost a negligible factor. But even such nearly negligible influence is vastly more than American philosophers could boast of thirty or forty years ago. The fact is that even as late as at the outbreak of the world-war most of Europe hardly knew that there was any such thing as American philosophy. And up to a very few years prior to the beginning of this devastating conflict such judgment concerning the non-existence of American philosophy was probably quite in agreement with the facts of the case. For an understanding of America's present cultural position it is essential, therefore, that one should know something of the recent advances in American philosophy. In fact, such philosophical progress in contemporary America constitutes one of the most remarkable and distinct proofs of America's ability to make significant and appreciated contributions to the highest intellectual and cultural life of the world. It would be foolish were one—even yet—to claim that America has arrived, philosophically. But the signs which indicate that American philosophy is definitely on its way are numerous, and are constantly multiplying. If American philosophers cannot yet say: “Plato, Hume, and Kant, we are here!”"
10.1017/s0031819100031855,The Philosophy of Social Life,"Philosophers less subtle than those of the Middle Ages feel no difficulty about such words as “and” or such phrases as “member of”; but even to write “man and society” has committed us to an assumption which may not be justifiable, and to say that men are “members” of a community or of a trade union is so alarming a metaphor that it would startle Duns Scotus. It is unwise, however, to ask philosophers what they mean when they feel very passionately about what they say, for the confusion becomes even greater than it was if passion gets into explanation. It is supposed to be obvious that men existandthat States and Trade Unions and Churches exist; and who would be so foolish as to raise difficulties about the difference between existence and essence? Many who claim to be scientists with regard to politics or economics suppose it to be obvious that there is an “essence” called “public opinion” or “the will of the people” or “utility”; and what Occamite would now dare to say that entities are not to be multiplied ?"

10.1017/s0031819100017782,Philosophy in France,"The source and inspiration of French “eclecticism” in the first half of last century was historical; its immediate purpose, the reconstitution of philosophical doctrines of the past; its riper though remoter effects, the formation of a tradition which insisted on reinterpretation as an indispensable preliminary to further construction. And it is largely a result of this that we to-day find commonplace the declaration: “A peculiarity of systems that are epoch-making is that their influence should extend beyond their own generation, and that they should prepare, as it were in secret, the thought that is to come.” So far as fuller and comparative scholarship have been applied to the elucidation of Cartesian philosophy and science, the results appear to fall into three groups. First, largely a result of the impetus of Cousin's teaching at the École Normale, there is the ample story of the development and modifications of Cartesianism in Bouillier'sHistoire, and theCartésianismeof Bordas-Demoulin. Later in the century, after the reaction against Cousin, come the invaluable study of Liard, insisting on the greater importance of Descartes' methodology and physics and the priority of the latter over his metaphysics, and the elegant monograph of Fouillee stressing the “voluntarist” tendencies in Descartes."

10.1017/s003181910001072x,Our Present Outlook in Speculative Philosophy,"Speculative Philosophy, or Pure Metaphysic, stands at the present time in a very interesting position. There is perhaps some degree of slackening in the construction of elaborate systems, though, with the recent examples of McTaggart and Professor Alexander before us, this may be open to some question. But at least we probably realize, more fully than was possible in previous generations, the exact nature of the problems with which pure metaphysic is concerned. Its work has been more and more clearly marked off from that of the empirical sciences (including even the more detailed aspects of psychology), and from that of the mathematical sciences (including even the quasi-mathematical aspects of formal logic); and its province can now be definitely confined to the general theory of knowledge and the light that is thrown by this upon the structure of reality. It is my object in this paper to indicate briefly the chief problems that appear to fall within its scope and the chief directions in which we may look for light upon them. It is well to admit, however, that metaphysical problems are difficult, and that any statements that are made about them, unless expressed in language of a somewhat technical character, are very liable to be misunderstood. I must try to avoid both the Scylla of obscurity and the Charybdis of superficiality."

However, he does also pass in review the more recent doctrines, particularly those of J. H. Muirhead, G. H. Howison, D. G. Richtie, J. E. Creighton, J. B. Baillie, J. S. Mackenzie, H. Jones, W. E.

Abbagnano regards as a distinctive trait of English idealism inspired by Hegel as opposed to Hegel himself, this, that “for Hegel the absolute is essentially process, change and becoming; it is thought which differentiates itself and becomes articulate in a life of its own, in the threefold rhythm of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, in which each moment passes into the next. For Green, Bradley, and Royce, the absolute is on the other hand immutability, completeness, static perfection, in which each process and becoming is overcome and resolved.” At any rate, Abbagnano is equally unsympathetic towards Hegel and towards his followers, against whom he opposes, not without scholastic ingenuity, his own irrationalistic views, set out in another book whose contents are sufficiently expressed in the title.1"

10.1017/s0031819100028151,The Value of Philosophy to Religion,"The foundation a year or two ago of the British Institute of Philosophical Studies is an event of real importance in the intellectual life of our country. It is an indication of the widespread interest in ultimate problems which now exists, certainly wider than at any previous time; and it is a means of diffusing that interest more widely still. No doubt there is an almost universal tendency to distrust philosophical “systems” or ready-made interpretations of the universe; but there is a deep and wide concern about the problems with which philosophy is concerned, even if there is little expectation of satisfactory solutions. This state of affairs calls for special attention from those who are convinced of the supreme value of Religion for the guidance of life and the interpretation of the universe."
10.1017/s0031819100017472,Philosophy in Russia,"Somenew information has recently come to light with regard to philosophy in Russia. It appears that it is next to impossible for anyone living there to study the subject or indeed to form an adequate conception of it. There is not a single teacher of philosophy or logic in any of the Universities ; a course of the history of philosophy is only read in theethnologicaldepartment of the Moscow University. It is proposed, however, to introduce the teaching of logic and of the history of philosophy in certain towns “ when a sufficient number of teachers are available,” and with this purpose a department of philosophy at the ‘ Institute of red professorship ’ has been opened. But the qualifications required of the future professors of philosophy make one more than doubtful of their capacity to teach the subject. All that is required of them is that they should have read the first volume of Lange'sHistory of Materialism, Hoffding'sHistory of Modern Philosophy, Gomperz's Greek Thinkers up to Socrates (only the early part of Gomperz's work has been translated into Russian, and the knowledge of foreign languages is not required from the candidates), Wundt'sIntroduction to Philosophy, and the writings of various philosophizing Marxists. In addition to these academic qualifications they must have a recommendation from the communist party or some similar organization. The kind of ideas that are being instilled into these prospective teachers may be gathered from the writings of the accredited ‘ red ’ philosophers in the only philosophical periodical which is being published in Russia,Under the Banner of Marxism, and in other magazines."

Geologists estimate that man evolved some 1,000,000 years ago on an earth which astronomers say is some 2,000,000,000 years old. Caution is required in accepting such figures, for we must remember how far out Lord Kelvin was in estimating the age of the earth—before the discovery of radium. Man has been civilized for some 5,000 years, and Galileo, with his telescope and revolutionary ideas, lived some 300 years ago. There may be, we are told, a million million years before the sun grows weak and the earth becomes farther from the sun so that all life freezes. Long before this man may use up the metals available for his machines, and those ready sources of energy now so wastefully used, by which he at present multiplies and swarms in cities. In such case he will return through birth control or famine, or both, to a simple, uncrowded, pastoral existence. There is little likelihood of his being able to use atomic energy, other than that which reaches the earth as sun radiation and is available directly or as energy stored in water-power, wood, coal, and oil."
10.1017/s0031819100017411,The Philosophy of Melchior Palágyi,"Theguiding idea of Palágyi's Monism is what he has called the Principle of Polarity. This is made clear in Palágyi's own preface to the second edition of his main work, theNaturphilosophische Vorlesungen(N.V.). The lectures were originally given in 1908. The Second Edition and the Preface date from 1924. In this preface we learn that the quest for the creative on the one hand, and for unity through polarity on the other, were ever the two leading motives of his thought. Both are pervasive and permanent, and they support each other; but in so far as the intellectual urge towards unity prevails over the more artistic impulse to creative freedom, it is the principle of polarity that receives the main stress and exercises the greater influence. For Palágyi, as for Hegel, it is the main principle of mental evolution. “ Polarity,” so Palágyi tells us (N.V., p. vii), does not simply mean “ opposition,” the"
10.1017/s0031819100031417,Philosophy and Art,"It is much more certain that the artist can help the philosopher than that the philosopher can help the artist. The purpose of this paper is to indicate the kind of questions about art which the philosopher asks, in order that those whose concern is with art, artists themselves in the first instance, and critics of art, may judge if these questions are interesting to them, and if so may co-operate with the philosophers in seeking to answer them. Now that the sciences and the other occupations of man become so sharply separated from each other, philosophy has come to have a peculiar position. It deals with the questions which are left over from the sciences, and this gives it a specific and important office to perform."
10.1017/s0031819100031466,Philosophy of Social Life: III. Culture and Institutions,"Poppies in a field of corn may annoy a farmer and rejoice an artist. Clearly they are not in their right place, if the standard of judgment be immediate utility; but it is better that they should be accidentally there than nowhere at all to be found. The political organization of social life and, still more obviously, the economic, does not promote devotion to other purposes than those which appear to be practical in the eyes of men who cannot see very well. To suppose, for example, that beauty or truth is not useful is the result of philosophical nearsightedness. But there are some men, women, and children who are moved deeply by beauty and the divine whose emotion is not easily understood in political terms and is altogether unintelligible in terms of exchange-value."
10.1017/s0031819100031065,Gentile's Philosophy of the Spirit,"Gentile's philosophy merits the attention of every serious thinker, for it presents the doctrine that reality is spiritual in a more uncompromising form than is to be found elsewhere, and claims to solve on this principle all the great problems that have beset the history of metaphysic. His own name for it is Absolute or Actual Idealism (Idealismo assoluto or attuale). For Gentile, nothing is real but the Spirit, and by the Spirit he means the pure act of self-conscious thinking. “The subject that conceives itself in conceiving All is the reality itself.” In the act of conscious thinking, the Spirit is present in its entirety as subject (Io universale, transcendentale, assoluto); generating therein by its own creative spontaneity a world of objects, and resolving the products of this act of objectification into the womb that gave them birth. In this immanent dialectic–pure subject (thesis), pure object (antithesis), subject-object (synthesis)–lies the rhythmic life-history of the Spirit. “Our doctrine,” writes Gentile, “is the theory of the Spirit as act which posits its object in a multiplicity of objects, resolving their multiplicity and objectivity in the unity of the subject itself.” For such a doctrine, transcendence is the enemy, the Goliath whom Gentile has gone forth to slay. He confronts us, on almost every page of his writings, with an ineluctable dilemma. Either a philosophy of sheer immanence, or reality is unknowable."

For in spite of the manifold difficulties that stood in the way of instituting a school of philosophical study in London, what has been achieved here, both in the way of original investigation and of effective teaching, constitutes a record of which we may well be proud."
10.1017/s0031819100031119,The Philosophy of Social Life,"Only one adult in a hundred gets his food and clothing without doing anything directly in exchange for them. The other ninety-nine form active parts of the system of relations in society which will be called, in what follows here, economic; and even the one in the hundred who does not give, takes something, as children and imbeciles take, out of the store of services which are economic life. Boots and bread are but the bridges over which one man is connected with another, through services exchanged. The philosophy of social life, therefore, must “place” these economic relations in the whole complex unity of human experience. The science of economics analyses some of the aspects of the relations of men in exchanging services, and it provides a language which is already sufficiently current to be used here without full explanation of the terms. Therefore, without more ado, the philosophical aspects of the economic system may be considered in the terms of economic science, but outside the frontiers proper to that partial analysis."
10.1017/s0031819100027820,The Philosophy of Social Life: Political Organization,"The life of man in society provides the subject-matter for many different sciences. It is analysed usually by reference to the kind of relation which connects men; and so, if men buy or sell one from the other, economics gives an account of the factors in such a relation; if a policeman directs traffic and the citizen obeys, political science explains government. But clearly no one of these relations between men is altogether independent of the others. Social life is the whole complex of human relations, and there is no man at all who is not thoroughly social. The fundamental fact of mental life life is not the atomic but the related individual. No mind exists which is not in contact with other minds; and there is no mind whose fundamental characteristics are not social."

These developments have altered almost every aspect of material life—they have certainly had great influence upon modern education, and upon modern ideas of politics, as well as upon a host of less important things. But chief of all we notice the effect of this Golden Age of Science in the birth of new ideas. The revolution in ideas has only just started. Where it will end no one can see."
10.1017/s0031819100028126,Peace Without Victory—in Philosophy,"That European and American philosophy at the opening of the twentieth century should have been sharply controversial was not an accident of politics, any more than it was accidental that persecutions and inquisitions should have attended the history of Christianity. The jealous God of Christianity was by definition an only god whose claims implies the rejection or subordination of every other god. Those who were not exclusively with him were counted against him. “ Christian “ and “ anti-Christian “ constituted a complete disjunction. Similarly, the effect of the philosophy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was to define sharp and conflicting antitheses. Its gods were jealous gods. Differences were irreconcilable oppositions, which could be overcome only through the conquest of one by another, or through their joint abdication in favour of a third party. But there are many signs of a changed temper of mind. The most recent philosophy seeks to escape such hostilities by avoiding the initial antitheses, or by bringing to light original communities and identities which have been lost sight of in the excessive sharpening of distinctions."

Many of them have been engulfed in the routine of business life, and such hours as they could devote to philosophic reflexion have been snatched from intervals of leisure which the majority of business men relinquish to recreation and rest. The friend to whose memory I wish to pay my humble tribute would not have claimed for himself, nor have permitted his associates to claim for him, the distinction of having initiated a new line of speculative reflexion. But, if he did not propound any original metaphysical theory, he possessed, in quite unusual measure, the"
10.1017/s0031819100023548,Practical Issues and Social Philosophy,"“No man can see farther into a generalization than his knowledge of detail extends.” That saying of William James is true of all the branches of science; but it has a special value for students of social philosophy. Social life is so obviously a matter of personal experience that an academic Robinson Crusoe may easily be less competent in his knowledge of detail than a business man, if the business man thinks at all. This is not a compliment to the business man, nor an insult to the academic scholar; for the majority of those who deal with practical issues seem to be far more incompetent than the majority of scholars. But it is essential for social philosophy that practical experience of some kind should be used. Indeed, just as a student of chemistry nowadays depends at every step upon experiment, so a student of social life should take care to play a part in some form of active social life, whether as directing, co-operating, or obeying. One cannot get chemistry out of books; still less can one find social philosophy there. Therefore the number of books written or read is no criterion of the vigour of social philosophy in any generation—it is so easy to write books about other books, and so easy to read the same material many times."
10.1017/s0031819100025791,An Essay in Catholic Philosophy,The critical attacks of Philosophy upon the Catholic Faith which have developed since the eighteenth century have at last forced the defenders of that religion to consider the metaphysical foundations of their belief. This is all to the good; the disastrous attempt to separate belief from the searching questions of Reason has resulted in confusion and embarrassment both to Faith and Philosophy.
10.1017/s0031819100025808,Philosophy and Science,"We can put our view briefly by saying that when the scientist has no more doubts, the philosopher will have none either; and that when the philosopher is completely satisfied, the scientist will agree with him. But since such an end is countless years ahead and may never arrive, it is perhaps better to say that the philosopher and the scientist are pursuing the same end, and that the task involves both the elaboration of proper conceptions and the investigation of the events of the universe by the aid of these conceptions."
10.1017/s0031819100014972,The Social Philosophy of Smith's “wealth of Nations”,"When Adam Smith, at the age of forty, resigned his professorship in Glasgow and devoted himself, after three years of travel, to the composition of his Wealth of Nations, he set himself to elaborate the sociological portion of his course on Moral Philosophy. Indeed, at the conclusion of his Moral Sentiments, written during the tenure of his professorship, he had promised “ another discourse ” on the “ general principles of law and government,” including a historical treatment and an account of “ police, revenue and arms.” To be sure, when the work appeared, it was not, in essentials, a continuation of the researches of Montesquieu, and had no authentic connection with Smith’s earlier treatise on morals, Instead, the bulk of it was a strict, and as we should say, a scientific (not a philosophical), inquiry into the origin and conditions of opulence in human communities. Nevertheless, it expounds and is even dominated by a certain social philosophy which is not too convincing when nakedly put. Smith's abiding fame, accordingly, rests more upon the strict scientific analysis of his book than upon its implicit philosophy. Still, the philosophy was there. It had, and it still has, influence. A short discussion of it, therefore, is likely to have something more than historical interest."

10.1017/s0031819100023524,Main Currents of Contemporary Philosophy in Italy,"Of late years, even in Italy, no really new personalities or original orientations of thought have made their appearance in philosophy. The best that has been done in our studies consists in ample work consolidating the mental positions already gained during the prewar period, and in slow but unceasing efforts of philosophic thought to permeate the other strata of our culture. It is not paradoxical to affirm that to-day the best fruits of the renewed philosophic education are to be gathered not in books of philosophy, but in books of literary and artistic criticism, of history, and of political and moral science. All this is not merely fortuitous, but proceeds directly and consciously from the trend of the new Italian philosophic thought, which shrinks from isolating itself in an intellectual and fictitious superworld, preferring on the contrary to be a living methodology of the sciences, and to give to its universals the relief and, I might almost say, the savour, of particular things."
10.1017/s003181910001473x,The Present Outlook in Social Philosophy,"There has been a great deal of valuable work done in the department of Social Philosophy in recent years; and, though much of it has been of a controversial character, it seems possible to indicate some leading conceptions about which there is not now very much difference of opinion, and which may be taken as furnishing a firm basis for future work. Many of the older conceptions—such as the Divine Right of Kings, the Social Contract, and the unqualified emphasis on either Liberty or Equality—have either passed into complete oblivion or are maintained in forms so greatly modified as to be hardly recognizable. Some others are perhaps just on the point of disappearing; but the following conceptions and special problems in which they are involved may be singled out as still retaining a certain degree of vitality."

But the philosopher is not the only man who wonders about things. It might perhaps be going too far to say that all men experience the feeling, for some men seem to plod on their weary round without curiosity enough to wonder at anything, whilst others, being comfortable, are satisfied to take things for granted, and never think of wondering at them."
10.1017/s0031819100015722,Present Tendencies in Speculative Philosophy,"According to Plato, it is the aim of Philosophy to furnish us with a certain vision of all time and all existence. This must always have seemed a large and difficult undertaking; but the opening years of the present century have already introduced considerable changes in our estimation of magnitudes. We are learning to think of modes of existence that are much more minute and of others that are much larger than any that had previously been conceived with any definiteness. Analysis now leads us to entities and processes that are almost inconceivably small; and synthesis points to a totality that is almost inconceivably great, and that may be even greater than we know. Our interests naturally begin with our human lives on earth ; and we are rapidly discovering that even these have to be thought of in ways that were hardly possible for any previous generation. In a sense, it may be said that our human world has been becoming much smaller. Distances within it are beginning to seem, in many respects, almost negligible ; and great hopes may be based upon this contraction."

But the film itself presents the question of HAL's ‘real feelings’ as something no one can truthfully answer. One way to begin negotiating this contradiction is by attending anew to the way the Jupiter Mission episode, in which HAL appears, is cut to the Adagio from Khachaturian's balletGayane, the excerpt that remains the least discussed in this renowned compilation score. Suggesting that the elusive affect of this music, as it is deployed through several interrelated scenes, brings focus to questions of emotion and embodiment that fundamentally inform the conflict between human and machine, I go on to offer a new hearing of HAL's unforgettable death song ‘Daisy Bell’ in this light, and to re-evaluate some of the director's own words about his film. Ultimately, I carry the same questions forward to inform a contribution to the ongoing debate about the Nietzschean philosophical inflections occasionally thought to enter the film with its much more famous cue from Richard Strauss'sAlso sprach Zarathustra."

But in a surviving letter, written while he was still working on the manuscript of that Treatise, Hume wrote: ‘I am at present castrating my work, that is, cutting off its nobler parts; that is, endeavouring it shall give as little offence as possible, before which I would not pretend to put it in the Doctor's hands’. Enclosed with this letter were some ‘Reasonings concerning Miracles’, which must have anticipated what became Section X of our Enquiry. Presumably there were other excised anticipations also.

10.1075/target.21.1.03wei,Philosophy of translation meets translation studies: Three Hebrew translations of Kipling’s “If” in light of Paul Ricœur’s “Third Text” and Gideon Toury’s “Adequate Translation”,"Though there are no clear-cut boundaries between the philosophy of translation and translation studies, they are obviously not the same. They differ not only in how they address their subject matter but also in that they occupy different “niches” in the culture. In the terminology of Bourdieu, they partake in different, though possibly partly overlapping cultural fields. This article attempts to create a meeting place for two representatives of these disciplines: Paul Ricoeur, a leading figure in French hermeneutics of the 20th century, and Gideon Toury, a prominent researcher in the field of translation studies. Ricoeur’s concept of the (non-existing) “third text” is compared with Toury’s concept of “the adequate translation as a hypothetical construct”, which was proposed in the 1980s and negated in the 1990s; and Ricoeur’s view of translation as “equivalence without adequacy” is compared with Toury’s stand on this issue. The possibility of working with both and reading each of them in light of the other is examined by applying their ideas to a test case — three Hebrew translations of Kipling’s “If”. The underlying assumption is that establishing links between translation studies and the philosophy of translation can contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon, which is the subject matter of both."

It points out that Brouwer's special conception of human consciousness spawns his positive ontological and epistemic doctrines as well as his negative program. The second part focuses on intuitionistic logic: once again a brief picture of the technical field will precede the philosophical analyses—this time those of Heyting and Dummett—of formal intuitionistic logic and its role in intuitionism. The third part, however, aims to show that matters aren't (or needn't be) so bleak. It suggests, in particular, that putting all this in historical perspective will show intuitionism as technically less quixotic and philosophically more unified than it had initially seemed."

There is scarcely a natural or a social science that does not have substantial mathematics prerequisites. The burden on any complete philosophy of mathematics is to show how mathematics is applied to the material world, and to show how the methodology of mathematics (whatever it may be) fits into the methodology of the sciences (whatever it may be). In addition to its role in science, mathematics itself seems to be a knowledge-gathering activity. The philosophy of mathematics is, at least in part, a branch of epistemology. However, mathematics is at least prima facie different from other epistemic endeavors."

Given that mathematical ontology includes quantifiable empirical objects, how to explain the paradigmatic features of pure mathematical reasoning: universality, certainty, necessity. And, without giving up the special status of pure mathematical reasoning, how to explain the ability of pure mathematics to come into contact with and describe the empirically accessible natural world. The first question comes to a demand for apriority: a viable philosophical account of early modern mathematics must explain the apriority of mathematical reasoning. The second question comes to a demand for applicability: a viable philosophical account of early modern mathematics must explain the applicability of mathematical reasoning. This article begins by providing a brief account of a relevant aspect of early modern mathematical practice, in order to situate philosophers in their historical and mathematical context."

He published in his lifetime only a short review (1913) and the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921), a work whose impact on subsequent analytic philosophy's preoccupation with characterizing the nature of logic was formative. Wittgenstein's reactions to the empiricistic reception of his early work in the Vienna Circle and in work of Russell and Ramsey led to further efforts to clarify and adapt his perspective, stimulated in significant part by developments in the foundations of mathematics of the 1920s and 1930s; these never issued in a second work, though he drafted and redrafted writings more or less continuously for the rest of his life."

It argues that his seemingly puzzling doctrine that sentences denote objects, namely, truth-values, emerges from considerations about the logic of sentential connectives and the semantics of predicates and embodies an understanding of why, as Frege sees it, logic is so intimately concerned with the notion of truth. The article then turns to Frege's notion of a thought and, more generally, the distinction between sense and reference."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199552238.003.0003,Philosophy of Language in the Twentieth Century,"During the first half of the twentieth century philosophy took a ‘linguistic turn’. (The phrase, which comes from Gustav Bergmann, was made famous by Richard Rorty as the title of an anthology of papers in which this development is set out and assessed.) The first clear signal of this development was Ludwig Wittgenstein's remark in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921) that ‘All philosophy is “Critique of Language”‘ and this work by Wittgenstein (which is discussed in this article) remains a classic presentation of the thesis that philosophy can only be undertaken through the critical study of language. Thus during the twentieth century philosophical approaches to language, the kinds of theorizing now known as ‘philosophy of language’, have been developed in a context in which language has been taken to be a primary resource for philosophy, and as a result there has been a two-way relationship in which conceptions of language and of philosophy have been developed together."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195189254.003.0001,Introduction: The New Philosophy of Economics,"This article outlines a vision of what philosophy of economics should be. Its focus is on economic science, as opposed to the somewhat broader field taken by the philosophy of economics in general. In drawing this distinction, it follows Lionel Robbins, whose Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science had its seventy-fifth anniversary of publication celebrated in 2007. Economists are far less preoccupied with abstract, grand, unified theories than they once were. Therefore, philosophers of economics should be less interested in this, too. Led by Nancy Cartwight and others, this was a conclusion many philosophers of science had arrived at independently. But this has led many to criticize economics because they did not quickly pick up on changes taking place in economics graduate curricula or circulating working papers. The new, situational, and pragmatic economics beautifully exemplifies the themes that philosophers of sciences had recently gathered from other disciplines."

It argues that the emergentist approach, for which reduction is necessary but insufficient to understand the higher level properties of the self, provides the strongest option for guiding the present ethical debate concerning BMI. The article suggests that BMI constitutes groundbreaking therapeutic interventions because it leads to a more complete ethical analysis that includes scientific, normative, and cultural considerations."

He suggested that the navigator's trade is not just a changing trade, but a vanishing one. He proposed then, and subsequently in his 1993 Anderson Memorial Lecture (reproduced as the previous paper in this issue of the Journal), that consideration should be given to the future of navigation, the future of the navigator and the future of the Institute.In this contribution, papers and addresses over the history of the Institute are examined critically to extract insights into navigation applicable to the present era. These are used to discuss and develop the meanings of the terms ‘navigator’ and ‘navigation’."

10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195309799.001.0001,The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Cognitive Science,"Recent research across the disciplines of cognitive science has exerted a profound influence on how many philosophers approach problems about the nature of mind. These philosophers, while attentive to traditional philosophical concerns, are increasingly drawing both theory and evidence from empirical disciplines — both the framing of the questions and how to resolve them. However, this familiarity with the results of cognitive science has led to the raising of an entirely new set of questions about the mind and how we study it, questions which not so long ago philosophers did not even pose, let alone address. This book offers an overview of this burgeoning field that balances breadth and depth, with articles covering every aspect of the psychology and cognitive anthropology. Each article provides a critical and balanced discussion of a core topic while also conveying distinctive viewpoints and arguments. Several of the articles are co-authored collaborations between philosophers and scientists."
10.5586/asbp.2012.015,Evolutionary aesthetics as a meeting point of philosophy and biology,"Metaphysics, or the knowledge of what there is, has been traditionally placed at the pinnacle of philosophical hierarchy. It was followed by theory of knowledge, or epistemology. Practical knowledge of proper modes of conduct, ethics, came third, followed by aesthetics, treated usually in a marginal way as having to do only with the perception of the beautiful. The hierarchy of philosophical disciplines has recently undergone a substantial transformation. As a result, ethics has assumed a central role. The aim of this paper is to suggest that the hierarchy of philosophical disciplines is not yet complete and that one further step needs to be taken. According to the claim advocated here, it is not metaphysics, epistemology or ethics, but aesthetics that is the first and foremost of all philosophical disciplines. This claim is argued for by references to findings of evolutionary aesthetics, especially to Charles Darwin's idea of sexual selection as elaborated in The Descent of Man. I also argue that Darwinian approach to morality is, and should be, derivable from an Darwinian aesthetics which lies at the core of his conception of sexual selection."
10.1017/bec.2012.3,"Behavioural Activation Therapy: Philosophy, Concepts, and Techniques","Behavioural Activation (BA) therapy is a stand-alone evidence-based treatment for depression and also is being applied to anxiety with promising outcomes. Essentially, BA involves structured therapy aimed at increasing the amount of activity in a person's daily life, so that he or she comes into contact with sources of positive reinforcement for clinically healthy behaviours. Originally, contemporary BA was developed as a behaviour therapy treatment condition in a study that compared BA to Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Over time, many variants of BA have appeared in the published literature, which included techniques that might be viewed as being incompatible with the original intended treatment model and more similar to generic forms of CBT. The purpose of this article is to provide researchers and practitioners with a description of what we consider to be the distinctive and essential elements of BA therapy."

After introducing the claims of this interdisciplinary exercise and after addressing the problems involved in crossing the boundaries between philosophy and psychotherapy, the article elaborates on  Alex Howard’s (2000) [Philosophy for counselling and psychotherapy: Pythagoras to post-modernism. London: Macmillan] attempt to make explicit use of philosophy in psychotherapy, using his interpretation and application of Heraclitus’ philosophy as case study."
10.4102/ids.v36i2.505,Of light and limits: Philosophy matters,"The deepest religious or faith commitments of a scholar enter into her theoretical work through the mediation of a (scientific) world view with its embedded philosophical assumptions about the subject matter. These philosophical assumptions are about the fundamental structure (order) of the world and imply assumptions about the nature of this order or structure. They are often embedded in theoretical notions that purport not to require any further grounding. As such they are thoroughly “religious”. Metaphorical language and models often mediate these religious convictions. Christian scholarship implies critically weighing and assessing such assumptions and exposing their ideological or mythical nature. The pivotal issue at the centre of the historical “turns” in philosophy of science appears to be diverse articulations of this locus of order. It is this perennial search for the elusive universal that surfaces in each of the “turns” in either philosophy or science which “turns” up with monotonous regularity in subject-related literature. All these “turns” seem to be bound in their point of departure to an epistemological position which could best still be described as that of modernity, i.e., anchored in the Enlightenment ideal of the subject-object divide and the belief that objective rational knowledge can be acquired, yet attempting to approach this rational objective knowledge via the medium of the knowing subject. This perennial search for the elusive universal reaches a dead-end in post-modernism. If Christian philosophy wants to shed light on this issue so central to the heart of theorizing, it needs to develop a dynamic understanding of the notion of law, order, limits and boundaries and the way such an understanding could inform the discussions concerning scientific realism and the end(s) of philosophy."
10.1017/s1049096512000728,When Plato Meets Popkin: Combining Political Philosophy and Empirical Content in the Classroom,"AbstractGiven that students often express a desire for course content to be more “relevant” and applicable to their lives, I describe one method for effectively addressing this concern through the organization of the course syllabus. The content of empirically driven courses can be framed within the context of philosophically driven normative questions. In other words, instructors can explicitly construct course narratives that frame the empirically based course content as an attempt to answer (or, at least, shed new light on) important, relevant, and on-going questions raised by political philosophy. I offer examples from two of my own courses, Political Psychology and Local Politics, and discuss the various pedagogical and instructional advantages of such a method."

10.4102/curationis.v24i1.802,A comparison between medicine from an African (Ubuntu) and Western philosophy,I consider the Ubuntu way of caring for the sick in terms of the Ubuntu world-view by systematizing the scattered views. I argue that this world-view is underpinned by the regulative concept of sharing and that caring in Ubuntuthinking can only be understood correctly in terms of sharing. I substantiate my exposition in terms of what Africans themselves claim Ubuntu is and relate its meaning to African thinking in general. I consider the uniqueness of this world-view by showing how an African thinker compares it to Western world-views on causality and critically consider these comparisons. I apply this world-view to African medicine and evaluate the Ubuntu idea of causes in medicine in comparison with causality in Western thinking by considering the two frameworks of medical care in terms of their viability respectively. I conclude that causal patterns in medicine are controversial in both thinkings but argue that it sets the framework for intercultural communication that can lead both to a better understanding of each other and to some positive developments in medicine. These ways of dealing with the topic represents the significance of this article as an addition to existing knowledge.

10.21580/ws.25.2.2025,The Transcendent Unity Behind the Diversity of Religions and Religiosity in the Perspective of Perennial Philosophy and Its Relevance to the Indonesian Context,"&lt;p&gt;This study is conducted to answer an important question: is there any transcendent unity behind the diversity or plurality of religions and religiosity? This question will be answered through perennial philosophy approach. The study found that, according to perennial philosophers, there is a transcendent unity behind the diversity or plurality of religions and religiosity. This transcendent unity is seen in ‘the common vision’, or what in Islam is called the ‘basic message of religion’, namely ‘submission’ to always fear God and live His presence in everyday life. Further, the perennial philosophers argue that the True God is one; therefore, all religions emerging from the One are in principle the same for they come from the same source. In other words, the diversity of religions and religiosity lies only in the exoteric level, and all religions actually have a transcendent unity in the esoteric level. However, in this case, the perennial philosophers do not mean to unify or equate all religions. In fact, they try to open a way to a spiritual ascent through the reviving of the religious traditions in every religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk menjawab sebuah pertanyaan penting: adakah kesatuan transenden di balik keragaman atau pluralitas agama dengan religiusitas? Pertanyaan ini akan dijawab melalui pendekatan filsafat perennial. Penelitian ini menemukan bahwa, menurut para filsuf perennial, ada kesatuan transenden di balik keragaman atau pluralitas agama dan religiusitas. Kesatuan transenden ini terlihat dalam pandangan bersama, atau apa yang di dalam Islam disebut pesan dasar agama, yaitu tunduk untuk selalu takut kepada Tuhan dan menjalani kehadiran-Nya dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Selanjutnya, para filsuf perennial berpendapat bahwa Tuhan yang Sejati adalah satu. Oleh karena itu, semua agama yang muncul dari Yang Satu pada prinsipnya sama karena mereka berasal dari sumber yang sama. Dengan kata lain, keragaman agama dan religiusitas hanya terletak pada tingkat eksoteris, dan semua agama benar-benar memiliki kesatuan transenden di tingkat esoteris. Namun, dalam kasus ini, filsuf perennial tidak bermaksud menyatukan atau menyamakan semua agama. Sebenarnya, mereka mencoba membuka jalan menuju pendakian spiritual melalui kebangkitan kembali tradisi keagamaan di setiap agama.&lt;/p&gt;"

This essay is not meant as a definition or an explanation of demonic creation, but instead presents a demonic work par excellence, as the term ""demonic"" is defined by Goethe in the Elegy from Marienbad. The process of the creation of this work, as it is described by Goethe, also represents a strange exorcism, as the entire daemonic creative force of the author is transposed in this lyrical masterpiece of German and universal literature. After writing the Elegy Goethe, it is no longer demonic."

It suggests that although Coleridge did not leave behind an original, coherent philosophical system or a single finished book which could be called a philosophical work, he has somehow acquired the reputation of being the most philosophical of the British Romantic poets. The article discusses doubts concerning Coleridge's qualifications as an original philosophical thinker. Renée Wellek, for example, remarked on the fundamental weakness of his thought– incoherence and indistinctness–and considered the study of Coleridge's philosophy to be futile."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199280322.013.0030,Jewish Philosophy and Theology,"The academic study of Jewish philosophy and theology is bedevilled by definitional and methodological ambiguities. There are scholars who hold that the very concept of Jewish philosophy is dubious. For if by its nature philosophy addresses universal truth-claims, then it cannot be modified by any delimiting national, ethnic, or religious attribute. The multivalent character of the concept of Jewish thought, designed to complement the rather circumscribed notion of Jewish philosophy, eventually led to the establishment at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem of two separate but parallel departments: the Department of Jewish Philosophy and Kabbalah, and the Department of the History of Jewish Thought. The former tended to limit its purview to medieval sources, emphasizing rigorous philological and text-critical methods. The latter had a pronounced preference for the methods of intellectual history and had a larger thematic scope."

His life was prolonged for several years after nearly all of his early friends had passed away; and since his death many papers have been destroyed or have fallen aside, which would now be of the greatest interest.Whilst in this way much has been lost that might have given greater completeness to these pages, still, the recent publication of the Diary of his friend Dr Carlyle of Inveresk, has furnished many additional details, and afforded further evidence of the estimation in which he was held by his literary associates.Several letters selected from the lives of his distinguished friends, and from the Manuscript Collection of the University, in addition to information derived from the short notices of his life already printed, have afforded the materials for preparing this sketch of one, whose career was more varied, while his public labours and literary connections were not less important and extensive, than those of any of his contemporaries."

A text on Graeco-Arabic philosophy and Sufism that he wrote under court patronage,Rawdat al-Taʿrif fi al-Hubb al-Sharif(The Garden of Knowledge of Noble Love), became the centerpiece of a famous court case against him that led to his downfall. Historians have had difficulty interpreting the case because of its political context. Was Ibn al-Khatib's demise really about his philosophical and mystical ideas given his entanglement in power rivalries at the court? Scholars have suggested that Ibn al-Khatib's text was used merely as a pretext to remove him from power. In contrast, I argue that the specific power rivalry between the chief qadi and Ibn al-Khatib only escalated into a court case because, at a time when Sufis were controversial, the qadi read Ibn al-Khatib's Sufi-inspired doctrines as a claim on his religious authority. Ibn al-Khatib's ideas, rather than a pretext for prosecution, were the necessary condition for the power rivalry to erupt into a court case. This reading of the case highlights the way intellectual debates shaped contingent political processes in the medieval Islamic world."
10.19090/arhe.2016.25.171-184,CONFLICT AND DEVELOPMENT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF COMPARATIVE PHILOSOPHY,"U istočnoj i zapadnoj filozofiji uveliko su razmatrana pitanja sukoba, rešavanja sukoba, razvoja, rata, mira itd. Uobičajena osa mnogih teorija jeste ljudski faktor, način na koji individua sagledava te fenomene i način na koji oni utiču na nju. U tim teorijama postoji pokušaj uspostavljanja radne veze između onoga praktičkog i onoga idealnog. Dok sukob može biti osnov ili za društveni razvoj ili za nerazvijanje, on takođe potvrđuje perspektivu o postojanju vrednosti koje su na koncu intrinzične moralnim i političkim poboljšanjima. Takve vrednosti za cilj imaju usmerenje prosperiteta i blagostanja, koje ostaje ekumenski i dijahronijski problem, i to ne samo u ekonomskom smislu. Ljudska društva su još uvek suočena s dilemom da li je materijalni napredak prečica za razrešenje sukoba. Ono što je, međutim, još uvek zanemareno, kao što je pokazano u komparativno-filozofskoj literaturi, jeste to što razvoj u obzir mora uzeti bogatiji pojam ljudskog bića; onaj koji brine o elementima njegove unutrašnje stvarnosti. U tom smislu, razvoj nije samo posledica izbegavanja rata ili sukoba, nego bogaćenja ljudskog života i čina praćenog izvesnim unapređenjima u individualnoj i kolektivnoj vrlini, unapređenjima koja nude makroskopsku dobit onome političkom."

Given that ‘law and economics’ is a category that covers a large and diverse set of theories and theorists, and that ‘moral philosophy’ as a category is even larger and more diverse, there are a vast number of potential topics and perspectives. The article offers a sample of the many intersections of those two categories. Part I offers a brief introduction to some central ideas of economics and to the different schools of moral philosophy. Part II summarizes some defences of law and economics from the perspective of moral philosophy, while Part III summarizes criticisms from the same source."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199286140.013.0045,Low Philosophy,"Philosophy in an Aristotelian vein speaks a language almost of its own making, with unusual words such as substance, accident, matter, form, actuality, potentiality, entelechy, and the like. The ideal here seems to be that philosophy speaks directly to the mortal devotee, who loses himself in that higher music. And yet there are other dimensions to ancient thinkers, even the systematic ones, which sit uneasily with such a high philosophy. This article sketches its opposite and calls a philosophy ‘low’ when it tends to focus not on a completed architectonic, but on the living thinker; not on necessary or universal thoughts, but on the lived particulars that inspire, ground, and transcend them; not on the eternal and objective, but on the immediate and subjective. What a thinker is, does, and says is more important than books, formal arguments, and system building. In brief, a low philosophy concentrates upon character and its perfection."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199286140.013.0046,High Philosophy,"This article traces the sense of ‘higher’ – exclusivity of audience and assimilation to higher principles – along a spectrum. The lowest point on this spectrum is the Epicurean school. Among the philosophers considered, the Epicureans also addressed themselves to the widest audience. Yet their moral ideal involves at least a structural similarity to the Neoplatonists' goal of becoming like god. On such criteria, they count as proponents of ‘higher philosophy’. A high philosophy stresses reason, system, treatises, the rare intelligence of elites, and their organized work through schools, museums, and libraries."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199232116.013.0012,Philosophy and Genocide,"This article poses genocide as a philosophical problem, reviewing some of the ways philosophers have addressed genocide and then, by using the work of Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno, suggests an alternative way in which they can proceed further. First, it raises the question as to why philosophers have been prone to not discussing genocide. Answering this question goes a long way in helping to understand what philosophy can and cannot do in analysing genocide. Genocide re-enters the philosophical frame as a distinctly modern, but nonetheless ultimately human possibility — one that has a particular genealogy and one that can be explored via its underpinnings in a complex network of philosophical commitments and positions."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195309799.013.0001,Introduction: Philosophy and Cognitive Science,"This chapter offers a high-level overview of the philosophy of cognitive science and an introduction toThe Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Cognitive Science. The philosophy of cognitive science emerged out of a set of common and overlapping interests among philosophers and scientists who study the mind. We identify five categories of issues that illustrate the best work in this broad field: (1) traditional philosophical issues about the mind that have been invigorated by research in cognitive science, (2) issues regarding the practice of cognitive science and its foundational assumptions, (3) issues regarding the explication and clarification of core concepts in cognitive science, (4) first-order empirical issues where philosophers participate in the interdisciplinary investigation of particular psychological phenomena, (5) traditional philosophical issues that aren’t about the mind but that can be informed by a better understanding of how the mind works."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195309799.013.0022,Experimental Philosophy,"The aim of the article is to review existing work in experimental philosophy. The experimental philosophy seeks to examine the phenomena that have been traditionally associated with philosophy using the methods that have more recently been developed within cognitive science. Conceptual analysis frequently relies on appeals to intuition, but it is rarely made clear precisely whose intuitions are being discussed. The emphasis in cross-cultural work in experimental philosophy has been shifting toward the study of moral judgments, with papers exploring cross-cultural differences in intuitions about consequentialism and moral responsibility. Philosophers have been working on the relationship between moral responsibility and determinism. One of the key points of contention is whether moral responsibility and determinism are compatible or incompatible. Philosophers working within the framework of the analytic project have long engaged in the study of people's intuitions, but their real interest has not typically been in human beings and the way they think. They work to understand the true nature of the properties and relations that people's concepts pick out. Some philosophers believe that the most important and fundamental issues are somehow getting overlooked as researchers turn more and more to empirically informed work in cognitive science."
10.21834/aje-bs.v2i2.179, Islamic Philosophy on Behaviour-Based Environmental Attitude,"This paper concludes philosophical elements regarding conceptual theory, significances of human attitude towards the environment. In a sustainable life, environmental management becomes the most crucial area to be concerned. There are many campaigns, courses and even legal enforcement to ensure the success of educating wise attitude towards environment. This could be more effective and will create eternal effects if the understanding of environmental attitude would be based on religious teachings and philosophy. Not only for Muslims, these theoretical principles were described by the Holy Book, supported with the Prophet’s tradition which could also be practiced by all mankind. The Great Sustainer is the best provider of the guidelines in interacting with all entities in our environment. In addition, they are closely related to the concept of rewards, directly or delayed. This paper highlighted a conceptual framework to be understood, in order to guide the do’s and don’ts, good or bad habits and positive or negative behavior towards environmental entities, including metaphysical entities. The most important point is, this philosophy would be a platform towards designing approaches, strategies or activities towards inculcating good behavior towards environment.&#x0D;

the interpretation of the essence of these theories. The terminology of the personnel management sphere is clari ed.The substitution of “personnel management” &#x0D;

Essentially the person is not a resource, but the bearer of resources (intellectual resources). A human is the creator of the resources he produces for constructive &#x0D;
activity. The article characterizes the factors in  uencing personnel in the process of labor activity, reveals the essence of the concept of “hard management”, &#x0D;

management is evaluated."
10.21844/pajmes.v10i1.7794,"Ancient Philosophy, Quantum Reality and Management","The romanticism of management for numbers, metrics and deterministic models driven by mathematics, is

we propose an uncertainty principle of management and then list a set of factors which capture this

A comprehending to Ibn Khaldun’s Economic Philosophy and its outcomes for outstanding business performance assists entrepreneurs in managing intellectual capital (IC) purposefully. IC is deliberated as an indispensable factor in an organizational exertion to accentuate on bringing about competitive gains and augmenting value creations in knowledge-based economy. Instead of engaging merely on innovativeness of new products, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) entrepreneurs must also concentrate on administering IC in accordance to Ibn Khaldun’s Economic Philosophy. This paper targets to appreciate and re-examine contributions in Ibn Khaldun’s Economic Philosophy and IC in entrepreneurial researches and indicate how Ibn Khaldun’s Theory of Development is pertinent to research in the expanse of IC."

Através da análise comparativa entre as ideias de Conde de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier e Robert Owen, é possível notar que, para essa corrente de pensamento, a massa existe aqui ora como representante da forma social que os pobres devem estar para buscar sua emancipação social, ora como encarnação simbólica da cooperação, a verdadeira sabedoria social tal como é bem sintetizado pelo pensamento oweniano."

10.4102/sajpsychiatry.v13i3.16,Towards real persons: Clinical judgement and philosophy of psychiatry,"&lt;p&gt;One of the motivations for the new philosophy of psychiatry is the need to understand changing ideas in mental health care. In the last century, changes in both physical and biological theory prompted work in philosophy of physics and philosophy of biology to understand those fields better, attempts which were continuous with empirical work. At the start of this century, changes in psychiatry promise increased interest in the philosophy of psychiatry as an attempt, alongside empirical research, to understand the conceptual underpinnings of mental heath care. While philosophical methods are distinct from empirical methods, the work is truly interdisciplinary, growing organically from the complexities of demand on psychiatric care and, although philosophical, carried out by philosophers and psychiatrists alike. One focus is the nature of clinical judgement in psychiatric diagnosis. In this short note I will briefly sketch some issues that arise from a current idea: that psychiatric diagnosis should include idiographic elements.&lt;/p&gt;"

10.3926/jotse.258,Examining the impact of academic development in the engineering faculties in Chile: Changes in teaching philosophy and teachers' competencies,"The Faculties of Engineering Sciences at Universidad Católica del Norte in Chile regard teacher training as a necessary tool for its academics’ professional development and as a fundamental way to improve their teaching quality. The Teaching Unit for Innovation in Engineering (UIDIN) has developed a new curriculum and training programme which seeks to support the faculty in its implementation. This article presents some of the outcomes of a study aimed at qualitatively examining the development of the faculty’s conceptions and philosophy of teaching and improvements in pedagogical competencies as a result of the implementation and transfer of the training programme. The teaching philosophy is described in different ways, but overall it considers teaching an act of disciplinary knowledge transfer based on students’ interests, skills and attitudes, and with a heavy emphasis on building students’ core values. Interviews reveal changes in the participants’ learning and competencies due to the training, along with a positive impact on the teachers’ lesson planning and assessment strategies and students’ feedback and the willingness to engage in more reflexive teaching practice."

10.25180/lj.v18i2.49,The Influence of Herodotus on the Practical Philosophy of Aristotle,"The approach of this paper is a retrospective one. It is an attempt to show that many important ideas of Herodotus, a great ancestor of Aristotle, have influenced his practical philosophy. The paper focuses specially on several topics from the Histories of Herodotus, which have found a resonance in the Nicomachean ethics and in the Politics of Aristotle. The main ones in respect of the ethical theory are: the different forms of justice and the just as for example the super-human justice, the just in the family relations, the judicial just and the just in the polis or the larger human community. Book Epsilon of the Nicomachean Ethics is indebted to Herodotus in several points. In respect of Aristotles' political theory, there are two topics in the History of Herodotus which deserve a special interest: firstly, the conversation of the three noble Persians, who discuss the six basic types of political order and organization of power-and-submission in a state or city-state (in book ІІІ, 80-82); this becomes a paradigm for the next typologies of Plato (in the Republic and the Statesman) and Aristotle (in the Politics); secondly, the importance of personal freedom, the equity of the speaking (discussing?) men on the agora, and the supremacy of law for the well-being of any community and its peaceful future. The legacy of Herodotus is obvious in many anthropological and ethical concepts of Aristotle, especially in his most read and quoted ethical writing and in his Politics."
10.25180/lj.v18i2.54,The Genesis of Secular Politics in Medieval Philosophy: The King of Averroes and the Emperor of Dante,"In contemporary political discourse, the ""clash of civilizations"" rhetoric often undergirds philosophical analyses of ""democracy"" both at home and abroad. This is nowhere better articulated than in Jacques Derrida's Rogues, in which he describes Islam as the only religious or theocratic culture that would ""inspire and declare any resistance to democracy"" (Derrida 2005, 29). Curiously, Derrida attributes the failings of democracy in Islam to the lack of reference to Aristotle's Politics in the writings of the medieval Muslim philosophers. This paper aims to analyze this gross misconception of Islamic philosophy and illuminate the thoroughgoing influence the Muslim philosophers had on their Christian successors, those who are so often credited as foundations of Western political philosophy. In so doing, I compare the ideal states presented by Averroes and Dante – in which Aristotelian influence is intimately interlaced – and offer an analysis thereof as heralds of what we might call the secularization of the political, inspiring those democratic values that Derrida believes to be absent in the rich philosophy of the Middle Ages.   "

SOME REFLECTIONS ON SETTING PRIORITIES,"Philosophers and others with inquisitive minds have busied their brains for millennia with questions such as: ‘Does god exist? What is the meaning of life? Are we free or determined? What is truth? Is there any knowledge which is so certain that no reasonable person could doubt it? What is reality? What is good? What is beautiful? Why exist? What is “to be”? What is justice? What did Kant mean by the categorical imperative?’ Are all these topics equally (un)important or is there a ranking of philosophical problems?

This ideology wants everything to be rational and certainty, including legal issues must be no certainty. The purpose of this matter is to protect the rights of individuals. While the Indonesian society is a society that does not highlight the rights of individuals, but respects the balance between individual rights and collective rights. Thus, our criminal law enforcement is still sourced from Indonesian Penal Code which is a replica of the Wetboek Van Strafrech (WVS) created by the Dutch colonialists Government will not materialize justice. It is necessary to face these issues with two steps as the following i.e, &lt;em&gt;first one&lt;/em&gt;: the law enforcement agencies in using the law needs a more progressive interpretation, therefore a sense of justice can be realized. Second one, it needs to be realized in accordance with the criminal law reform ideology of kinship based on the values of Pancasila as an ideology of the Indonesia. Such measures are expected to materialize justice in the criminal law enforcement of Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; Criminal Law, Law Enforcement, Justice.&lt;/p&gt;"
10.1515/znth-2015-0002,The State as “a Consequence of the Curse of Humanity”: The Late Schelling’s Philosophy of Religion and of the State,"AbstractThis paper analyzes the hitherto neglected political philosophy (Staatsphilosophie) contained in Schelling’s Berlin lectures on the philosophy of mythology and of revelation in the context of the complex and politically charged debates of the German Vormärz period. It will be shown that, in his political philosophy, the Berlin Schelling rejects social contract models of the state and follows conservative theorists who conceive of the state as a collective order that supersedes the individual, while at the same time preserving the freedom of the individual and rejecting religious legitimizations of the state. Schelling’s theory of the state is characterized by its distinctive internal tensions and by its multidimensionality. This complexity of his theory of the state helps to account for the diverse range of receptions and assessments of his political philosophy, both among his contemporaries and by subsequent commentators"

Barth utilizes the unseasonable thoughts of Burckhardt and Nietzsche to critique the optimistic philosophy of history based in Berlin. Burckhardt’s suspicion of power is especially important for Barth as they both disagree with Nietzsche’s fascination with power and Hegel’s optimistic historical reason. However, Barth’s mature ideas about history are almost exclusively focused on God’s revelation in Christ, distancing himself from Burckhardt’s overtly pessimistic reading of history. The paper closes asking if Barth ever successfully navigates away from Hegelian historical reason"
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.2,Hegel’s First System Program and the Task of Philosophy,"Until 1800, Hegel held that religion takes primacy over philosophy. That commitment alters fundamentally with his first publications in Jena. The Difference essay (1801) and Faith and Knowledge (1802) hold the key to the genesis of his mature thought. Chapter 1 focuses on Hegel’s efforts to define the task of philosophy and thereby to shore up his new position. Hegel’s first system program, dedicated to a holistic conception of reality, is shaped by his understanding of three central concepts: the absolute, speculation, and the system. Here the influence of Jacobi and Spinoza is formative. Critical analysis of his reception of their thought illuminates the epistemological problems Hegel was still facing in Jena and reveals the abiding convictions that will henceforth guide him. The system program of the Difference essay thus both sets the agenda and forms the template for the famous Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.22,Hegel’s Philosophy of Action,"Though Hegel has a strikingly pluralistic philosophy of action, he intends that philosophy to make good on a range of traditional commitments running from the necessity of alternate possibilities through the value of desire satisfaction to the centrality of goal-directedness. It is of course true that many of those possibilities, desires, and goals are essentially social and even collective, and that determining their nature is a public and often retrospective interpretive act. But that determination must also take its cue from the interpretive direction proposed with the act by the agent herself, and the notion of absolute modality is Hegel’s way of seeing that cue as consisting in the suggestion of a context of interpretation by way of marking out the contrast of the action with a certain range of other possible actions."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.23,Hegel’s Moral Philosophy,"Hegel’s criticism of morality, or Moralität, has had a decisive influence in the reception of his thought. By general acknowledgment, while his writings support a broadly neo-Aristotelian ethics of self-actualization, his views on moral philosophy are exhausted by his criticisms of Kant, whom he treats as paradigmatic exponent of the standpoint of morality. The aim of this chapter is to correct this received view and show that Hegel offers a positive conception of moral willing. The main argument is presented in two parts: (a) an interpretation of the ‘Morality’ section of the Philosophy of Right that shows Hegel defending a guise of the good version of willing; and (b) an examination of problems raised by this view of willing, some of which are anticipated by Hegel in in his treatment of the ‘Idea of the Good’ in the Logic, and of the interpretative options available to deal with these problems."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.21,Hegel’s Philosophy of Law,"Hegel was neither a lawyer nor primarily a legal theorist, but his writings make a significant influence to the understanding of legal philosophy. Nevertheless, there is disagreement about where Hegel’s importance lies. This chapter argues that Hegel’s philosophy of law is best understood as a natural law theory. But what is interesting about Hegel’s view is that it represents a distinctive alternative to how most natural law theories are traditionally conceived. Hegel’s philosophy is remarkable for providing an entirely new way of thinking about the relation between law and morality than had been considered before. It is the distinctiveness of his legal philosophy that has rendered so difficult a categorization into standard jurisprudential schools of thought. There is little that is standard in Hegel’s innovative understanding of law. This has importance for other areas of his thinking, such as his novel theory of punishment and understanding of the common law."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.18,Hegel’s Philosophy of Nature,"Hegel’s Philosophy of Nature is best understood through its contribution to Hegel’s larger philosophical project of both articulating and actually achieving human freedom. It contributes to this project by showing that nature and natural things are themselves free, in a specific sense of freedom that Hegel critically appropriates from Kant. Hegel demonstrates this freedom of nature through the conceptual transformation of natural-scientific “representations” (laws, kinds, and other universals) into systematically ordered “concrete universals” in which the empirical content of the sciences is preserved and systematized in a way that emphasizes nature’s self-determination, rather than its alleged sheer givenness and “externality.” After a general account of, first, Hegel’s understanding of the natural sciences and their results, and, second, his transformative method, the chapter presents a detailed reconstruction of his treatment of collision, fall, and orbital motion in the Mechanics."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.25,Hegel’s Philosophy of History as the Metaphysics of Agency,"Rather than understanding history as a process guided by an entity (Geist) that is aiming at the goal of coming to a full self-consciousness, this chapter argues that Hegel’s philosophy should be understood against the background of his Aristotelian- and Kantian-inspired metaphysics. Using his Logic as the background, the author argues that his philosophy of history is an examination of the metaphysical contours of subjectivity and how the self-interpreting, self-developing collective human enterprise has moved from one such shape to another in terms of deeper logic of sense-making, and how this has meant that subjectivity itself has reshaped itself over the course of history. The role of the “infinite end” of justice thereby is shown to play an essential role in making sense of history."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.35,Hegel’s Revival in Analytic Philosophy,"Analytic philosophy is rediscovering Hegel. This chapter examines a particularly strong thread of new analytic Hegelianism, sometimes called ‘Pittsburgh Hegelianism’, which began with the work of Wilfrid Sellars. In trying to bring Anglo-American philosophy from its empiricist phase into a more sophisticated, corrected Kantianism, Sellars moved in substantially Hegelian directions. Sellars’s work has been extended and revised by his Pittsburgh colleagues John McDowell and Robert B. Brandom. The sociality and historicity of reason, the proper treatment of space and time, conceptual holism, inferentialism, the reality of conceptual structure, the structure of experience, and the nature of normativity are the central concerns of Pittsburgh Hegelianism."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.33,Hegel and Twentieth-Century French Philosophy,"This chapter looks at Hegel’s impact on twentieth-century French philosophy by focusing on Kojève’s influential interpretation of Hegel, which enabled Beauvoir and Fanon to adapt Hegel’s philosophy to theorize gender and racial inequalities. Kojève took the struggle for recognition and the master/slave dialectic to be the central elements of Hegel’s thought. On this basis, Beauvoir and Fanon came to understand gender and racial oppression in terms of distortions in human relations of recognition. They argue that women (for Beauvoir) and black people (for Fanon) have been excluded from full participation in the struggle for recognition. However, these existential-Hegelian views are sometimes thought to have been superseded by the anti-Hegelianism of post-1960s French post-structuralism. Against this position, the chapter explains how the post-structuralist ‘French feminist’ Irigaray takes up and transforms Hegel’s notion of mutual recognition, to recommend that differently sexed individuals accept and recognize one another in their irreducible difference."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.29,Hegel’s Lectures on the History of Modern Philosophy,"This chapter examines Hegel’s lectures on the history of modern philosophy in view of the tension between, on the one hand, his ambition to grasp philosophy’s past in a truly philosophical way and, on the other hand, the necessity to account for the actual particularities of a wide range of philosophical systems. Hegel’s lectures are put in relief by comparing their methodological principles to those put forward by his Kantian predecessor Tennemann. After discussing Hegel’s conception of modern philosophy as a whole, the chapter turns to his reading of Locke, Leibniz, and, in particular, Kant. In this context, it also compares Hegel’s assessment of Kant’s achievements to that of Tennemann. The chapter concludes by considering Hegel’s account of the final moment of the history of philosophy."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.27,"Feeling, Representation, and Practice in Hegel’s Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion","This chapter examines one of the most contested elements of Hegel’s corpus, his mature treatment of religion in his Berlin Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion. Emphasizing the need to approach the lectures in context, this chapter first situates Hegel’s philosophy of religion within his larger philosophical project. Doing so both illuminates why the material’s significance has been so debated and highlights what should and should not be assumed at the outset of the lectures. Paying careful attention to Hegel’s structuring of the project, the chapter works through his treatments of the concept of religion, cognition of the absolute, religious practice, the history of religions, and Christianity. The analysis of part two of the lectures, Determinate Religion, closely examines Hegel’s conception of the manifestation of religion. The treatment of the Christian cultus, or community, stresses the connection Hegel develops (by 1827) between this community and modern social and political life."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.26,Hegel’s Philosophy of Art,"Despite Hegel’s effusive praise for art as one of the ways humans express truth, art by his description is both essentially limited and at perpetual risk of ending. This hybrid assessment is apparent first in Hegel’s account of art’s development, which shows art culminating in classical sculpture’s perfect unity, but then, unable to depict Christianity’s interiority, evolving into religion, surrendering to division, or dissipating into prose. It is also evident in his ranking of artistic genres from architecture to poetry according to their ability to help humans produce themselves both individually and collectively: the more adequately art depicts human self-understanding, the more it risks ceasing to be art. Nevertheless, art’s myriad endings do not exhaust its potential. Art that makes humans alive to the unity and interdependence at the heart of reality continues to express the Idea and so achieves Hegel’s ambitions for its role in human life."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.3,Hegel’s Jena Practical Philosophy,"This chapter examines the development of Hegel’s Jena social and political philosophy prior to the publication of the Phenomenology, with a focus on Hegel’s engagement with Fichte. Hegel’s culminating project in his Jena practical philosophy involves synthesizing two social ideals: classical Greek communitarianism and modern liberal individualism. According to Hegel’s conception, the classical communitarian ideal threatens a form of nihilism: the destruction of free, independent subjectivity. The modern individualist ideal, by contrast, threatens atomism: the breakdown of community attachments in favor of the pursuit of private interests. Hegel’s Jena project is to avoid nihilism and atomism by synthesizing the two ideals into one coherent picture of ethical life. Two related conceptual innovations prove crucial to this project: first, the idea that human agency is formed through a struggle for recognition; and second, the idea that modern ethical life is a shape of objective spirit."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.28,Hegel’s Lectures on the History of Ancient and Medieval Philosophy,"As becomes apparent from his cursory treatment of the earlier philosophical systems of the East, Hegel’s account of the history of philosophy is decidedly Eurocentric, and this in turn reflects an important feature of his conception of the nature of philosophy itself. While abstraction plays a crucial role in its method, philosophy is not ultimately about the abstractions belonging to some purported platonic realm: it is about the actual, concrete world. Thus the invention of philosophy reflected a peculiarity of the outlook of its Greek inventors: their Heimatilichkeit, their distinct sense of feeling at home in the world. The Greeks, he claimed, did not employ abstract thought in an attempt to escape into a realm of abstractions. Rather, they employed systematic thought as part of the process of creating their own way of life in their world, thus linking the development of philosophy to the development of democratic institutions."

It is always full of allegory and literary divagations which intersperse a smooth flow of argumentation. This paper is written by Marklen Konurbaev, Professor of Literature at Moscow State University and his son Salavat, a student of Arabic Philosophy. The paper consists of four parts and attempts to reveal the hidden message of a famous extract from the renowned book Ihya Ulum Al Din by a Persian philosopher Ghazall, Abu Hamid Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Al-TusI, devoted to the analysis of the notion of &amp;#34;fairness&amp;#34; in the doings of a ruler. The hermeneutic analysis was performed based on the methodology propounded by Roland Gerard Barthes — a French literary theorist, philosopher, linguist and critic. This is the first ever attempt to put together the methodological efforts of a Western scholar and profoundly oriental piece of philosophy. Results of the hermeneutic study are stunning and elucidating. The paper could be recommended to the students of literature and philosophy at universities and colleges."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199759996.013.0034,Phenomenal Violence and the Philosophy of Religion,"This chapter offers the example of a philosophy that began with Jacques Derrida, the genesis and structure of whose overall thinking, writing, and interpretative praxis it reviews. Derrida, who has played an influential role as a groundbreaking thinker, speaks of an unconditional affirmation, an absolute performative, whose contours are not established. The neologism mondialatinisation captures the old-new and new-old taken as a total social phenomenon and one that is “at the same time hegemonic and finite, ultra-powerful and in the process of exhausting itself.” Derrida determines that if religion was ever dead and overcome, in its resurrected form it is much less localizable and predictable than ever before, most manifestly in the “cyberspatialized or cyberspaced wars of religion” or “war of religions.” Religion, the political religions, and religious wars and terrorisms in the contemporary world resist their very own demise or rumors thereof."

10.1017/s1369415415000011,Degrees of Responsibility in Kant’s Practical Philosophy,"AbstractIt has been argued that Kant’s practical philosophy cannot allow for degrees of responsibility for one’s actions. However, it would be uncompromising to allow for only two possibilities: either full responsibility or none. Moreover, in theMetaphysics of MoralsKant himself claims that there can be degrees of responsibility, depending on the magnitude of the obstacles that have to be overcome when acting. I will show that this claim is consistent with Kant’s theory as a whole and thereby make transparent how degrees of responsibility are possible for Kant. The solution is based on the distinction between two senses of responsibility: taking oneself to be anaccountableperson is an all-or-nothing affair, whereaspraise- or blameworthinessfor a particular action can still be a matter of degree."
10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190456320.003.0012,The Crucial Role of Culture in Japanese Environmental Philosophy,"A hybrid Japanese philosophy, integrating traditional Japanese Buddhist thought with the Western philosophical canon emerged during the twentieth century in response to the program of modernization instituted by the Maiji Restoration. Japanese culture, however, has been as important in shaping Japanese environmental ethics as have Japanese philosophical values. Japan has an extensive cultural heritage that has been built on mythology and folklore, and on religious beliefs and practices, and these ingredients have influenced the Japanese ethical consciousness. The indigenous Shinto religion, which evolved from animism, teaches that the ever-present kami (spirits) bind the Japanese to their environment. Their presence imparts a strong moral consciousness. Thus an understanding of the relationship of the kami to the Japanese people is essential for appreciating Japanese environmental ethics. Most Japanese have an intuitive belief in the kami that has been significant in forming their caring attitude toward the natural world."

The Ohashi River, which runs through Matsue City in the Izumo region and feeds the Hii River, has recently undergone extensive modification for flood control. This controversial project has been politically polarizing because of the tensions between human welfare, traditional cultural beliefs, sustainability, and environmental aesthetics. Changing the spatial structure of a community is both a cultural and a historical project that must take into account traditional beliefs about the relationship between human beings and the environment. The decision-making process for the development of social infrastructure should be grounded in meaningful citizen participation and should reflect the environmental values of the people."

In addition these reflections became increasingly concerned with what is distinctive about history as a form of knowledge, a form of knowledge which does not attract the attention of analytic philosophers. Historical knowledge is at once empirical and evidence-based but also, insofar as it concerns human affairs and institutions, obliged to make sense of and reconstruct the perspective of the practices and participants themselves. Part of the importance of historical understanding for Williams lies in its position as a model for humanistic knowledge that is non-reductionist while also being non-ideal, empirical, and “impure.”"

Dignity in this sense commands a “bowing” gesture, and is, it is argued, the subject of Du Bois’s neglected essay “Of Alexander Crummell.” More specifically, the chapter argues that Du Bois’s biographical tale of Crummell covertly offers an account of the genesis and nature of the virtues and qualities that constituted Crummell’s dignity. The chapter concludes that on Du Bois’s account, dignity is impossible without the sympathy of others; that it includes the conviction that one has a morally worthy purpose to pursue; that it is one’s duty to find that purpose and to pursue it; and that the virtues that constitute it follow from one’s unflagging struggles to fulfill those duties."

Problems are raised for interpretations of Buddhism as being committed to a theory of what makes an action morally right (specifically deontology, consequentialism, and virtue ethics). Following the lead of the poison arrow simile, a nontheoretical understanding of Buddhist moral thought is proposed: it was implicitly supposed that we do not need to act on the basis of universal moral principles but simply need to overcome the roots of unwholesome actions (greed, hatred, and delusion) and act skillfully. This interpretation is compared with other nontheoretical interpretations of Buddhist moral thought by reference to moral particularism, moral phenomenology, moral pluralism, and a nontheoretical conception of virtue ethics. It is also suggested that we should not be perplexed by the absence of explicit moral theory in Buddhism. Featured figures include Aristotle and Śāntideva."

10.1093/oso/9780198778165.003.0005,Method and System in Hegel’s Philosophy of Right,"This chapter argues that there is no substantive issue involved in the alleged controversy between “systematic” and “non-systematic” readers of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right. The source of the supposed issues is that accused of “non-systematic” readings are merely doing what any responsible historian of philosophy must do: they separate questions about what a historical philosopher thought from questions about how it may be appropriated today. The chapter then goes on to provide a positive account of the actual role played by Hegel’s system and method in his social theory, and describes Hegel’s systematic method and its application to the Philosophy of Right. It presents Hegel’s creative use of Fichte’s synthetic method, his rejection of the traditional conception of systematic philosophy in favor of conceptual pluralism, and the application of the Hegelian conceptions of method and system to the philosophical understanding of modern society."
10.1093/oso/9780198778165.003.0004,In What Sense is Hegel’s Philosophy of Right “Based” on His Science of Logic?,"Hegel famously says in the “Preface” to The Philosophy of Right that that outline or Grundriss presupposes “the speculative mode of cognition.” This is to be contrasted with what he calls “the old logic” and “the knowledge of the understanding” (Verstandeserkenntnis), a term he also uses to characterize all of metaphysics prior to his own. He makes explicit that he is referring to his book, The Science of Logic, but he does not explain the nature of this dependence anywhere in the book. This chapter attempts to explain the nature of this dependence, and to show that it is indeed crucial to understanding the argument of the work."
10.1093/oso/9780198778165.001.0001,Hegel's Political Philosophy,"Hegel famously argues that his speculative method is a foundation for claims about socio-political reality within a wider philosophical system. This systematic approach is thought a superior alternative to all other ways of philosophical thinking. Hegel’s method and system have normative significance for understanding everything from ethics to the state. Hegel’s approach has attracted much debate among scholars about key philosophical questions—and controversy about his proposed answers to them. Is his method and system open to the charge of dogmatism? Are his claims about the rationality of monarchy, unequal gender relations, an unelected second parliamentary chamber, and a corporation-based economy beyond revision? If not, does his political philosophy collapse into relativism? Since Hegel’s method is supposed to save him from either extreme, is there anything about his criticism of previous philosophies that could make his approach attractive to contemporary thinkers? Or is it preferable to focus on Hegel’s conclusions only, disregard his method, and interpret him in a non-systematic reading? This groundbreaking collection of new essays by leading interpreters of Hegel’s philosophy is dedicated to the questions that surround Hegel’s philosophical method and its relationship to the conclusions of his political philosophy. It contributes to the ongoing debate about the importance of a systematic context for political philosophy and the relationship between theoretical and practical philosophy, and it engages with contemporary discussions about the shape of a rational social order and gauges the timeliness of Hegel’s way of thinking."
10.1093/oso/9780198778165.003.0006,The Relevance of the Logical Method for Hegel’s Practical Philosophy,"This chapter examines the relevance of the “absolute method” developed in Hegel’s Science of Logic for his practical philosophy or philosophy of objective spirit. It argues, first, that the fruitfulness and vitality of Hegel’s practical philosophy as a whole depends in a fundamental way on two conditions, namely, (i) on its being conceived as part of a system of philosophy, and (ii) on its being based on the logic as the first part of the system. It argues, second, that the “absolute method” with which Hegel concludes the Logic presents the structure of a “logic of action.” It follows that since the Science of Logic itself is developed on the basis of the method, the logic is the foundational part of Hegel’s practical philosophy. Ultimately, the chapter contends that this is Hegel’s transformation and radicalization of Kant’s claim of the primacy of practical reason."
10.1093/oso/9780198778165.003.0002,"What Might it Mean to have a Systematic Idealist, but Anti-Platonist, Practical Philosophy?","While in broad agreement with Rorty’s emphasis on the role of redescription in Hegel’s method, and with his wish to free Hegel from the constraints of traditional metaphysics, this chapter argues against Rorty’s account of Hegel’s redescriptive methodology. His account is, it suggests, tied to a misleading Sartrean interpretation of Hegel’s famous “master–slave” dialectic—an interpretation that is in fact closer to Fichte’s use of the notion of recognition than Hegel’s own. When Hegel’s concept of recognition is understood in relation to the logic of his concept of the will, a more nuanced account of recognition is achieved. This is one that coheres with a “redescription” of the task of metaphysics that portrays it as an inquiry into a modally conceived actual world. Unlike Rorty’s redescription, this is one that preserves the relevance of the value of truth and not merely that of freedom for metaphysics."
10.1093/oso/9780198794394.001.0001,Religion in Liberal Political Philosophy,"In recent years, the notion of religion has received increased salience both in academic and in wider public debate, yet it is still a category that liberal political philosophers are uncomfortable with. This is somewhat paradoxical because key liberal notions (state sovereignty, toleration, individual freedom, the rights of conscience, public reason) were elaborated as a response to seventeenth-century European wars of religion, and the fundamental structure of liberalism is rooted in the Western experience of politico-religious conflict. So a reappraisal of this tradition—and of its validity in the light of contemporary challenges—is well overdue. This book offers the first extensive engagement with religion from liberal political philosophers. The volume analyses, from within the liberal philosophical tradition itself, the key notions of conscience, public reason, non-establishment, and neutrality. Insofar as the contemporary religious revival is seen as posing a challenge to liberalism, it seems more crucial than ever to explore the specific resources that the liberal tradition has to answer it."

An outline is provided of recent developments as a roadmap for the unfolding of this relationship. The question of whether China’s African interest can be seen as tacit colonisation is discussed. Even if these fears are allayed, the question remains whether the Chinese presence on the continent will make a significant difference to African development. To answer this question, the focus shifts to economic models and the Chinese recipe for economic progress. Confucianism was opposed during the cultural revolution of Mao Zedong, but it now forms the basis for Chinese foreign policy and internal affairs. This is briefly investigated. Some Confucian ideas are related to basic African concepts in an effort to find a common ground in Afro-Chinese relations. The impact of secular Confucianism on African spirituality is discussed."

Studies were carried out according to the method of application and descriptive data collection, in which data was collected by content analysis method. Data collection tools in the study are checklists of teaching philosophy to children program criteria, including four concepts (reasoning, conceptualization, judgment and wisdom) and sixteen sub-components. In this study, analysis basis was sentences, paragraphs and questions on the content of the studied book. Due to the limited size of the population, the ‘sample population’ was selected. The descriptive analysis methods (frequency, percentage and mean tables) were used for analyzing the findings. The results showed that the authors have paid more attention to some components of teaching philosophy to children, such as links between concepts, reality representation, cognition, inductive and deductive methods, application of criteria, difference, similarity, and decentralization and less attention to some components such as benchmarking, consistent beliefs and behaviors, true-heartedness and good deeds, faith to good words and deeds, and knowing the truth."

The basic reason is that the problem is one of determining the real nature of conscious states, and philosophy lacks the tools to work this out. It is argued that anti-materialist arguments in philosophy tend to rely on modal intuitions which lack any support. It is then argued that pro-materialist arguments, such as those of Smart and of Papineau, are dubious because they either yield a conclusion that is too conditional on what other types of research might discover, or rely on premises that anyone who is not already a materialist can simply query. Even if these points are correct the main thesis remains fairly speculative, but at least some support for it is presented."

This paper�based on several decades of work on the systematization and comparative contextualization of Gavella�s theoretical ouvre�makes an attempt at demonstrating the operability of Gavella�s concepts in the context of some recent interdisciplinary insights into the performance phenomenon. Gavella�s theory can clearly distinguish concepts that we bracket today under the rubric of meaning, as opposed to use, i.e. language-reference, as opposed to speaker�s reference. Already in the 1930s, he applied the relation of semantics to pragmatics, as it would eventually be understood in speech act theory from Austin on, to the problems peculiar to theatre. The core of this paper deals with Gavella�s �speech situations�, and the dynamism of exchange in the relational space of culture."

In form a commentary on the versified Laws of Yājñavalkya, it presents sophisticated and multifaceted discussions of all the major topics dealing with Hindu religious and legal duties collectively called dharma. This chapter examines Vijñāneśvara’s approach to basic problems of legal philosophy such as the sources and types of law, legal interpretation and reasoning, legal and moral obligation, the role of the state, and legal pluralism. It concludes by considering the driving metaphor that underlies Vijñāneśvara’s legal philosophy: law is a ritual, both the act and the obligation."

The key to solving these puzzles, it is argued, rests with recognizing Hume’s fundamental irreligious aims and objectives, beginning with his first and greatest work, A Treatise of Human Nature. The irreligious interpretation not only reconfigures our understanding of the unity and structure of Hume’s thought, it also provides a radically different picture of the way in which Hume’s philosophy is rooted in its historical context. By altering our understanding of the fundamentals of Hume’s philosophy in this way, the irreligious interpretation also challenges the adequacy of the familiar and entrenched framework of “British Empiricism.”"
10.1017/hgl.2017.12,Community in Hegel’s Social Philosophy,"Abstract
            In the Philosophy of Right Hegel argues that modern life has produced an individualized freedom that conflicts with the communal forms of life constitutive of Greek ethical life. This individualized freedom is fundamentally unsatisfactory, but it is in modernity seemingly resolved into a more adequate form of social freedom in the family, aspects of civil society, and ultimately the state. This article examines whether Hegel’s state can function as a community and by so doing satisfy the need for a substantial ethical life that runs through Hegel’s social thought. The article also examines why Hegel does not provide a detailed analysis of community, as a distinct sphere between the private and the public political sphere in the Philosophy of Right, and why it is not a key platform of his social freedom."

This premise was stated by John Stuart Mill more than 170 years ago, and Mill's canon, the Method of Agreement, is used here as a basis to create the ""Common Cause"" (CC) research design. The CC design is particularly relevant when a set of multiple circumstances can be represented by alternative theories of change or competing explanations. We consider several potential applications of the design and elaborate its structure within the validity framework of Shadish, Cook, and Campbell. We discuss threats to validity controlled by the CC design (e.g., selection bias, the bane of applied researchers, is not relevant) and illustrate possible analytic strategies using simulated data. We explicitly compare the CC design to four quasi-experimental designs in terms of the validity threats that they eliminate. Design weaknesses are addressed and ways to enhance the design's inferential power discussed. The CC design itself represents a proof of concept suggesting that other research designs can be created from philosophical principles."

This effectively represented the application of the results of scientific knowledge to the population’s needs and to the production of the material components of life. Thus, the activities of independent and/or itinerant lecturers, with their courses and publications, helped to spread knowledge on the principles of mechanical and experimental science among the men who became protagonists of their country’s transformation into the first industrial power in the world. One among those lecturers was John Banks (1740–1805), who offered courses and specialized knowledge on mechanical physics and machinery to many manufacturers, engineers and mechanics, who stood at the forefront of England’s industrial transformation and was himself one of the main intellectual exponents of this process."

However, argumentation problems and the practical realization of requirements of the theory of argumentation were enormous part of Armenian philosophers’ works. They discussed argumentation problems mostly from object-language rather than meta-language prospective. This research focuses on the works of three mediaeval thinkers: Yeznik Koghbacy (IV-V), David Anhaght (The Invincible, V), Grigor Tatevatsi (XIV-XV). In their theoretical heritage the examination of argumentation issues and coverage can be regarded as the most significant stages of history of Armenian argumentation theories, the interpretation of which first of all aims to accomplish the following problems:&#x0D;
&#x0D;
Present the argumentation doctrines of each chosen philosopher as a complete idea of the theory of argumentation.&#x0D;
Complete the critical analysis of the theoretical heritage of the examinee philosophers.&#x0D;
Clarify the most important stages of history of Armenian argumentation doctrines.&#x0D;
Thereby increase the possibility of including history of Armenian argumentation theories in universal history.&#x0D;

The history of each theory can be perceived and properly appreciated from the perspective of that theory’s modern level of development. Considering that fact this research reconstructs the models of syntax and semantics of the language of argumentation."

10.24234/wisdom.v8i1.168, The Structure of Human Being in Postmodern Philosophy,"The originality of postmodernism consists in the negation of the intellectual achievements of previous eras and losing the continuity of the problems of human existence, thus, losing the search for its solution. So, it is forced to justify its postulates and methodology by the way of reflection. How can the individual in the case of the negation of philosophical ontology, epistemology and logic make more or less adequate reflection and comparative analysis? Last resort is found in philosophical methodology, which remained beyond criticism of adherents of postmodernism as their different sentences can be considered as a product of detailed methodological postulates. The methodology is veiled by the concept of ""discourse"", i.e. the characteristics of Postmodernism as a special spiritual attitude and ideological orientation, expressed in ""image I"" possessing certain connectedness and immersed in a socio-cultural, socio-psychological and other contexts. However, in the postmodernists is implicitly shown the methodological function of philosophy in the formation of the ""reflexive consciousness"" and ""social reflection"" as of the two fundamental determinants of human existence in the post-industrial society."
10.4102/satnt.v32i1.386,A theoretical reflection on the implications of the philosophy of technology for classroompedagogy,"Learning programmes for technology education and its facilitation at chalk leveloften lack a scientifically founded, subject-based, philosophical framework. Matters arecomplicated by the fact that technology at school level is globally a developing subject withno existing equivalent academic discipline which can serve as a source of curriculumdevelopment and classroom pedagogy to rely upon in practice. The purpose of the article wasto do an investigation into a philosophical framework of technology that can be directive toclassroom pedagogy. The following research questions served as a departure point for thetheoretical reflection that underpinned the article, namely, (1) which aspects of a scientificallyfounded philosophical framework of technology can be directive to classroom pedagogy and(2) what are the implications of a philosophical framework of technology for specific aspectsof classroom pedagogy, for example instructional approaches, learning outcomes and learningcontent? In answer to the first research question, it was found that a philosophical frameworkof technology, based on the four modes of the manifestation of technology – namely as object,knowledge, activity, and volition – can be directive to classroom pedagogy. The teacher’schoice of learning outcomes, broad instructional approaches, strategies and skills, as well as thetypes of conceptual and procedural knowledge that should be taught, is closely related to thephilosophical underpinning of technology as phenomenon. In answer to the second researchquestion, teachers’ knowledge and understanding of a philosophical framework of technologycan support the specific choices that they must make regarding the learning outcomes, broadinstructional approaches, strategies and skills, as well as the types of conceptual and proceduralknowledge that should be taught – and hence become directive to classroom practice."
10.1017/hgl.2013.2,"Hegel, Naturalism and the Philosophy of Nature","Abstract
            In this article I consider whether Hegel is a naturalist or an anti-naturalist with respect to his philosophy of nature. I adopt a cluster-based approach to naturalism, on which positions are more or less naturalistic depending how many strands of the cluster naturalism they exemplify. I focus on two strands: belief that philosophy is continuous with the empirical sciences, and disbelief in supernatural entities. I argue that Hegel regards philosophy of nature as distinct, but not wholly discontinuous, from empirical science and that he believes in the reality of formal and final causes insofar as he is a realist about universal forms that interconnect to comprise a self-organizing whole. Nonetheless, for Hegel, natural particulars never fully realize these universal forms, so that empirical inquiry into these particulars and their efficient-causal interactions is always necessary. In these two respects, I conclude, Hegel's position sits in the middle of the naturalism/anti-naturalism spectrum."
10.1017/s0263523200000458,Thom Brooks's Project of a Systematic Reading of Hegel's Philosophy of Right,"Thom Brooks'sHegel's Political Philosophy: A Systematic Reading of the Philosophy of Rightpresents a very clear and methodologically self-conscious series of discussions of key topics within Hegel's classic text. As one might expect for a ‘systematic’ reading, the main body of Brooks's text commences with an opening chapter on Hegel's system. Then follow seven chapters, the topics of which (property, punishment, morality, family, law, monarchy, war) are encountered sequentially as one reads through thePhilosophy of Right. Brooks's central claim is that too often Hegel's theories or views on any of these topics are misunderstood because of a tendency to isolate the relevant passages from the encompassing structure of thePhilosophy of Rightitself, and, in turn, from Hegel's system of philosophy as a whole, with its logical underpinnings. Brooks is clearly right in holding that Hegel hadintendedthePhilosophy of Rightto be read against the background of ‘the system’ and the ‘logic’ articulating it —nobody doubts that— but there is a further substantive issue here.Shouldcontemporary readers heed Hegel's advice? Brooks's answer is emphatically in the affirmative, and what results is a series of illuminating discussions in which he makes a case for his own interpretations on the basis of systematic considerations, presented against a range of alternatives taken from the contemporary secondary literature, which is amply covered, often in the extensive endnotes to the book."
10.1017/s0263523200000495,Democracy Out of Joint? The Financial Crisis in Light of Hegel's Philosophy of Right,"The financial crisis that currently besets Europe not only disturbs the life of many citizens, but also affects our economic, political and philosophical theories. Clearly, many of the contributing causes, such as the wide availability of cheap credit after the introduction of the euro, are contingent. Analyses that aim to move beyond such contingent factors tend to highlight the disruptive effects of the neoliberal conception of the market that has become increasingly dominant over the last few decades. Yet while the financial sector has received most of the blame, and rightly so, few commentators seem willing to take into account the role played by representative democracy in its current form. Even if it is granted that actual democratic policies fall short of what they ought to achieve, contemporary representative democracy itself is seldom regarded as part of the tangle it was supposed to resolve. David Merill touches upon this issue when he notes, in the preceding issue of thisBulletin, that ‘the economic dilemmas faced today may be ultimately the consequences of state failure’. The state that has failed to regulate the markets is described as ‘weak’ and ‘subject to external blows, blind to its ends, merely one actor among many in the events of the day’ (Merill 2012: 28). Yet Merill does not seem to consider this weakness to be an inherent feature of the constellation of which contemporary democracy is a part.There are, of course, excellent reasons not to take this path. First, representative democracy has in many cases proved to be the best way of preventing small elites from acquiring political power, and many of the impressive social and political achievements of the twentieth century are the result of democratic processes."
10.1017/s026352320000015x,"Kant's Cognitive Semantics, Newton's Rule Four of Philosophy and Scientific Realism","Kant'sCritique of Pure Reasoncontains an original and powerful semantics of singular cognitive reference which has important implications for epistemology and for philosophy of science. Here I argue that Kant's semantics directly and strongly supports Newton's Rule 4 of (natural) Philosophy in ways which support Newton's realism about gravitational force. I begin with Newton's Rule 4 of Philosophy and its role in Newton's justification of realism about gravitational force (§II). Next I briefly summarize Kant's semantics of singular cognitive reference (§III). I then show that the key point of Kant's cognitive semantics is embedded in and strongly supports Newton's Rule 4, and that it rules out not only Cartesian physics (perHarper) but also Cartesian, infallibilist presumptions about empirical justification generally (§IV). Finally, I argue that Kant's semantics reveals a key defect in the original version of Bas van Fraassen's anti-realist ‘Constructive Empiricism’, and in many common objections to realism (§V). Fortunately, Kant's semantics of singular cognitive reference stands independently of his Transcendental Idealism; nothing I argue in this paper depends at all upon that doctrine.In experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena by induction should be considered either exactly or very nearly true notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses, until yet other phenomena make such propositions either more exact or liable to exceptions. (Newton 1999: 796)"
10.1017/s0263523200000161,"Transformations of Transcendental Philosophy: Wolff, Kant, and Hegel","Kant's philosophy is generally known as transcendental philosophy or transcendental idealism, terms often thought to describe the inquiry into the subjective conditions of empirical knowledge carried out in theCritique of Pure Reason. On this conception of transcendental philosophy Kant is seen to pursue a project very different from both Wolffian metaphysics and Hegelian speculative science. This view is confirmed by scholars who compare Kant's conception of transcendental philosophy to the Scholastics' conception of ‘transcendentals’ such as unity, truth, and perfection. On their account, there remains a puzzling gap between, on the one hand, the scholastic conception of the most general determinations of all beings and, on the other hand, Kant's investigation into the conditions of possibility of experience.In this article I want to challenge this common view of Kant's transcendental philosophy for two reasons. The first reason concerns the question of how theCritique of Pure Reasonitself should be read. I take the view that in the firstCritiqueKant's primary aim is to determine the conditions of synthetic a priori knowledge rather than to identify the a priori conditions of empirical knowledge. Since metaphysics was traditionally considered to be the discipline that possessed a priori knowledge of things, this view makes good sense of Kant's presentation of theCritique of Pure Reasonas a work intended to transform metaphysics into a science. In this article I hope to clarify the nature of this transformation by determining the elements which Kant's transcendental philosophy has in common with Wolff's ontology, as well as the respects in which Kant turns against Wolff. I thus hope to solve some of the riddles posed by Kant's use of the term ‘transcendental philosophy’ in theCritique of Pure Reason."

On the one hand, he presents an account of scientific methodology which renders theories as mere instruments. On the other hand, he acknowledges that theories with particular theoretical virtues (e.g., unity, simplicity, novel predictions) offer a classification of experimental laws that “corresponds to real affinities among the things themselves.” In this paper, we argue that Duhem’s philosophy of science was motivated by an anti-sceptical tendency, according to which we can confidently assert that our theories reveal truths about nature while, at the same time, admitting that anti-scepticism should be moderated by epistemic humility. Understanding Duhem’s epistemological position, which was unique amongst French philosophers of science in the beginning of the 20th century, requires a careful examination of his accounts of representation, explanation, and of their interrelation."

This presence was very scarce, so we must speak of an absence. One can identify the causes of this absence with the fact that all the great Italian philosophical currents, in different ways, have had little interest or been manifestly opposed to the tensions that came from abroad after the great discussion about the crisis of mechanicism in which Duhem was an important protagonist."
10.1017/s0034670517000250,The Musical Philosophy of Bertrand de Jouvenel,"Abstract
            In this essay I set forth the musical philosophy of Bertrand de Jouvenel, a topic that has not been previously explored. I focus on Jouvenel's literary background; his emphasis on the imagination; his insistence that metaphor is the basis of all thought; and his critique of the “amousia” of modern philosophy, that is, its lack of music. Jouvenel believes that this amousia has led to dangerous political consequences in the twentieth century, such as the aesthetic and psychological promotion of violence. After setting forth Jouvenel's account, I explore these consequences."
10.1017/s1358246100005622,Philosophy and Religion in the Thought of Kierkegaard,"Kierkegaard is often regarded as a precursor of existential philosophy whose religious concerns may, for philosophical purposes, be safely ignored or, at best, regarded as an unfortunate, if unavoidable, consequence of his complicity with the very metaphysics he did so much to discredit. Kierkegaard himself, however, foresaw this appropriation of his work by philosophy. ‘The existing individual who forgets that he is an existing individual will become more and more absent-minded’, he wrote, ‘and as people sometimes embody the fruits of their leisure moments in books, so we may venture to expect as the fruits of his absent-mindedness the expected existential system—well, perhaps, not all of us, but only those who are as absent-minded as he is’ (Kierkegaard, 1968, p. 110). However, it may be rejoined here, this expectation merely shows Kierkegaard's historically unavoidable ignorance of the development of existential philosophy with its opposition to the idea of system and its emphasis upon the very existentiality of the human being. How could a form of thought which, in this way, puts at its centre the very Being of the existing individual, its existentiality, be accused of absent-mindedness? Has it not, rather, recollected that which metaphysics had forgotten? Yet the impression remains that Kierkegaard would not have been persuaded himself that such recollection could constitute remembering that one is an existing individual, for he remarks, of his own ignoring of the difference between Socrates and Plato in his Philosophical Fragments, ‘By holding Socrates down to the proposition that all knowledge is recollection, he becomes a speculative philosopher instead of an existential thinker, for whom existence is the essential thing. The recollection principle belongs to speculative philosophy, and recollection is immanence, and speculatively and eternally there is no paradox’ (Kierkegaard, 1968, p. 184n). We must ask, therefore, whether the recollection of existentiality can cure an existential absent-mindedness or remains itself a form of immanence for which there is no paradox."
10.1017/s1358246100005725,Philosophy vs. Mysticism: an Islamic Controversy,"Islamic philosophy makes a sharp distinction between different categories of believers. Some, and indeed most, believers follow Islam in an unquestioning and natural manner. They adhere to the legal requirements of the religion, carry out the basic rules concerning worship, pilgrimage, charity and so on, and generally behave as orthodox and devout Muslims. Some are more devout than others, and some occasionally behave in ways reprehensible to the teachings of Islam, but on the whole for the ordinary believer Islam presents no serious theoretical problems. There may well be practical problems in reconciling what they wish to do with what Islam instructs them to do, but this for most people is not something which leads them to question their faith as such. It merely leads them to wonder how to reconcile in a practical way the rival demands of religion and their personal wishes."
10.1017/s1473550417000192,Philosophy and data in astrobiology,"Abstract
            Creating a unified model of life in the universe – history, extent and future – requires both scientific and humanities research. One way that humanities can contribute is by investigating the relationship between philosophical commitments and data. Making those commitments transparent allows scientists to use the data more fully. Insights in four areas – history, ethics, religion and probability – demonstrate the value of careful, astrobiology-specific humanities research for improving how we talk and think about astrobiology as a whole. First, astrobiology has a long and influential history. Second, astrobiology does not decentre humanity, either physically or ethically. Third, astrobiology is broadly compatible with major world religions. Finally, claims about the probability of life arising or existing elsewhere rest heavily on philosophical priors. In all four cases, identifying philosophical commitments clarifies the ways in which data can tell us about life."
10.21555/top.v0i53.823,Emmanuel Levinas in the face of the rise of Nazism elementary philosophy: a methodological and political debate.,"In Reflections on the Philosophy of Hitlerism (1934) and in the face of the rise of Nazism in Europe, Levinas calls the European civilization, in particular, the Jewish, Christian, Liberal and Marxist traditions, to confront the emergence of the elementary philosophy of Hitlerism. In this short article, the philosopher urges those traditions to trace their identities back to their sources, intuitions and original decisions, in particular, to the ""spirit of freedom"" that animates them and to their conceptions of human destiny (Levinas, 1990, p. 64).However, in contemporary reception on Levinas’ reflections there’s a methodological and political discussion about how to interpret this appeal to a common ""spirit"" or ""feeling"" shared by European traditions, as well as about the meaning that acquires the elementary and threatening counterpart that is Hitlerism. This paper aims to inquire into some aspects of this methodological and political debate aroused by interwar writings of Levinas."
10.1017/s0034412515000293,The modality of theism and probabilistic natural theology: a tension in Alvin Plantinga's philosophy,"AbstractIn Wunder (2013) I observed a probabilistic blunder in Plantinga (2011) and argued that correcting it, while noting Plantinga's acceptance of logically non-contingent theism, had negative consequences for many other of his probabilistic claims. Professor Plantinga kindly replied to my correspondence, but the fruits of that conversation could not be incorporated into Wunder (2013). This article will explain the blunder and summarize my earlier arguments before addressing Plantinga's main replies. I conclude that these replies fail to circumvent most of the problems observed earlier: perhaps most significantly, the Evolutionary Argument against Naturalism and theism's logical non-contingency still appear jointly to imply theism's necessary falsehood."
10.1017/s0034412515000347,Whither philosophy of religion?,"The post-war expansion of university faculties climaxed in the early 1970s. Since then, there have been more professional philosophers than ever before in history: a startling claim, but sober truth. In analytic philosophy, they have worked with more rigour and better training than even the Scholastics. It would take a surprising lack of talent among us, or perhaps argue some deep defect in the questions we ask, if the result werenotmore progress in philosophy than most periods can boast. And in fact, those who know what progress in philosophy looks like can see a lot of it: just compare Malcolm's 1960 piece on the ontological argument with Plantinga's 1974 treatment inThe Nature of Necessity, and then both with Oppy's book on the subject."

According to Jonathan Schaffer, they had misunderstood monism more generally. A key thread of the creation narrative of analytic philosophy, according to which Russell and Moore successfully undermined monism to give rise to a new movement is, therefore, in doubt.

10.26417/ejis.v3i1.p107-110,Miskawayh’s Apologia for Greek Philosophy,"In the East, Greek philosophy was studied as early as the fourth century, not however, by the Muslims but by the Arab Syrian Christians. It was Syrian Christians who brought wine, silk and other precious items to the West, but it was the Syrians also who cultivated Greek sciences for many centuries before they eventually transmitted them to the Muslim philosophers, especially in the tenth and eleventh century Baghdad. Miskawayh (d.1030), a great Muslim moralist, was among the philosophers who flourished in Baghdad at such times. He was well educated in Islamic studies as well as in philosophy, especially Greek philosophy. The many quotations from Greek sources which are found in Miskawayh’s works, especially in his major work on ethics, Tahdhib al-Akhlaq (The Refinement of Character), provide important evidence for this study to argue that they also have contributed to the formation of his moral philosophy. This paper thus, seeks to investigate Miskawayh’s own attraction to Greek ideas, which eventually led him towards the acceptance of Greek thought and also towards the need for an apologetic on behalf of philosophical study and on the relations between philosophy and the divine revelation."
10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190274870.003.0004,A Trinitarian Natural Philosophy,"This chapter sets forth the theological motivations and basic contours of Baxter’s theory of nature. In contrast with early modern trends toward separation of the domains of theology and philosophy, Baxter sympathized with a tradition of Mosaic physics popular among early modern Calvinists. Baxter also identified with a medieval tradition of identifying traces of the Trinity (vestigia Trinitatis) in nature. These motivations informed an eclectic reception of the philosophies of Tommaso Campanella and Robert Boyle. Baxter divided reality into passive and active natures, and accommodated Boyle’s corpuscular philosophy in the passive inorganic realm while maintaining Aristotelian and scholastic concepts regarding the soul. His view of active natures and souls was informed by a tradition of reflection on vestigia Trinitatis and the philosophy of Campanella."
10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190274870.003.0003,Reason and Philosophy,"This chapter discusses Baxter’s approach to the nature of reason and its relation to the will, the noetic effects of sin, the relation between reason and revelation, and the use of philosophy. Baxter drew eclectically on the views of Duns Scotus on the will and Thomas Aquinas on the relation of reason and revelation. His understanding of the faculty of reason gave priority to sense perception, was generally unsympathetic to Cartesian skepticism of the senses, and contrasted with Herbert of Cherbury’s theory of common notions. His approach to philosophy was cautious and eclectic, gave greater preference to Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy over Epicurean and mechanical philosophy, and recognized the need for philosophical reform."
10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190274870.003.0002,Baxter and the Rise of Mechanical Philosophy,"This chapter sets Baxter’s involvement with mechanical philosophy against the backdrop of the growth of mechanical philosophy, with particular attention to the growing interest in Epicurean ideas and the work of Pierre Gassendi. Baxter’s engagement with mechanical philosophy is traced in chronological sequence from the 1650s until his death in 1691. In the course of this narrative, Baxter’s personal relationships to Joseph Glanvill, Robert Boyle, Matthew Hale, and Henry More are surveyed. The context of Baxter’s manuscript and published works relating to mechanical philosophy are also discussed. Matthew Hale appears as a significant figure in the development of Baxter’s philosophical thought, as well as the production of his published works and the suppression from publication of an important manuscript on the nature and immortality of the soul."
10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190274870.003.0006,The Incipient Materialism of Mechanical Philosophy,"Drawing on previously unexamined manuscript evidence, this chapter addresses Baxter’s response to two issues concerning the soul. First, the application of mechanical philosophy to proofs for the immortality of the soul resulted in a modification of the argument from the soul’s immateriality, with a new contrast between mechanical bodies and incorporeal substance. Baxter preferred an alternative mode of argumentation, and regarded proofs put forward by Henry More and Pierre Gassendi as either weak or a temptation to materialism. Second, Thomas Willis’s De anima brutorum (1672) made use of Gassendi’s theory of a material soul, which provoked a reply from Baxter. In a neglected manuscript, Baxter set forth various objections to chapters from Willis’s book, and contented that that Willis’s theory could be logically extended into an argument for the complete materialism of the human soul."
10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190608040.001.0001,The Problem of Universals in Early Modern Philosophy,"The ancient topic of universals was central to scholastic philosophy, which raised the question of whether universals exist as Platonic forms, as instantiated Aristotelian forms, as concepts abstracted from singular things, or as words that have universal signification. It might be thought that this question lost its importance after the decline of scholasticism in the modern period. However, the fourteen contributions to this volume indicate that the issue of universals retained its vitality in modern philosophy. Modern philosophers in fact were interested in three sets of issues concerning universals: (1) issues concerning the ontological status of universals, (2) issues concerning the psychology of the formation of universal concepts or terms, and (3) issues concerning the value and use of universal concepts or terms in the acquisition of knowledge. Chapters in this volume consider the various forms of “Platonism,” “conceptualism,” and “nominalism” (and distinctive combinations thereof) that emerged from the consideration of such issues in the work of modern philosophers. The volume covers not only the canonical modern figures, namely, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant, but also more neglected figures such as Pierre Gassendi, Pierre-Sylvain Regis, Nicolas Malebranche, Henry More, Ralph Cudworth, and John Norris."
10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190608040.003.0001,Introduction to Universals in Modern Philosophy,"The different problems related to the topic of universals were central to the philosophical agenda from antiquity and especially during the medieval era, but they lost this centrality and seemed virtually to disappear during the early modern period. During this period, for instance, there was widespread hostility toward the essentialist hylomorphic framework in terms of which the issue of universals had been debated in the scholastic literature. Nonetheless, what occurred in the early modern period was more a transformation than a disappearance of this issue. This chapter introduces the history of the concept of universals and outlines the contents of the chapters in this volume."
10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190608040.003.0007,Universals and Individuals in Malebranche’s Philosophy,"In Malebranche’s work, universals are identified with God’s ideas, which are the same ideas by means of which human beings know the world. However, because Malebranche states, at least in his mature writings, that all ideas are universal, general, and infinite, the knowledge of particulars appears problematic. This chapter addresses this question by showing that a consideration of the medieval sources of Malebranche’s theory of knowledge—the vision in God—allows for not only a better understanding of the problem but also its solution. In fact, as with Aquinas’s God, whose definition of divine ideas is here recalled, Malebranche’s God gives rise to individual ideas by looking at His essence. In this sense, Malebranche seems to propose a theory of knowledge of individuals both for human beings—as Martial Gueroult has already suggested—and for God."

In the first part of the chapter, some of the issues in the philosophy of mind which are addressed in Kant’s Critical writings are summarised.

Papers in the first part look at equality and justice: Keith Hyams examines the contribution of ex ante equality to ex post fairness; Elizabeth Anderson looks at equality from a political economy perspective; Serena Olsaretti’s paper studies liberal equality and the moral status of parent–child relationships; and George Sher investigates doing justice to desert. In the second part, papers address questions of state legitimacy: Ralf Bader explores counterfactual justifications of the state; David Enoch examines political philosophy and epistemology; and Seth Lazar and Laura Valentini look at proxy battles in just war theory. The final three papers cover social issues that are not easily understood in terms of personal morality, yet which need not centrally involve the state: the moral neglect of negligence (Seana Valentine Shiffrin), the case for collective pensions (Michael Otsuka); and authority and harm (Jonathan Parry)."
10.1093/oso/9780198801221.003.0007,Political Philosophy and Epistemology,"Public reason theorists in political philosophy—roughly, Rawlsians—often make what sure sound like epistemological statements. They talk about justifying principles to others, about the uncertainty with which we should hold our evaluative commitments, about reasonable persons and comprehensive doctrines, about a morally politically motivated higher epistemic standard, about intellectual modesty, and, of course, about the burdens of judgment. But they rarely explain, let alone defend, these seemingly epistemological commitments, nor do they engage contemporary epistemological literature. This paper exposes these commitments to epistemological scrutiny, arguing that at the end of the day they cannot be vindicated. It focuses on what, on such theories, a reasonable person who is nevertheless committed to a comprehensive doctrine believes, and on what epistemic standard may be politically relevant in this context."
10.1017/s0007087415000588,"Bears in Eden, or, this is not the garden you're looking for: Margaret Cavendish, Robert Hooke and the limits of natural philosophy","AbstractThis paper investigates Margaret Cavendish's characterization of experimental philosophers as hybrids of bears and men in her 1666 storyThe Description of a New World, Called the Blazing World. By associating experimental philosophers, in particular Robert Hooke and his microscope, with animals familiar to her readers from the sport of bear-baiting, Cavendish constructed an identity for the fellows of the Royal Society of London quite unlike that which they imagined for themselves. Recent scholarship has illustrated well how Cavendish's opposition to experimental philosophy is linked to her different natural-philosophical, political and anthropological ideas. My contribution to this literature is to examine the meanings both of bears in early modern England and of microscopes in experimental rhetoric, in order to illustrate the connection that Cavendish implies between the two. She parodied Hooke's idea that his microscope extended his limited human senses, and mocked his aim that by so doing he could produce useful knowledge. The bear-men reflect inhuman ambition and provide a caution against ignoring both the order of English society and the place of humans in nature."

In each group there were sixteen participants. The researchers used independent samples t-test and paired samples t-test to analyze the collected data. The data analysis using paired samples t-test showed that both methods of instruction have a significant effect on learners’ WTC. However, the learners’ WTC increased more in Debate group comparing to the Philosophy Inquiry classroom discussion group. The results indicate that Debate is more effective than Philosophy Inquiry classroom discussion in enhancing ESL learners’ WTC."

In this context, the main purpose of this study is to present an analytical research in terms of the obstacles and difficulties faced by Brazilian companies to implement the Lean Manufacturing. Through a literature review of the annals of ENEGEP (the Brazilian Production Engineering Conference), this research concluded that the main obstacles and difficulties of such implementation fall under seven lines: 1) difficulties using the tool; 2) operational resistance; 3) cultural differences; 4) slow response to market; 5) lack of top/senior management involvement; 6) lack of middle management support, 7) lack of resources to invest. This article stands as a useful source for further studies about the Lean Manufacturing system."
10.4102/satnt.v32i1.387,A theoretical reflection on the implications of the philosophy of technology for teacher education.,"Since the implementation of technology as relatively new school subject, challenges are constantly being posed to higher education institutions (HEIs), and in particular those engaged in teacher training and the professional development of technology teachers. Teacher training programmes had to be developed and implemented within a limited time frame in comparison to other school subjects, despite a lack of previous experience of an appropriate academic discipline, subject methodology and classroom pedagogy. Furthermore, implications on organisational and managerial level regarding its accommodation within existing structures of faculties, schools and departments at HEIs had to be accounted for. The purpose of the article was to investigate how a scientifically founded philosophical framework of technology might guide teacher training at HEIs. The following research questions served as point of departure: in which way can a scientifically founded philosophical framework of technology be indicative regarding a relevant: (1) Subject methodology of technology? (2) Underlying academic discipline for undergraduate technology education students? In answer to the first question, it was found that it is important for programme developers, coordinators and subject methodology lecturers at HEIs to acquaint themselves sufficiently with a philosophical framework for technology to direct the technology teacher’s training and professional development. It seems viable to keep subject methodology of technology autonomous, with only one lecturer responsible, and that technology education students should be conversant in the philosophical framework for technology. In answer to the second question HEIs should urgently determine the nature and composition of the relevant academic disciplines underpinning the undergraduate qualification of a specialised technology teacher. Mechanisms should also be created to forge a relationship between the academic discipline and the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) of technology education students. "
10.1017/s0017383515000182,Philosophy,"I start this review, which focuses for the most part on publications on Hellenistic philosophy, with a survey of some recent studies on Stoicism. René Brouwer'sThe Stoic Sageintroduces itself as ‘an attempt to bring the early Stoic notions of the sage and wisdom to the fore again’ (1). ‘Again’ alludes to the fact that those notions, which attracted considerable philosophical and scholarly interest at various stages since antiquity, have not received sufficient attention in recent times (specialists in the area will judge the merits of this assessment). The book is divided into four chapters, dealing respectively with the Stoic definitions of wisdom; the ancient puzzles surrounding the nature and very possibility of the change from ‘folly’ to ‘wisdom’; the controversial question of whether the Stoics themselves believed they had achieved the ideal of perfect wisdom; and the intellectual, Socratic background against which the Stoics developed their notion of wisdom. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 contain, in expanded and revised form, material published by Brouwer in self-contained essays between 2002 and 2008. Chapter 1, with its analysis of the Stoic definitions of wisdom as ‘knowledge of human and divine matters’ and ‘fitting expertise’, is fundamental to set the stage for the more focused inquiries of the rest of the book. From this point of view, it succeeds only partially. It helpfully covers a reasonable amount of ground, but because of Brouwer's choice to focus exclusively on the Stoicdefinitionsof wisdom (sophia) at this stage, and not, say, on the descriptions of the Stoic wise man (sophos: Brouwer's preferred translation ‘sage’ hides the etymological connection), it also problematically leaves some fundamental aspects untouched. I was especially surprised not to see the key notion of infallibility discussed at all in this context, despite the fact that Brouwer correctly clarifies that Stoic wisdom is not to be interpreted as a form of omniscience (33–4). This ultimately springs from an insufficiently detailed analysis of the Stoics’ notions ofkatalēpsis(which Brouwer translates as ‘cognition’, without ever explaining its distinctive status), and then, in turn, ofepistēmēandtechnē, and their Stoic definitions (see also the puzzling reference to ‘weak cognitions’ on p. 62). (I only note here that Paolo Togni's 2010 monographConoscenza e virtù nella dialettica stoicaexamines much more extensively and systematically the psychological and epistemological ground which needs to be covered by a discussion of Stoicsophia.) The attempt to map exhaustively the three key terms of the first definition – knowledge, human and divine – into the three parts of Stoic philosophy, respectively logic, ethics, and physics, is ingenious but too crude and ultimately unconvincing, since logic had for the Stoics its own separate subject matter (not to be identified with ‘human and divine matters’, and not even with knowledge itself,paceBrouwer), and ethics and physics can themselves be described as forms of knowledge. The interconnected nature of Stoic philosophy, which is helpfully emphasized throughout the book, need not be mirrored in the very definition of wisdom. From a broader methodological point of view, the attempt to reconstruct anearlyStoic theory of wisdom constantly clashes with the nature of our evidence, and although in several cases Brouwer does carefully justify why a certain late source can be taken to bear witness to such an early theory, in other cases the reader is left to wonder whether such a justification could be given (for example, in the case of some passages from Seneca). There is still much worth pondering in Brouwer's insightful analyses in Chapters 2–4, although one is left to wonder how much added value has been generated by integrating this previously published material into a single monograph."

A key concept in their philosophy of mind is that of a cognitive faculty, located in and constitutive of the self. Cognitive faculties should be understood as processes or manners through which the self makes use of the physical sensory apparatus, as well as the actual application of the self’s cognitive potential. This chapter discusses the complex structures of cognitive faculties. Kundakunda takes the self, the cognitive subject, to consist in cognition, a claim which influences the way both thinkers classify cognitive faculties and the important distinction between perceptual experience and cognition."

It begins with an extended engagement with Nicholas Wolterstorff in order to argue that continental philosophy need not be viewed as inherently hostile to philosophical theology. Indeed, there are reasons to think that continental philosophy should be understood as an important resource for philosophical theology and philosophy of religion. With this meta-philosophical framework in place, possible specific ways in which continental philosophy might contribute to discussions concerning the epistemology of theology are then discussed. In particular, the chapter focuses on debates concerning foundationalism, experience, revelation, and realism/anti-realism."

In this sense, Philosophy of Education has been understood as a conflicting field due to these forces that is crossing its field. Therefore, there are some measures that are established for dealing with this situation, as suggestions from this study, pointing to the need for the discipline to monitories their own work with the attention it deserves, in the sense of stripping and minimize the difficulties of their teaching and the discipline proposal to be offer in the context of the teacher’s training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords: &lt;/strong&gt;Philosophy of Education; Philosophy and Education; Teachers training.&lt;/p&gt;"
10.4102/ids.v44i3/4.161,The role of the Bible in reformational  philosophy: historical and systematic  notes,"In this article the role of the Bible in the elaboration of refor-mational philosophy, a neo-calvinist school founded in the  1930s by Dooyeweerdand Vollenhoven, is analysed. According  to the author of this article, these two authors had somewhat  different approaches to this problem, but their intentions were  similar and the strategies they devised are compatible and even  integrating each other. In practice, one might say that Vollen-hoven favoured a more “textual” approach, while Dooyeweerd  emphasised the importance of the biblical religious ground  motive. The proposals of a more recent thinker in this move-ment, Jacob Klapwijk, are also explored and the promises and  the “perils” of his approach are pointed out. The main purpose  is to show that, in this philosophical tradition, the issue of the  role of the Bible in philosophy has been tackled with discern-ment and devotion, stemming from a genuine commitment to  the inscripturated Word."
10.1017/cjlj.2017.13,Revisiting Dworkin’s Philosophy of International Law: Could the Hedgehog Have Done It Any Other Way?,"This paper replies to the criticisms raised by Eric Scarffe and Thomas Christiano against Dworkin’s philosophy of international law. While the former argues that Dworkin’s philosophy of international law boils down into some form of political realism, the latter upholds that Dworkin’s attempt to ground the legitimacy of international law on the states’ duty to improve their own legitimacy is insufficient to establish a solid foundation for international obligations. In my response to these critics, I hold that they are based on an uncharitable and implausible reading of Dworkin’s theory of international law, since Dworkin’s theses about the law, whether we are considering “municipal” or “international” law, only make sense if they are understood in an interpretive way. This is, I submit, the only way to avoid turning Dworkin’s assumption of the “unity of value” into an implausible metaphysical theory of natural law. Once we adopt Dworkin’s interpretive attitude, it becomes clear that the route taken by Dworkin in “A New Philosophy for International Law” was the only route that remained available for his interpretive account of political legitimacy and the foundations of law."

I argue that two further, interim possibilities have been overlooked: that direct acquaintance involves purely phenomenal content or that direct acquaintance involves protoconceptual content.

It first considers Poincaré’s view that generalization is not a means to reach generality and that the issue of infinity is related to the theme of generality. It then shows how generality in mathematics and physics is construed by Poincaré in a very specific way and how he analyzes empirical induction in physics. It also analyzes the distinction suggested by Poincaré between generalizations used in mathematical physics and generalizations used by ‘naturalists’. In particular, it explains the distinction between mathematical generality and the so-called predicative generality. Finally, it compares Poincaré’s concern regarding empirical induction with Nelson Goodman’s ‘new riddle of induction’, arguing that ‘the new riddle of induction’ was originally formulated by Poincaré half a century earlier."

10.1515/opth-2015-0018,Language about God in Whitehead’s Philosophy,"AbstractThe way Whitehead speaks of God in his ‘philosophy of organism,’ and the evaluation thereof, is the subject of this article. The background of this issue is the position - broadly shared in theology, and here represented by Aquinas - that one should not speak ‘carelessly’ about God. Does Whitehead violate this rule, or does his language for God express God’s otherness and relatedness to the world in a new intriguing way? In order to answer this question an introduction into Whitehead’s philosophy is given, and especially into his category of existence, the ‘actual entity.’ For Whitehead God is an actual entity, and so is the most trivial puff of existence. His perception of the similarity and greater dissimilarity between God and the worldly actual entities (and clusters thereof) is analyzed. In the main and final section of this article these insights are used as a tool to decrypt Whitehead’s God-language. Here the status of Whitehead’s and Aquinas’ statements about God are compared, Whitehead’s ideas concerning the analogical character of concrete language are discussed, and it is argued that in Whitehead’s philosophy too there is no discourse about God without a shift or breakdown of the ‘ordinary’ meaning of language."

            Martin Heidegger argues against the possibility of Christian philosophy in his Introduction to Metaphysics. Christians, Heidegger tells us, cannot authentically ask the fundamental question of philosophy – ‘Why are there beings at all rather than nothing?’ – because they already suppose that they have an answer to this question in their Creator-God. Moreover, Christianity, says Heidegger, takes philosophy to be foolishness and, thus, would never try to answer its questions in the first place. Finally, Heidegger insists that any thoughtful questioning in a Christian context is theology and not philosophy. I argue that none of these reasons for rejecting Christian philosophy ultimately holds up. I also criticize an interpretation of Heidegger on this topic proposed by Walter Kaufmann."

Quine. Como Carnap, mas diferentemente de Quine, Peirce considera que o conhecimento científico reside em princípios lógicos que devem se sustentar  para que o discurso sobre o verdadeiro e o falso tenha sentido. Ele também compartilha a visão de Carnap de que esses princípios são anteriores à, e independentes das constatações nas ciências naturais, uma visão que Quine notoriamente rejeita. Todavia, como Quine, mas diferentemente de Carnap, Peirce insiste que não há conhecimento além daquele que é obtido por meio de testes empíricos, que as verdades da lógica estão epistemologicamente a par das verdades descobertas nas ciências naturais, e que nos revelam algo sobre como as coisas são, em vez de carecerem de conteúdo fatual, como Carnap afirma. Um ar de paradoxo emerge no comprometimento simultâneo de Peirce às visões comumente consideradas próprias das teorias epistemológicas incompatíveis. A análise desse paradoxo pela comparação da concepção de conhecimento de Peirce ao de Quine e Carnap nos ajuda a apreciar melhor sua importância na tradição filosófica e na profundeza e originalidade de suas razões."

10.1017/s0075426915000087,Late Neoplatonic discourses on suicide and the question of Christian philosophy professors at Alexandria,Abstract:The later Neoplatonic commentaries attributed to David and Elias are considered by many scholars to be the work of Christians who dominated the Alexandrian school in the latter half of the sixth century. Christian Wildberg has challenged this prevailing view: he argues that the commentaries are more likely the work of pagan philosophers. Scholars who support Christian authorship have appealed to the strict prohibition against suicide expressed in the parts of the commentaries that discuss Socrates’ characterization in thePhaedoof philosophy as the practice of death. But the proscription of suicide that the commentators read into thePhaedois consistent with the teachings of pagan Neoplatonists and thus provides no basis for a rejection of Wildberg’s thesis. I discuss the literary and historical exempla that the commentators use and propose that these are drawn in part from Gregory of Nazianzus’Invective against Julian.The connection between the discourses and Gregory’s text suggests that the commentators may have been deliberately responding to his accusations of pagan hypocrisy.
10.12737/12003,Non-stationary stationarity in systems of third type  and philosophy of instability,"There are several criteria in science for stationarity (stability) of different dynamical systems. The stationarity in physics, engineering and chemistry is being interpreted as matching the requirements of dx/dt=0, where x=x(t) - is the vector of system’s state, or the equality of distribution functions f(x) for different samples which characterize the system. However, in case of social or biological systems the matching of the requirements is impossible and there is a problem of specific assessment of stationary regimes of complex systems of the third type. The possibility of studying of such systems within the frame of deterministic chaos, stochastic approach and theory of chaos and self-organization is being discussed. This article explains why I.R. Prigogine refused from materialistic (in fact deterministic) approach in the description of such special systems of third type and tried to get away from the traditional science in the description of biological systems."

He believed that all sciences should progress from a static to a dynamic worldview, making them worthy of contemplation, feeding Reason rather than just understanding. Coleridge met Humphry Davy, whose dynamical researches on laughing gas and electrochemistry delighted him. Coleridge became a critic of science as well as literature, rejoicing as Davy isolated new metals, cast light on acidity, and invented the miners’ safety lamp. But after 1820 Davy turned haughty, and Coleridge deplored chemists’ empire-building as science became a professional career; while in medicine French materialism threatened the dynamic vitalism of John Hunter that Coleridge and his host James Gillman favoured.

Alternatives to the method of cases are critically examined: We cannot gain the required modal knowledge by relying on intuition, by analyzing the meaning of philosophically significant words, and by appealing to alleged theoretical virtues like simplicity, generality, and elegance to choose between philosophical views. Alternative conceptions of philosophy are too deflationary to be satisfying, particularly because there is much philosophizing left once philosophy is reoriented."

Therefore the need for a brief presentation of the third paradigm of theory of chaos and self-organization in all their diversity increases many times. It is possible to express the hope that this will lead to a change in not only science but also in consciousness (view of the natural world). The proof of differences of theory of chaos and self-organization (TCS), objects (STT) from objects of deterministic and stochastic approaches (paradigms) – DSP is needed. Furthermore, a demonstration of pointlessness use of methods and theories of DSP in describing the STT. These all requires the synergy of mutual tolerance by all scientists. We must move away from the revolution in T. Kuhn’s paradigm shift to synergy and parallel existence of three global paradigms (deterministic, stochastic and third – syn-ergetic). As in nature, there are (and will be) three types of systems and in science there should be three different approaches, three paradigms. V.S. Stepin talked about these things representing postnonclassic."

Thus, on the one hand, the evolution in crude empiricism and its transition to positivism, logical positivism and how to transition from positivism to falsifiability will be evaluated. On the other hand, we address the transformation of positivism and falsifiability attitudes and thinking into macro structures and attitudes in the form of Imre and Lakatos research program and Thomas Kuhn's paradigm and finally, Feyerabend anarchist approach. Then, we will continue with a brief overview of how to shape the post-modern approaches as the outcome of fundamental change in the attitude of philosophy in the West. Of course, we try to avoid getting into the details of the views, as far as possible because the main focus of this paper is on the analysis of the evolution of the methodological perspectives of ""Scientism (Philosophy of science)"" to postmodernism."

However, the existing literature showed that only limited studies focused in this specific moral belief development of undergraduates. Hence, the main aim of this study is to identify the level of personal moral philosophy (idealism and relativism) of undergraduates and to examine the relationship between the personal moral philosophy and undergraduates’ academic cheating behavior. Data were collected from 620 undergraduates through questionnaire surveys by employing a simple random sampling. The study found that undergraduates are lately more idealism compared to relativism, which indicated that students are aware with the academic cheating behavior and try to avoid involving in it. Future recommendations are provided to further understand the complexities associated with academic dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;"
10.1017/s0896082800000921,Talking in the Marketplace: A “New” Approach to Political Philosophy,"The standard approach to teaching political philosophy involves the transmission of a given body of information, organized either historically (Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Marx, Nietzsche, etc.) or topically (the state, freedom, equality, human rights, authority, etc.). The aim is to transfer a core of knowledge to the students, whose responsibility is to comprehend the factual material much as they would material in any other course.
            The historical and topical approaches to political philosophy are useful in that they allow the student to familiarize himself with the great themes of western (or world) civilization, but they have their limitations. The problem of these approaches, to use an expression of Edmund Husserl's is “sedimentation.” The tradition of philosophy is so covered with generations of silt that it is almost impossible to uncover the original experiences that led to the development of philosophy in the first place. To understand Nietzsche you have to understand Marx; to understand Marx you have to understand Hegel; to understand Hegel you have to understand Kant; to understand Kant you have to understand … ad infinitum until we reach … to understand Aristotle you have to understand Plato, and to understand Plato you have to understand Socrates.
            A second approach to political philosophy is more concerned with encouraging students to engage in philosophical reflection than it is in developing the mastery of scholarship encouraged by the first approach. This second approach returns us to the origins of political philosophy."

The main objective of this work is to develop a mobility study of automotive vehicles in Goiás Avenue, the main avenue of São Caetano do Sul, Brazilian city with the highest Human Development Index (HDI). Three alternative scenarios for traffic improvement were studied using an agent-based simulation model: Speed Reduction, Green Wave Implementation and a mixed scenario that combines these two approaches. The main results evaluated were average vehicle crossing time, average time spent in queues and total number of vehicles that leave the system during rush hours. It was concluded that, among the proposed scenarios, a mixed one should be implemented as it has favorable results in all of the studied performance indicators and maximizes the benefits generated by the other two scenarios. It is expected that the results of this study will serve to encourage further research in this area and give continuity to the idea of a digital city."

10.1017/s0007087415000667,Newton and scholastic philosophy,"AbstractThis article examines Isaac Newton's engagement with scholastic natural philosophy. In doing so, it makes two major historiographical interventions. First of all, the recent claim that Newton's use of the concepts of analysis and synthesis was derived from the Aristotelianregressustradition is challenged on the basis of bibliographical, palaeographical and intellectual evidence. Consequently, a new, contextual explanation is offered for Newton's use of these concepts. Second, it will be shown that some of Newton's most famous pronouncements – from the General Scholium appended to the second edition of thePrincipia(1713) and from elsewhere – are simply incomprehensible without an understanding of specific scholastic terminology and its later reception, and that this impacts in quite significant ways on how we understand Newton's natural philosophy more generally. Contrary to the recent historiographical near-consensus, Newton did not hold an elaborate metaphysics, and his seemingly ‘metaphysical’ statements were in fact anti-scholastic polemical salvoes. The whole investigation will permit us a brief reconsideration of the relationship between the self-proclaimed ‘new’ natural philosophy and its scholastic predecessors."

Some Comments on Wang Jianjiang's Article ‘The Bustle and the Absence of Zhuyi’”),"Aleš Erjavec proposed the global philosophical quadrilateral, giving Chinese philosophy, aesthetics, and humanities an expectation. However, the realization of this expectation hinges on the question whether Chinese philosophy as well as aesthetics and the humanities can rid themselves of the staggering level of ‘voice’ and develop their ‘speech’. To make ‘speech’, any nation should have its own idea, theory and Zhuyi. How to overcome the embarrassment that ‘quadrilateral’ expectation implies? Time spatialization and four-phase development theories of the Bie-modern, and great leap forward pause theory have provided an answer. The quadrilateral expectation as shown by Aleš Erjavec, is encountering the antagonism between ‘cosmopolitanism’ and ‘nationalism’. The key to resolving this antagonism is ‘my’ original achievement consisting of ‘Chinese traditional philosophy, Western philosophy, Marxism and I (myself)’. Bie-modernism is a Zhuyi of self-regulation, self-renewal and self-transcendence and of their practical implementation. Article received: May 21, 2017; Article accepted: May 24, 2017; Original scholarly paperHow to cite this article: Jianjiang, Wang.

Recent explanations of religion and their challenges to contemporary philosophy of religion,"SummaryRecent studies based on evolutionary approaches to human life, among them the so-called Cognitive Science of Religion (CSR), point to a variety of natural conditions for religion. These studies then re-open the whole discussion about natural religion from a non-theological angle. They thereby also allow for a new discussion about the conditions for understanding religion in general. The question about evolved natural conditions for, and concrete historical content of, religion is addressed from both the point of view of Schleiermacher’s philosophy of religion, and N. Barrett’s integrative scientific critique of CSR. The present argument suggests that more emphasis should be on the concrete experiences articulated in a religious context, and accordingly, also more openness for a perspective on religion that allows for a first- and second-person perspective."

Tomando o pensamento de Nietzsche e de Freud como eixo de interlocução, procura evidenciar que ambos os autores trataram de empreender a destruição das evidências acerca do entendimento do sujeito e do lugar da subjetividade na história da Razão ocidental. A hipótese central é que a análise da teoria das pulsões em Nietzsche foi uma contribuição decisiva para o próprio entendimento de Freud acerca dos instintos e das pulsões em sua segunda tópica. Se a psicanálise dialoga desde o seu início com a filosofia, é possível sustentar que tal empreendimento não pode mais deixar de ocorrer, pois a temática do sujeito e sua constituição tornaram-se cruciais para o avanço do pensamento filosófico e psicanalítico. "

Paul Livingston adalah profesor filsafat di University of New Mexico. Ia mendalami filsafat kesadaran (mind), filsafat bahasa, fenomenologi, filsafat politik, serta menaruh minat besar pada filsafat ilmu. Beberapa karyanya: The Logic of Being: Realism, Truth, and Time (Northwestern, 2017); The Politics of Logic: Badiou, Wittgenstein, and the Consequence of Formalism (Routledge, 2011); Philosophy and the Vision of Language (Routledge, 2008); serta Philosophical History and the Problem of Consciousness (Cambridge, 2004).&#x0D;
Penulis kedua, Andrew Cutrofello, adalah profesor filsafat di Loyola University of Chicago. Cutrofello mengkhususkan ranah penelitiannya pada Kant, Hegel, dan filsafat kontinental. Saat ini, Cutrofello sedang menggeluti soal titik temu antara filsafat dan kesusasteraan, khususnya puisi-puisi berbahasa Inggris. Karya-karya Cutrofello di antaranya: Beyond the Analytic-Continental Divide: Pluralist Philosophy in the Twenty-First Century (Routledge, 2015)—buku yang disunting bersama Jeffrey Bell dan Paul Livingston; All for Nothing: Hamlet’s Negativity (MIT, 2014); dan Continental Philosophy: A Contemporary Introduction (Routledge, 2005).&#x0D;

Sebagai catatan, keterbatasan PCP sebagaimana diakui oleh Livingston dan Cutrefello sendiri terletak pada fokus dan pembatasan mengenai persoalan-persoalan filosofis itu sendiri. Kedua penulis tersebut memusatkan perhatian pada beberapa persoalan mendasar yang menarik perhatian para filsuf kontemporer. Karena itu, Livingston dan Cutrefello tidak menawarkan sebuah pemetaan komprehensif dan utuh mengenai semua persoalan filosofis. Keterbatasan lainnya juga terletak pada pembahasan yang berorientasi seputar filsafat Eropa dan Anglo-Amerika sehingga meminggirkan tradisi-tradisi lainnya. Bahkan, pembahasan Livingston dan Cutrefello secara eksklusif terpusat pada filsafat-filsafat yang ditulis atau diterjemahkan ke dalam bahasa Inggris saja sehingga mengecualikan berbagai kajian filsafat di luar bahasa Inggris.

This volume continues the initial intention behind the series of attracting the best work from the premier philosophers of religion, as well as including work by top philosophers outside this area when their work and interests intersect with issues in the philosophy of religion.

As a virtuoso, physics replaces metaphysics in his philosophical system. His ontology, however, includes not only bodies, but God and finite spirits, and its major achievement is to prove the existence of God and demonstrate his immateriality. Perhaps encouraged by reading Cudworth, Locke was confident that our faculty of reason is sufficient to refute materialism and atheism. As to the nature of bodies, Locke finds empirical evidence that solidity or impenetrability is their most evident quality. The idea of superaddition is central to Locke’s speculative or divine physics. But although such insights may elevate the mind to God, Locke’s physics is theoretically sterile, although it may have beneficial practical uses."

Locke’s thoughts about ethics expressed in the Essay and other writings are examined, their sources identified, and the systematic connections between them are considered. Hellenistic sources, especially Epicurean ones, are identified, along with the ethical rationalism and naturalism of Hugo Grotius. Following Grotius, Locke developed a theory of the law of nature, rooted in social convenience, but sanctioned by divine command. In Some Thoughts concerning Education, Locke advocated the cultivation of virtues suitable to the moral and civic life of a gentleman. His abortive attempt to develop a system of ethics in ‘Of Ethics in General’, intended as a chapter of the Essay, but abandoned, brings the reader back to the opening question. Locke concluded that revelation is a more reliable source of moral knowledge."

Words and ideas are combined in definitions and causal statements. One of the main goals of the Essay is to determine the nature and limits of knowledge and belief. Locke concludes that a science of nature is impossible to us, because human understanding cannot gain access into the essence or inner constitution of things, material or spiritual, but that a science of morality is possible, because the objects of moral reflection, moral ideas, are fully comprehensible to us. With regard to other things, material or spiritual, the mind must be content with probable belief. Locke concludes the Essay claiming that morality is the proper business of mankind in this life."

He transforms Aristotelian contemplation into “sociable wisdom” by becoming a “new figure” of the philosopher, an “unpremeditated and accidental philosopher.” The new figure of the philosopher is the “social-Subject” (the counterpart of Machiavelli’s “political-Subject” and Descartes’s “epistemological-SSubject”). Montaigne’s invention of the essay is, at the same time, the invention of modern society, a new form of association that overcomes the ancient hierarchy of weak and strong, masters and slaves. The unpremeditated and accidental philosopher does not attain the good as his natural end; he produces the good as his own effect. Society, then, has a philosophical, not a natural, origin. Montaigne’s “originality” is to be this origin."

It spans philosophy of law, logic, politics, environment, and society, but is most strongly associated with wide-ranging discussions in the philosophy of mind and language, epistemology and metaphysics (how we know and what is there to be known), ethics, meta-ethics, and aesthetics, and meta-philosophy. The reach of Indian ideas has been vast, both historically and geographically, and it has been and continues to be a major influence in world philosophy. In the breadth as well as the depth of its philosophical investigation, in the sheer bulk of surviving texts and in the diffusion of its ideas, the philosophical heritage of India easily stands comparison with that of China, Greece, the Latin West, or the Islamic world."

The essay seeks to demonstrate that even in areas such as these, which are assumed to be relatively well known, matters may be not quite so clear as people are wont to believe. The field remains open to, and in need of, revised and improved interpretation of the familiar no less than of topics that seem more obscure."

It focuses in particular on the impact of Lutheran beliefs, which have tended to receive less attention than seventeenth-century British Puritanism. After a brief discussion of changing historical ideas about Protestantism and science, it examines the specific ways in which Protestant theology influenced the natural philosophy practiced by its believers. It then discusses the reforms to natural philosophy developed by Luther and his disciple Philip Melanchthon and focuses on two areas of natural philosophy that were affected most strongly by Lutheran theology: medicine and astronomy. Finally, it shows the ways that trends in Protestant theology in the seventeenth century continued to influence ideas about natural philosophy, albeit in more diverse ways."

It might be helpful, therefore, to consider issues surrounding the relationship between globalization and local values in light of previous forms of this discussion. To this end, I would like to reflect on the discussion of context in the writings of al-Farabi, Ibn Sina and al-Ghazali. To focus this paper, I will consider only three issues, namely that of history, science and the role of reason in religion. I will argue that al-Farabi and Ibn Sina present an account of context that begins with experience as a foundation and then moves to the universal, emphasizing the importance of tradition, demonstration and rationality. Against these two, al-Ghazali argues for the importance of leaving behind experience in order to reach that which is certain, emphasizing the supernatural, intuition and mystical. My goal is to draw out some implications these writers recognized followed from their often dense and esoteric discussions of the nature of particulars and universals, and conclude with some suggestions for our contemporary situation."

Tal fusão, para o caso de uma prosa filosófico-literária que esmaece as fronteiras entre o exterior e o interior, sugere uma especulação a respeito do potencial formativo e autoformativo das coisas que habitam a camada mais epidérmica do mundo: até onde elas “formam” o expectador  e se deixam “formar” por ele? &#x0D;

Such fusion, in the case of a philosophical-literary prose which fades the frontiers between the exterior and the interior, suggests a speculation regarding the formative and auto-formative potential of things that reside in the world's most epidermal layer: to what extent do they ""form"" the spectator and to what extent do they allow themselves to be ""formed"" by them?&#x0D;

10.4102/ids.v47i1.719,Three I know not what:The influence of Greek philosophy on the doctrine of Trinity,"This article examines the origins of the traditional or orthodox Trinitarian formula. The main objective is to clarify to what extent the traditional Christian doctrine of the Trinity (Nicene formula) has been influenced by Greek philosophy. Through contemporary theological dialogue on this issue, the research focuses on the comparison between the traditional formulation of the doctrine of Trinity, influenced by Greek philosophy and the biblical revelation of the godhead. The conclusion is that the trinitarian formula might not be a dogmatic teaching, but a mystery (a dehellenisation of the concept of Trinity) and that the Church fathers and the post-Nicene church used the Greek philosophical-theological expressions for Trinity, already present in Scriptures in its doxological and liturgical form, primarily for the purpose of contextualisation.Hierdie artikel ondersoek die oorsprong van die tradisionele of ortodokse trinitariese leerstuk. Die hoofdoel is om uit te vind tot watter mate die tradisioneel Christelike leer oor die Drie-eenheid (Niceense formule) deur die Griekse filosofie beïnvloed is. Deur die hedendaagse teologiese debat oor hierdie onderwerp na te gaan, fokus die navorsing op ’n vergelyking tussen die tradisionele formulering van die leer van die Drie-eenheid soos beïnvloed deur die ortodokse Griekse filosofie en deur die bybelse openbaring van die godheid. Die slotsom waartoe gekom word, is dat die trinitariese formule moontlik nie ’n dogmatiese leerstuk was nie, maar ’n misterie (’n dehellenisering van die Drie-eenheidsbegrip). Die kerkvaders en die post-Niceense kerk het die Griekse filosofies-teologiese uitdrukkings vir die Drie-eenheid, wat alreeds in die Skrif in sy doksologiese en liturgiese vorm voorgekom het, moontlik slegs vir die doel van kontekstualisering gebruik."
10.1017/s0017816015000516,"Covenant, History, and the Holocaust: Revisiting Emil Fackenheim's Jewish Philosophy","In the twentieth century, historical circumstance in the form of the Holocaust led to theodicy's returning to the forefront of the philosophical agenda, particularly in Jewish thought. As a result, post-Holocaust theology is almost always an element of introductory courses on modern and contemporary Jewish philosophy, if not introductory courses on modern Judaism simpliciter. Many working in the field of Jewish philosophy, therefore, probably first encounter Emil Fackenheim (1916–2003), and the infamous turn of phrase that ensured his immortality in the realm of Jewish thought, early on in their studies. Fackenheim was one of the most influential post-Holocaust philosophical voices in what soon became a cacophony. This German-born philosopher's (and ordained Reform rabbi's) concept of the 614th commandment—not to grant Hitler a posthumous victory (in his own words “the only statement of mine that ever became famous”)—has captured the imagination of many a student and often made a lasting impression. Yet it seems that one of the concerns at the forefront of this new expansive monograph on Fackenheim's philosophy is that for the majority, this constitutes both their first and last exposure to his thought, leaving them with an extremely contracted view of his conceptual palate. The result, noted in the book's introduction, is that Fackenheim has never really been considered a Jewish philosopher worthy of mention in the same breath as Hermann Cohen, Franz Rosenzweig, or even latterly Emmanuel Levinas and Joseph Soloveitchik. In this volume, a case is presented for including him on that list."

This paper examines the adequacy of applying the common methodology of experimental philosophy to the study of moral thought. By employing Raimond Gaita's notion of moral seriousness and his distinction between form and content, it argues that the kind of empirical research on moral intuitions conducted by experimental philosophers fails to take into consideration some fundamental characteristics of moral thinking."

First, I argue that changing the traditional definition of knowledge should not imply skepticism. Instead, scientific models of the mind can serve as an epistemological guide for defining the acquisition of knowledge as a dynamic process, where the learner interacts with reality. Second, I argue that these models can portray reality, though not in a direct and complete way. In this sense, science is regarded as providing a diversely-grained group of models that can be compared by philosophy in order to improve philosophical discussions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

The solution cannot be approached only technically and partialy, but instead, in a more comprehensive-holistic way by radically changing the perspective and the nature of  human behaviour, which means, they are to be tuned in to the environmental ethics. Accordingly, human behaviour is to be conceived of and conducted in line with &lt;em&gt;eco-philosophy&lt;/em&gt;. Its political praxis is to be implemented by way of politics of law (&lt;em&gt;rechtspolitiek&lt;/em&gt;), politics of environmental law in particular.

This, in turn, can only be implemented if the constitution as well as the legislation is already ‘green’."
10.1017/s0017383517000134,Philosophy,"As A. K. Cotton acknowledges at the beginning of her monograph Platonic Dialogue and the Education of the Reader, ‘the idea that a reader's relationship with Plato's text is analogous to that of the respondent with the discussion leader’ within the dialogue, and ‘that we engage in a dialogue with the text almost parallel to theirs’, ‘is almost a commonplace of Platonic criticism’ (4). But Cotton has the merit of articulating this commonplace much more clearly and precisely than is often done, and of asking how exactly the dialogue between interlocutors is supposed to affect the dialogue of the reader with the text, and what kind of reader response Plato is inviting. Not surprisingly, her starting point is Plato's notorious (written) concerns about written texts expressed in the Phaedrus: ‘writing cannot contain or convey knowledge’, and will give to the ‘receiver’ the mistaken perception that he or she has learned something – that is, has acquired knowledge – from reading (6–7). She claims that the Phaedrus also suggests, however, that a written text, in the right hands, ‘may have a special role to play in awakening the soul of its receiver towards knowledge’ (17). I have no doubt that Plato thought as much, but Cotton's reference to the language of hupomnēmata at 276d3, and to the way in which sensible images act as hupomnēmata for the recollection of the Forms earlier in the dialogue, fails to support her case: Socrates remarks in that passage that writings can serve only as ‘reminders’ for their authors (16). The book's central thesis is that the way in which writing can awaken the reader's soul ‘towards knowledge’ is not by pointing the reader, however indirectly, implicitly, non-dogmatically, or even ironically, towards the right views, but by developing the reader/learner's ‘ability to engage in a certain way’ in dialectical inquiry (26). The familiar developments between ‘early’, ‘middle’, and ‘late’ dialogues are thus accepted but seen as part of a single coherent educational project towards the reader's/learner's full development of what Cotton calls ‘dialectical virtue’. Plato's reader is invited to treat the characterization of the interlocutors within the dialogues, and the description of their dialectical behaviour, ‘as a commentary on responses appropriate and inappropriate in the reader’ (28). Cotton's programme, clearly sketched in Chapter 1, is ambitious and sophisticated, and is carried out with impressive ingenuity in the following six chapters (the eighth and final chapter, besides summarizing some of the book's conclusions, introduces a notion of ‘civic virtue’ which does not appear to be sufficiently grounded on the analyses in the rest of the book). An especially instructive aspect of her inquiry is the attention paid to the ‘affective’ dimension of the interlocutor's and reader's responses: through the representation of the interlocutors in his written dialogues, and the labours to which he submits us as readers, Plato teaches us that ‘the learner's engagement must be cognitive-affective in character; and it involves a range of specific experiences, including discomfort, frustration, anger, confusion, disbelief, and a desire to flee’ (263). Perhaps because of her belief that what the Platonic dialogues are about is not philosophical views or doctrines but a process of education in ‘dialectical virtue’, Cotton has remarkably little to say concerning the psychological and epistemological underpinnings of the views on, and methods of, education which she attributes to Plato. The Cave allegory in the Republic, which is unsurprisingly adopted as an instructive image of Plato's insights on learning and educational development in Chapter 2, is discussed without any reference to the various cognitive stages which the phases of the ascent in and outside the Cave are meant to represent. Two central features of Plato's conception of learning identified by Cotton – the individual learner's own efforts and participation, and the necessity of some trigger to catalyse the learning process (263) – are not connected, as one might well have expected, to the ‘theory of recollection’ or the related imagery of psychic pregnancy or Socratic midwifery. Even Cotton's laudable stress on the ‘affective’ aspects of the learning process could have been helpfully complemented by some consideration of Platonic moral psychology. Despite these reservations, and the unavoidable limitations and oversimplifications involved in any attempt to characterize Plato's corpus as one single, unified project, I believe that readers with an interest in Platonic writing and method will benefit greatly from Cotton's insightful inquiry."

He was also the first Orthodox theologian to teach at Harvard Divinity School (1957–1964). In the 1920s, Florovsky wrote and defended his dissertation on the leading nineteenth-century Russian public intellectual, Alexander Herzen (1812–1870). Until now, the full text of Florovsky's work had been considered lost. I recently found five documents containing a substantial portion of the dissertation in the Georges Florovsky Papers archive of the St Vladimir's Seminary Library (GFP SVS). This newly discovered material amounts to about one-half of the dissertation and contains some important clues for reconstructing the remaining half of the work. My article discusses: 1) the plan of the dissertation and the history of its composition; 2) Florovsky's defense of the dissertation in Prague in 1923, as summarized in Alexander Izgoev's report, preserved in the Georges Florovsky Papers at the Princeton University Library (GFP PUL); 3) Florovsky's preparation of the dissertation for publication; 4) the description of the newly discovered archival material; and 5) the reconstruction of the dissertation, as preserved in the redactions of 1928–1930. The dissertation is the only monographic study that Florovsky ever finished, his other book-length studies being surveys rather than monographs. The dissertation is also important for understanding the methodological presuppositions of Florovsky's magnum opus,The Ways of Russian Theology(1937)."

Ressalta-se o caráter político da pena e a inevitabilidade do debate normativo para sua compreensão. Na sequência, investiga-se a moldura liberal da compreensão da pena estatal e sugere-se a necessidade de um horizonte coletivo e republicano para as práticas de censura, como rota de fuga das contradições inerentes ao liberalismo penal. Aponta-se para o debate acerca da participação popular na formulação de políticas voltadas para a questão criminal e para sua proximidade com o debate acerca do próprio significado de democracia. Ao final, as práticas restaurativas são sugeridas como possibilidade de apreensão coletiva dos problemas discutidos, desde que bem ressaltadas as noções de responsabilidade e participação política dos sujeitos envolvidos. AbstractFrom Sen’s notion of development we discuss the compatibility, in the context of political philosophy, of state punishment with the goal of expanding freedom. We emphasize the political nature of punishment and the unavoidability of a normative discussion to access it. Next, we investigate state punishment’s liberal framework. The need of a republican approach for understanding the practices of censorship is suggested as an escape route from the inherent contradictions of penal liberalism. We point at the debate on popular participation on criminal policies and at its closeness to the debate on the very meaning of democracy. Restorative practices are suggested as a possibility of a collective seizure of the key matters discussed, as long as well emphasized the notions of responsibility and political participation of the subjects involved."

His most sustained work on international law is a posthumously published article, “A New Philosophy for International Law” (2013), which displays some familiar aspects of his views in general jurisprudence, in addition to some novel (though perhaps surprising) arguments as well. This paper argues that the moralized account of international law we might have expected is conspicuously missing from this posthumous article; with Dworkin advancing an argument based on a form of political realism instead."

The first two translations were executed in the Midi, around the year 1199: once from Constantine the African's Latin version, by an anonymous physician who used the pseudonym “Doeg the Edomite”; and a second time from Arabic, by Samuel Ibn Tibbon in Béziers, using as hisVorlageḤunayn Ibn Isḥāq's Arabic version (al-Ṣināʿa al-saġīra), accompanied by ʿAlī Ibn Riḍwān's commentary. (Samuel Ibn Tibbon's authorship of this translation has been called into doubt, but is reestablished in a paper by Gad Freudenthal in this issue ofASP.) A third translation, again from Latin and including Ibn Riḍwān's commentary, was done by Hillel ben Samuel in Rome, in the late thirteenth century, but is not considered in this paper.We present theTegniand discuss its history. We then ask why this work was translated into Hebrew twice, at precisely the same time and area. We show that both translators responded to the need of Jewish physicians who read only Hebrew. Doeg's translation was part of his vast project of making the greater part of the Salernitan corpus available in Hebrew. Samuel Ibn Tibbon translated theTegniwith Ibn Riḍwān's commentary both because he was responding to a social need and because he was in the process of switching his profession from physician to translator of philosophic works. Galen's medico-philosophic text was a perfect fit for his intellectual evolution from a philosophically minded physician to a philosopher-scientist."

This essay takes up those differences from an ontological and epistemological point of view suggested by a number of feminist philosophers but not fully examined in the work of Beauvoir and Irigaray. This includes Beauvoir’s rejection of dualist thinking produced by the binary logic of the Law of Excluded Middle, and Irigaray’s critique of formal logic based on her psychoanalytic perspective. Beginning with Beauvoir and moving from there to Irigaray, the essay takes up the question of the ontological and epistemological structures utilized by each of these two feminist philosophers with an eye to their subsequent ethical implications."
10.1093/oso/9780190601294.003.0010,Philosophy as Commitment (1952),"Here Leopoldo Zea, the presumptive leader of the Hiperión group, appeals to Sartrean existentialism in order to make his case for the responsibility of philosophy and philosophers. He writes that persons have been thrown into a world that they did not create, which places them in the presence of others for whom they are now responsible. Just as Sartre had announced that persons were condemned to be free, Zea here proclaims that they are condemned to this commitment and this responsibility. This is a call to all Mexican and Latin American philosophers who might believe that the labor of philosophy is of little consequence or that the responsibilities they assume as philosophers are only provisional. Indeed, philosophy as commitment is a philosophy for one’s world, one’s circumstance, and one’s fellows."
10.1093/oso/9780190601294.003.0006,The History of Philosophy in Mexico (1943),"The selection is the result of a series of courses Samuel Ramos gave on the history of philosophy in Mexico. More than providing a mere survey of schools and doctrines in Mexico, beginning with the Aztecs, Ramos attempts to articulate what would make philosophy Mexican, in part by demonstrating what has made the majority of philosophy in Mexico either un-philosophical (e.g., the Aztecs) or un-Mexican (e.g., Mexican Scholasticism). In short, a philosophy is not Mexican if it is imitative or uncritical, unoriginal, and/or unresponsive to Mexican circumstances. And he argues that although there are a few scattered antecedents—notably Benito Díaz de Gamarra—it is not until the twentieth century that Mexican philosophers identify the “the epistemological justification of a national philosophy,” which Ramos claims (somewhat controversially) is based largely on the philosophy of Ortega y Gasset."
10.1093/oso/9780190601294.001.0001,Mexican Philosophy in the 20th Century,"Sánchez and Sanchez have selected, edited, translated, and written an introduction to some of the most influential texts in 20th century Mexican philosophy. Together, these texts reveal and give shape to a unique and robust tradition that will certainly challenge and complicate traditional conceptions of philosophy. The texts collected here are organized chronologically and represent a period of Mexican thought and culture that emerges out of the Mexican Revolution of 1910 and cultimates in la filosofía de lo mexicano (the philosophy of Mexicanness), which reached its peak in the 1950s. Though the selections respond to a variety of philosophical questions and themes and will be of interest to a wide range of readers, they represent a tendency to take seriously the question of Mexican national identity as a philosophical question—an issue that is complicated by Mexico’s indigenous and European ancestries, its history of colonialism, and its growing dependency on foreign money and culture. More than an attempt simply to describe the national character, however, the texts gathered here represent an optimistic period in Mexican philosophy that aimed to affirm Mexican philosophy as a valuable, if not urgent, contribution to universal thought and culture."
10.1093/oso/9780190601294.003.0008,Two Ideas of Philosophy (1940),"The question concerning the possibility of a Mexican or Spanish-American philosophy, an important issue for Gaos, sounds metaphilosophical, but in this debate, Larroyo dismisses the idea of metaphilosophy as an absurdity, which is either a contradiction in terms or leads to an infinite regress. For Larroyo, the task of defining philosophy is as old as philosophy itself and does not require the “new” discipline of metaphilosophy. This selection illustrates how questions about the definition and scope of philosophy were increasingly becoming a subject of public debate, thus contributing to the normalization of philosophy. Questions regarding whether philosophy is a science, as Larroyo thought, or a personal confession, as Gaos thought, or whether the essence of the psychology of the philosopher is arrogance or humility are relevant not only to the possibility of Mexican philosophy, but also to determinations of the value or relevance of philosophy in Mexican society at large."
10.1093/oso/9780190468712.003.0002,The Philosophy of Imagination,"In this chapter various understandings of imagination from antiquity to the present day are presented and interpreted. On this background a new interpretation of imagination grounded in a philosophy of experience is introduced. With a departure point in contemporary philosophy as well as ancient Greek and Jewish thought, the author presents the theories of imagination formulated by Plato, Aristotle, and Kant, along with interpretations of their thinking from the hermeneutic phenomenological tradition. Other important positions from the medieval and modern periods are also addressed, including those of Vico and Baumgarten. The chapter shows that imagination is essential to cognition, moral action, and aesthetic experience. It is also evidenced from this chapter that imagination is crucial to a kind of thinking that has been called “sensitive,” “aesthetic,” and “expanded” and that is a presupposition of thinking and acting led by both reason and understanding."
10.1093/oso/9780190601294.003.0004,Neither Irrationalism nor Rationalism but Critical Philosophy (1928),"José Romano Muñoz defends Antonio Caso’s “intuitionism” against Samuel Ramos’s criticisms, which Ramos had published in the same journal (Ulysses) the previous year. In his dismissal, Ramos argues that Caso’s intuitionism is merely a form of irrationalism that has no place in philosophy as a rational practice. In Caso’s defense, Muñoz proposes that intuition has epistemological value, that it alone can penetrate the reality of things that are hidden by concepts and obscured by perception, and that Caso’s philosophy shows us how this is so. This article is both a defense of philosophy as traditionally conceived—as rational and critical—and an attempt to broaden its scope to include invention, intuition, and instinct. A true critical philosophy cannot rely merely on reason as its source, but must involve and depend on intuition and the non-rational clarity that this brings."
10.1093/oso/9780190638054.003.0002,Philosophy of Science,"Psychology grew out of philosophy, and the science of psychology is at the heart of how psychologists develop a body of knowledge. Despite the central role of science and philosophy in psychology, sport and exercise psychologists often ignore issues related to philosophy of science. This chapter discusses the scientific method upon which most quantitative research is based. It also discusses ontological and epistemological issues and the various philosophical assumptions that underpin research. In particular, two epistemological opposites are addressed, social constructionism and cognitivism, along with their strengths and weaknesses and resultant implications for past and future research. Because psychology is inherently the study of how and why people think and act, to completely disavow the mind as the primary cause of human agency is antithetical to the discipline and profession of psychology. Thus considerable attention is given to refuting critics who refute the primacy of the mind and its role in human behavior while still acknowledging that social, environmental, and culture factors play important roles in people’s lives."
10.1093/oso/9780190690120.003.0011,Philosophy of Science,"This chapter articulates Adam Smith’s philosophy of science. The first section emphasizes the significance of Smith’s social conception of science—science takes place, not always comfortably, within a larger society and is itself a social enterprise in which our emotions play a crucial role. Even so, in Smith’s view science ultimately is a reason-giving enterprise, akin to how he understands the role of the impartial spectator. The second and third sections explain Smith’s attitude to theorizing and its relationship, if any, to Humean skepticism. Smith distinguishes between theory acceptance and the possibility of criticism; while he accepts fallibilism, he also embraces scientific revolutions and even instances of psychological incommensurability. His philosophy is not an embrace of Humean skepticism, but a modest realism. Finally, the chapter explores the implications of Smith’s analysis of scientific systems as machines."
10.1093/oso/9780190690120.003.0007,Adam Smith’s Foundations for Political Philosophy,"This chapter sketches Adam Smith’s political philosophy, which is the activity of a citizen belonging to a particular community at given time and place. This project is neither exclusively descriptive nor only focused on what is commonly thought attainable. For Smith, the historical baseline of one’s time has normative significance. He does not resist changes from the status quo, but whatever changes he proposes are constrained by existing institutional arrangements. Part of the philosopher’s task is to offer visions of society that, while not impossible, are more just and more reasonable. One way in which such a vision can be offered is via historical narrative, which reveals the nature of that baseline and makes visible a second-order reflection on the ways it might be altered. In doing so, the philosopher offers an image that may speak simultaneously to one’s own society and those in others, including future ones."
10.1515/kier.2013.2013.1.377,Kierkegaard and the Traditions of the Comic in Philosophy,"AbstractThe paper relates Kierkegaard’s body of thought on the comic, irony, and humor to ten traditions of the comic (eight dating from antiquity and two from modern and postmodern times) that represent philosophy’s complex relationship with the comic. I emphasize the ancient, medieval, and Renaissance roots in Kierkegaard’s vision of the comic and in doing so hope to fill a gap within the pertinent scholarship. In particular, I inquire into the sources of his thought in and his indebtedness to these traditions in order to determine how, if at all, his conception of the comic, irony, and humor may be deemed original."
10.1017/s1752196317000372,“A Fountainhead of Pure Musical Americana”: Hobo Philosophy in Harry Partch's Bitter Music,"Abstract
            Largely because of its troubled publication history, Bitter Music—Harry Partch's journal of a portion of his travels as a hobo—has attracted little scholarly or popular attention. This article aims to help elucidate Bitter Music by examining the influence of hobo philosophy on its creation and reception. Certain aspects of the historical and current hobo subculture's ideology—particularly bricolage, anarcho-syndicalism, radical egalitarianism, and non-hierarchical temporal perception—appear to motivate various factors in Partch's creation of the journal and his later attempts to destroy it. Additionally, I examine how hobo philosophy animates Partch's approach to speech, song, and instrumental music, culminating in a close reading of the journal's longest musical-textual entry. The article concludes with an examination of how Bitter Music’s publication history further enhances the resonance of hobo philosophy with the ways in which the journal is apprehended by readers and, in the current century, listeners."
10.1017/s0533245100031023,IV. Philosophy and Science: The Authority of Argument,"Socrates is one of the iconic figures of the classical city – yet he wrote nothing. His teaching consisted in conversations with the people he met (we are told), particularly in the very highest circles of the cultivated and the powerful. He was prosecuted and put to death – and his execution has become the paradigmatic image of the man of principle standing firmly and calmly by his principles to the point of death, an image that Christian martyrology learnt a lot from. Socrates, however, is written about by many. He appears on the comic stage of Aristophanes as a leading sophist, he is memorialized by his followers, for example by Xenophon in his Memorabilia, Apology and Oikonomikos, and in particular he is the leading figure in the dialogues of Plato. It is first with Plato’s massive contribution to the invention of prose that this chapter is concerned."
10.26417/ejms.v6i1.p305-307,Theories of Death with a Special Reference to Indian Philosophy,"Most of the philosophers deal with the quality of life, assuming a long span covering all phases. Therefore it is a commonly idealized life. But during the course the life as we advance, there are numerous riddles of self and the universe we live in it to encounter. Certain questions that have not only puzzled the common man but also the intellectuals had been like, Is there any meaning behind every happening? How ought we to live? Is there any life after death? Is death as such is the true end of all activities and so on. However, when the subject of death comes the answers through theories or philosophies have not been very convincing or suitable to all the rungs of the society. This could be mostly due to our evading the very subject of death much owing to the general uneasiness, fear and a sort of psychological insecurity, while dealing with it. Therefore it is always easy to raise philosophical questions than to answer them. There are almost two dozen theories in vogue which have certain basic assumptions but somehow they do not fall in the domain of truly scientific inquiry. They are to be accepted as an outcome of religious sentiments or wishful thinking. This paper highlights the salient features of Indian philosophical viewpoint with regard to death."
10.17158/327,Being-for-Itself as Freedom: A Preliminary Inquiry on Jean-Paul Sartre’s Philosophy of the Human Person,"&lt;p&gt;Being-for-Itself as Freedom: A Preliminary Inquiry on Jean-Paul Sartre’s Philosophy of the Human Person exposes the principles behind Sartre’s assertion of the human person as condemned by his own freedom and as a useless passion. In pursuit of developing reasons and meaning of Sartrean concept of Human Person, the researcher employed qualitative-descriptive design guided by the method of hermeneutics. The findings manifest two essential points on Being and Nothingness. Sartre talks about essence and appearances which are the two aspects of Being. Essence and appearances are one. Essence is just a chain in the series of appearances. However, Sartre also speaks about Nothingness and affirms the permanent possibility of nonbeing. For him, non-being is the limitation of one’s inquiry on what exists, and that is the realm beyond being. Hence, it is to say that nothingness is that which exists outside what is existent (i.e., Being), and conversely, ‘Being is that and outside of that nothing. Indeed, Being and Nothingness are both what really exist. They imply the ‘evident and ‘non-evident’. Another point is that man is enmeshed into existence. He is related with his absurd world of muddling events. And since this world makes no sense, he finds no universal principles in it nor any moral standards. Upon his realization, he encounters his dreadful freedom because, as Sartre affirms, man’s freedom is absolute and radical. It implies that man is completely free and his freedom is far-reaching.&lt;/p&gt;"
10.1515/auk-2012-0105,Reconstruction in Moral Philosophy?,"AbstractWe raise throe issues for Kitcher’s Ethical Project: First, we argue that the genealogy of morals starts well before the advent of altruism-failures and the need to remedy them, which Kitcher dates at about 50K years ago. Second, we challenge the likelihood of long term moral progress of the sort Kitcher requires to establish objectivity while circumventing Hume's challenge to avoid trying to derive normative conclusions from positive ones ‘ought’ from ‘is’. Third, we sketch ways in which Kitcher’s mctacthical opponents could respond to his arguments against them."

In meiner Kritik an Clark lege ich dar, dass Nietzsches positive Erwähnungen der Wissenschaft in diesen Texten nicht bedeuten, dass er für die modernen empirischen Wissenschaften ein- tritt. Die Prüfung seiner Argumente in GM und AC ergibt vielmehr, dass er zeigen wollte, dass die moderne Wissenschaft sich aus einem alternativen genealogischen Strang des Asketismus entwickelte und eine Rückkehr zu einer,positiven* Auffassung der Wissenschaft erst wieder möglich würde, wenn man die Bindung des modernen Empirizismus an die asketische Tradition in Frage gestellt habe. Indem er den Geist der antiken,Wissenschaft* neu für sich zurückgewann, fand Nietzsche eine Basis, um die ideologischen Fundamente der modernen Wissenschaft anzugreifen."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199941339.013.39,Philosophy of Technology and the Environment,"Four strands of research in the philosophy of technology have made important contributions to environmental philosophy. First, critical theory of technology emphasizes the environmentally exploitative tendencies of capitalist technological innovation. Second, phenomenologyhas examined how technologies shapeperception and orientation to the world with implications for our treatment of and regard for nature. Third, concurrent with the environmental movement itself, an empirical turn in philosophy of technology resulting in philosophers focusing their attention on particular tools and techniques. Empirical studies have emphasized environmentally significant technologies. Finally, work inspired by philosophy of science has adopted scientific reasoning and methods in environmental policy with tools such as risk analysis and environmental impact assessment. These four strands of work have often merged with the work of sociologists, geographers, and political theorists interested in the connections between science and democracy."
10.28945/3039,Evolution of the Philosophy of Investments in IT Projects,"This paper discusses the changes in Information Technology (IT) investment philosophy of both private and public sector companies. Based on the available published material in scholarly journals and magazines, our analysis is focused on the USA and the UK. The paper analyzes the past and current behaviors of business investments in technology and the factors that have prompted companies to change their IT investment patterns. The paper discusses how the success of IT can not be measured with traditional methods of calculating return on investments (ROI) but must be evaluated in other ways. It highlights specific points proving that IT has slowly evolved over the years from an uncontrollable technological change to a strategic management tool that creates and increases competitiveness. In this strategic role, investment in IT has become a tool of meeting business objectives for the companies."
10.28945/3155,Know Your Discipline: Teaching the Philosophy of Computer Science,"The diversity and interdisciplinarity of computer science and the multiplicity of its uses in other sciences make it hard to define computer science and to prescribe how computer science should be carried out. The diversity of computer science also causes friction between computer scientists from different branches. Computer science curricula, as they stand, have been criticized for being unable to offer computer scientists proper methodological training or a deep understanding of different research traditions. At the Department of Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Joensuu we decided to include in our curriculum a course that offers our students an awareness of epistemological and methodological issues in computer science, and we wanted to design the course to be meaningful for practicing computer scientists. In this article the needs and aims of our course on the philosophy of computer science are discussed, and the structure and arrangements—the whys, whats, and hows—of that course are explained. The course, which is given entirely on-line, was designed for advanced graduate or postgraduate computer science students from two Finnish universities: the University of Joensuu and the University of Kuopio. The course has four relatively broad themes, and all those themes are tied to the students’ everyday work or their own research topics. I have prepared course readings about each of those four themes. The course readings describe, in a compact and simple form, the cruces of the topics that are discussed in the course. The electronic version of the course readings includes hyperlinks to a large number of articles that are available on-line. The course readings are publicly available on the course home page, and they are licensed under the creative commons license."

The sample of the study consists of 45 primary school boy students who were randomly selected using multistage random cluster sampling from among 19 districts of Education. This is a Quasi-experimental method research with experimental and control groups. Research tool in this study was Achenbach questionnaire form YSR (Youth Self-report). At first, using this questionnaire, all third and forth graders in two schools were selected by screening in which 45 ones got a score which showed psychosomatic disorders that all of them were eager to take part in the study. The test group, during a 12 sessions in a week, for 1 hour, participated in community of philosophical inquiry-the method of “Philosophy for Children” Program-with a training coach. After the end of the sessions, Achenbach’s re-test, on both control and test groups, was taken to determine the effect of holding the “Philosophy for Children” Program on psychosomatic disorders. The results of this study showed that the implementation of this program has a significant effect in reducing symptoms of psychosomatic disorder of test group."

Reality does not change by changing the process rather attributable quality named from A to B or This to that but essence remains the same. Process in metaphysics has two inseparable parts according to philosophers, cause and effect, which in any case intrinsic to every event coming into being. Denying either one makes impossibility of event. Once cause with all necessary condition fulfilled, cannot delay its effect by necessity, which is the sole premise with philosophers to assume worlds pre-eternity. On the contrary, according to Islamic theologians, it is not necessary and condition for event to have causal connection and it is possible to delay effect in presence of cause also and this is possible in conventional as well as rational and reasoning level. The central issue rose by Imam Al-Gazali (rahmatullahali) in his `Tahafut Al-falasifa concerning the world’s pre-eternity rotate around the cause and effect. He showed the incoherence of arguments posed by philosophers and proposed that it’s possible to delay the effect. Now, after 800 years, creation already unveiled mysteries in the form, which both the parties (Philosophers and theologians) did not know. However, who won the debate over world’s pre-eternity is still open. This paper will try to fill that gap by attempting direct discussion of Tahafut Al-falasifa on the issue of world pre-eternity, considering cause and effect as central debate and will show that what Imam Al-Gazali (rahmatullahali) proposed was correct: The delay in effect with cause is possible. This will be a contribution to the Islamic theology collecting physical facts from science, which anyhow reached to the same level where it meets metaphysics. This will be the latest debate on the issue, and provide new insights on some of core results of scientific theories, which are not considered yet.&lt;/p&gt;"

Ao longo das ultimas décadas tornou-se bastante usual as empresas declararem publicamente sua Filosofia Institucional, enunciando missão, visão, credos, princípios e valores como resultado da implantação de sistemas de qualidade, especialmente com o advento da internet e da criação dos sites oficiais das instituições. No entanto, apesar da grande visibilidade atual, percebe-se que nem sempre a Filosofia Institucional tem sido perfeitamente compreendida em todo seu potencial ideológico. Em inúmeros casos esses elementos estão escritos, mas não comunicam um sentido que alegra, que motiva. É um conjunto de valores que não dão incremento de vida e criatividade às pessoas no trabalho.

Using the qualitative data from Hahnemann’s works with special reference to his Organon we found that Hahnemann’s principles are, unquestionably, a philosophical system in its own right. The primary goal of his philosophy, however is not solely speculative, indeed it is a medical philosophy written in brief  aphoristic style, aimed more of guidelines at curing suffering human beings, rather than winning adherents to its speculative creed. The main concern of  Hahnemann with regard to his medical philosophy is actually the question of suffering human well-being. The answer to this question will provide an indication of the relevant of  Hahnemannian principles to anthropology of transcendent philosophy. Thus Hahnemann’s principles cannot be properly understood apart from some grasp of  his conception of human nature and philosophy as a whole. Nonetheless his ideas are against the new emergence mainstream thought pattern of modern Europe which in turn spread all over the globe."

First is the binary oppositional structure, which has two kinds of variations : hierarchical and non-hierarchical. Second is the threefold structure which has three kinds of variations, the hierarchical, the non-hierarchical and the triangle, third is the ﬁvefold structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those structures are neither material nor spiritual. They are above the material, the behavioral, as well as the spiritual phenomena, but they are manifested, expressed in material, behavioral and spiritual phenomena. They are thus the transcendental structures in Islam. Are those structures universal ? Can we ﬁnd them in other religions? To answer these questions we need to analyze data from other religions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
10.20871/kpjipm.v1i2.18,Confronting The Threat of Relativism : Views from Islamic Philosophy,"Today the issue of ethics and most importantly moral values are being seen as merely based upon opinions and emotions. This has led towards a relativisation of moral values and thus towards the erosion of values amongst societies. This paper would analyze and suggest ways of  preserving values for the structuring of developmental ideas for thinkers in developing countries. Coming from an Islamic standpoint the ideas of virtues have to be rooted within the transcendent or the Absolute. Such defense of virtues are deﬁnitely beyond the grasp of usual western philosophy as the philosophy that is propagated by Islam is not a mere intellectual exercise but a transformative exercise which connects the profane to the sacred, the outer to the inner and the physical world to the spiritual world. The loci or the focus point is the human being thus developing the idea of being human via the inculcation of and preservation of virtues is of utmost importance. The virtues most important in Islam such as justice, moderation or temperance have been discussed by various muslim philosophers. These virtues are rooted in the Absolute and through His presence in the various levels of existences are they known. For Using ideas from malay cosmology and soteriology based upon the writings of Malay scholars, this paper would highlight ways to preserve and ensure Malay society does not fall under the threat of relativism of moral values."
10.18438/b81g7j,Alignment of Citation Behaviors of Philosophy Graduate Students and Faculty,"Objective – This study analyzes sources cited by graduate students in philosophy at the University of Colorado Boulder (UCB) in 55 PhD dissertations and master’s theses submitted between 2005 and 2010, to discover their language, age, format, discipline, whether or not they were held by the library, and how they were acquired. Results were compared to data previously collected about sources cited by philosophy faculty at UCB, in books published between 2004 and 2009, to identify how closely citation behaviors aligned between the two groups.&#x0D;
&#x0D;
Methods – Citations were counted in the PhD dissertations and master’s theses. Citations to monographs were searched against the local catalog to determine ownership and call number. Comparison numbers for faculty research were collected from a previous study. Results were grouped according to academic rank and analyzed by format, language, age, call number, ownership, and method of purchase.&#x0D;
&#x0D;
Results – Graduate students cited mostly books, though fewer than commonly found in other studies. Citations were almost entirely of English language sources. Master’s students cited slightly newer materials than doctoral students, who in turn cited newer materials than faculty. The library owned most cited books, and most of those were purchased on an approval plan. Doctoral students most frequently cited resources outside the discipline of philosophy, in contrast to master’s students and faculty.&#x0D;
&#x0D;
Conclusions – The citation behavior of graduate students in philosophy largely, but not entirely, mirrors that of the faculty. Further study of citation behavior in humanities disciplines would be useful. Understanding the behavior of philosophers can help philosophy librarians make informed choices about how to spend library funds."

development, information of the social relations, the relevance of technological skills and applied knowledge among&#x0D;
the younger generation. We studied the relation of philosophical knowledge to the needs and value orientations of&#x0D;
the modern generation. The authors study the main myths of social consciousness of generation Y: lazy, need to&#x0D;
serve instantly the needs, malevolence toward others, selfishness and spoiled. For the analysis of values of modern&#x0D;
generation there was used the concept of an American coach-coach B. Hobart about the generation Y. There are&#x0D;
the results of regional studies on issues of vital resources of modern man. There is updated the main problem of&#x0D;
the young generation – the problem of shortage of vital resources, which are expressed in three dimensions: lack&#x0D;
of knowledge, lack of communication and lack of time. The authors analyze the core values of generation Y – the&#x0D;
resource knowledge and the resource of freedom of personal choice. Taking into account the transformation of the&#x0D;
needs of the students they describe technology lectures on philosophy. They present such contemporary methods of&#x0D;
training as brainstorming, method and method criteria. There is an example of the structure and key concepts of the&#x0D;
lecture to University students on the topic “Consciousness as a philosophical category”. As necessary components of&#x0D;
philosophy education, the authors today highlight the practical orientation, the technological component of practical&#x0D;
training, as well as the increasing demands for the preparation of the contemporary teacher in philosophy."

This study aimed to examine the existing situation of educational administration thus developed guidelines based on Sufficiency Economy Philosophy in the five educational extended schools under the Office of Khon Kaen Primary Education Service Area 4. Researchers utilized qualitative method multi-cases design. This study was carried out in two phases involving document analysis, interview and observation to examine the situation of educational administration followed by focus group discussion to develop guidelines. Data was analyzed using content analysis and presented it in descriptive manner. Results from the first phase of the study indicated that stakeholders are meeting together to set the vision and mission which integrated the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy in every administrative aspect in terms of policy. In addition, all the five research schools were implementing the specified mission and vision as they planned. Furthermore, stakeholders participated in planning for academic development and Sufficiency Economy Philosophy was integrated in school curriculum specifically in academic aspect. Improvement in the plan for the following year was conducted through evaluation. The second phase of the findings regarding the guidelines for educational administrators as such administrators and stakeholders should participate in setting policy based on the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy and implement it in school administrative management. Meanwhile the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy should be integrated in school curriculum by having stakeholders worked out the plan for academic development. The implementation of plans should be based on the concepts of saving, worthiness, and optimal outcomes. Finally environmental factors were needed for Sufficiency Economy Philosophy instruction.&#x0D;

Thus Royce and Dewey explored the nature of genuine community and its role in developing a flourishing individual life but also a public, democratic life. Royce and James engaged in a phenomenological analysis of human experience including religious experience developing a rich understanding of human psychological, social, and religious development. Dewey, Royce and Perice applied the lessons of the scientific communal experience to problem solving in everyday life. Dewey explored life’s aesthetic dimensions. Addams, Du Bois and Locke applied philosophy to problems of living with discrimination as an immigrant or an African American."

Se concluye que el tema de la innovación responde a los criterios para categorizar la cientificidad, encontrándose que esto tiene implicaciones en el campo de los estudios sobre el tema en aspectos como: la construcción / transmisión del conocimiento, la evasión del ""sentido común"", y el uso del ""método"" como recurso para construir el conocimiento científico."
10.18061/dsq.v33i4.3869,"On the Negative Possibility of Suffering: Adorno, Feminist Philosophy, and the Transfigured Crip To Come","&lt;p&gt;Critical theorist Theodor Adorno is rarely considered as a philosopher of the body. The body which leaks, desires, rages, and lusts is seemingly disjointed from the dry and dense writings that often characterize Adorno's work. As bleak as this description of Adorno&amp;rsquo;s writings may be, however, the body is both central to his critique of modernity and the site of hope and desire against the total domination and suffering that capitalism imposes. This paper highlights some of the ways in which feminist philosophy of disability and disability studies, more generally, would benefit by thinking in constellation with Adorno's negative dialectic to interrogate the ways in which meanings get made about bodies and, furthermore, use the margins of difference, in relation with others, to challenge what Adorno calls the ""wrong state of things."" I argue that the transfigured crip to come is central to this fight against the ""wrong state of things.""&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""Body""&gt;Keywords: Adorno; negative dialectics; suffering; disability; crip&lt;/p&gt;"

In the history of Western philosophy, disability has often functioned as a metaphor for something that has gone awry. This trope, according to which disability is something that has gone wrong, is amply criticized within Disability Studies, though not within the tradition of philosophy itself or even within feminist philosophy. In this paper, I use one instance of this disability metaphor, contained within a passage from Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Philosophy of Right&lt;/em&gt;, in order to show that paying attention to disability and disability theory can enable identification of ableist assumptions within the tradition of philosophy and can also open up new interpretations of canonical texts. On my reading, whereas Hegel&amp;rsquo;s expressed views of disability are dismissive, his logic and its treatment of contingency offer up useful ways to situate and re-evaluate disability as part of the concept of humanity. Disability can in fact be useful to Hegel, especially in the context of his valorization of experiences of disruption and disorientation. Broadening our understanding of the possible ways that the philosophical tradition has conceived human beings allows us to better draw on its theoretical resources.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""NoSpacing""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""NoSpacing""&gt;&lt;span lang=""EN-CA""&gt;Keywords: Hegel; contingency; history of philosophy; feminist Hegel scholarship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""NoSpacing""&gt;&lt;span lang=""EN-CA""&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
10.7146/rom.v3i1.23254,Inger Christensen / Novalis / Philosophy of Nature,"The Danish poet and essayist Inger Christensen (1935–2009) has been labelled a modernist, a postmodernist, an experimentalist, and an exponent of systematic poetry. However, all through her works runs her preoccupation with early German romanticism, the philosophical and poetological writings of Novalis in particular. Christensen’s complex relationship with Novalis has so far received little scholarly attention. The aim of this tripartite article is to fill this lacuna by shedding light on the various ways in which Christensen engages with Novalis and renegotiates his romantic heritage. Central to Christensen’s poetics is a concept derived from Novalis: hemmelighedstilstanden [the state of secrecy]. Reading this concept in conjunction with the contemporary German-Austrian poet Peter Waterhouse’s corresponding concept of Geheimnislosigkeit [literally: secretlessness], Silje Ingeborg Harr Svare explores Christensen’s renegotiation of Novalis’s philosophy of subjectivity and language. Anne Gry Haugland addresses the complex and radical philosophy of nature that resonates throughout Christensen’s works. While this philosophy of nature is indebted to German romantic Naturphilosophie, it is also informed by recent developments in the natural sciences: drawing on concepts in contemporary science such as biosemiotics, scalar ratios, and self-organizing systems – Haugland outlines the scientific context for Christensen’s philosophy of nature. Finally, Klaus Müller Wille explores the relationship between Christensen’s long poem det [It] and Novalis’s unfinished philosophical novel Die Lehrlinge zu Sais [The disciples of Sais], showing that det is informed by Novalis’s fragment on a structural, a diegetic, a rhetorical, and a conceptual level."
10.20321/nilejes.v1i1.34,The Philosophy of Being and Practical Criticism: The Prime Minister’s Son and Secrets,"The Philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, is regarded as the great pessimist of philosophy. It is in his philosophy that one can locate Greg Mbajiorgu’s and Nuruddin Farah’s The Prime Minister’s Son and Secrets respectively. Arthur Schopenhauer’s philosophy was a reaction to both Kantian and Hegelian Philosophies. The objective of this essay was to see where Greg Mbajiorgu’s The Prime Minister’s Son and Nuruddin Farah’s Secrets complied with Schopenhauer’s idea of the absurd, which the world is. The questions the essay tried to answer are: Why is there so much suffering in the world? Why did the characters such as Ezinma and her son have to endure so much suffering in The Prime Minister’s Son? Why did Damac have to be gang-raped in Secrets? Why do we hold secrets? Why are there taboos, which humans will so willingly not adhere to in their privacy? The paper sought answers to these questions in the two texts under study using qualitative method. Quantitative data in the form of interview published in a book was also used to support both the deductive and inductive analysis of texts. The importance of this research paper cannot be overemphasized when one considers the suffering that most humankind experience in the process of living. It is expected to provide enlightenment to Governments of the world, especially in developing countries on the need to reducing the suffering that many in these countries face."

In the first place, it is a sign that the field is flourishing. Indeed, there are now so many who pursue this kind of inquiry, and those hail from such far-flung locales, that hardly any single scholar is acquainted with all of his fellows or even with all of their research. Names of new scholars, announcements of long forgotten manuscripts, and novel interpretations of well-known works spring forth at each learned conference as well as in each issue of scholarly journals. What is more, it is a sign of the extent to which the field of Arabic studies in general has now become populous and diversified. No longer can an individual scholar aspire to keep up with all of the research being pursued in all of the various sub-disciplines of the field. Finally, it is a sign that even in the midst of such burgeoning activity and specialization there is an abiding interest in the field as a whole. It is the latter, above all, that warrants this general account of what is happening with respect to the study of Arabic philosophy."
10.1017/s0026318400013195,The Study of Arabic Philosophy Today,"In recent years, scholarship concerning Abū Hāmid al-Ghazālī (450/1058–505/1111) has been directed more to the exploration of his thought than to editing or translating his vast corpus. This is not to say that there have been no editions or translations. Sulaymān Dunyā continues to publish versions of various treatises in which he replaces a critical apparatus with the explanation that he has already consulted the relevant manuscripts and selected the readings he deems sound or in which his critical apparatus consists of notes indicating that a particular word is differently rendered in some of the “sources” (uṣūl). However, other equally non-academic mass-market printings of al-Ghazali’s works apart, only a few critically edited texts have been published in the last two decades. Three years after the appearance of his al-Ghazālī bibliography, a volume that appeared as part of the millenary celebration of Abū Ḥāmid’s birth, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Badawī published a critical edition of Faḍā’iḥ al-Bāṭinīyah. In the same year, Abū al-ʿAlā ʿAfīfī’s edition of Mishkāt al-Anwār appeared, and a year later A. L. Tibawi published his edition and translation of the small “Jerusalem Treatise” (al-Risālah al-Qudsīyah). In 1971, Fadlou A. Shehadi’s edition of The Supreme Purpose (al-Maqṣad al-Asnā) was published."

He was a scientist and philosopher, but at his core he was a physician. His foray into the field of psychiatry can be directly traced to his patients, particularly a girl who became ill while she was nursing her sick father. Breuer and Freud called the girl Anna O. in their book on hysteria, but later it was revealed that her name was Bertha Pappenheim. Breuer first told Freud about Pappenheim in November 1882 approximately 5 months after he stopped treating her. It would be more than a decade, however, before they published her case history. Breuer and Freud collaborated on numerous clinical cases, but Breuer did not write any further on psychoanalysis. Breuer did maintain an active interest in the function of the inner ear until his death in 1925."

It begins with a brief sketch of the post-Hegelian crisis before drawing on the work of several protagonists (Wilhelm Wundt, Emil Kraepelin, and Theodor Ziehen) to explore how that crisis influenced psychiatry, and then how they interpreted the relationship between psychiatry and philosophy, discussing some of the exchanges that transpired across the disciplinary threshold, and illustrating how these exchanges shaped the development of psychiatry. Specifically, it argues that much of Kraepelin’s early research encountered a well-entrenched, antimetaphysical bias within his profession, and how he (among many others) drew on experimental methods developed in the neighboring fields of philosophy and psychology in order to introduce new psychological dimensions into the overwhelmingly neuropsychiatric research paradigms of his day. Although remembered mainly for his contributions to the history of so-called biological psychiatry, Kraepelin’s career and research were initially inspired by the methods and promise of early Wundtian experimental psychology."

Seeking an understanding of the dissociative underpinnings of medical practice, the chapter turns to the Western philosophical lineage, with particular emphasis on mind–body dualism. Beginning with Plato, key passages in The Republic and The Symposium are examined, exploring Plato’s influential conception of the hierarchy between the physical and intelligible realms. Descartes’ Enlightenment philosophy and his approach to knowledge—with thought abstracted from the physical realm—is discussed in detail, alongside the connections between such thought and medical practice. The chapter closes with a question, to be addressed in Part II: Might philosophy offer more salutary approaches to understanding healthcare?"

If we have an algebraic cycle Z on X, taking spreads yields a cycle Ƶ on X. Applying Hodge theory to Ƶ on X gives invariants of the cycle. Another related situation is algebraic K-theory. For example, to study Kₚsuperscript Milnor(k), the geometry of S can be used to construct invariants."

(Important sources documenting racism and sexism in psychiatry are cited.) Analysis shows that theoretical perspective is one of the most important factors in play in working toward the goal of eliminating racism and sexism from psychiatry. To this end, four types of theoretical frameworks are considered: naturalism, social constructionism, relativism and antirelativism, and phenomenology. Also considered are efforts to show the compatibility of two different frameworks. Each framework is explored and critiqued regarding its potential to expose and correct racist and sexist attitudes that are incorporated into research and treatment in psychiatry. Included are discussions of the relevance of realism and antirealism in evaluating theoretical frameworks, as well as evaluation of theoretical claims regarding the roles of biology, genetics, the medical model, and culture in either sustaining or counteracting racism and sexism in psychiatry, including psychoanalysis. Finally, Husserlian phenomenology is suggested as a philosophical framework for psychiatry that can transcend the limitations of the other frameworks discussed. Phenomenology enables psychiatry, including psychology and psychoanalysis, to constitute itself as a science that transcends both constructionist relativism and naturalistic reductionism."

From a complementary perspective, the study of autism may challenge our ways of thinking about the mind itself. For example, are we justified in introducing divisions among cognition, conation, and affect in characterizing early development? What is the epistemological basis for children's understanding of others' minds? How should we think about the origins of and basis for symbolic functioning? This chapter explores the relevance of philosophy for our accounts of autism, highlighting the importance of ideas from Wittgenstein and Strawson in particular, and illustrates fresh ways in which autism might contribute to debates in philosophy of mind."

The chapter starts by distinguishing between strong and minimal ways to understand the medical model before it moves on to talk about explanation. The basic idea of the chapter is that the logic of the medical model, together with recent developments in the sciences of the brain, suggests that psychiatry should be seen as a kind of cognitive neuroscience. The second part of the chapter discusses some issues in applying mechanistic explanatory models to mental disorders. Recent philosophical work on explanation in the cognitive neurosciences has seen it asmechanisticexplanation. A mechanistic explanation shows how components of a system interact to give rise to the phenomenon to be explained."

And more seriously, servility in the personality of Chinese people is a severe weakness rooted in the traditional morals of China which was criticised by Chinese scholars fierecely, and this major defect of Chinese personality is the huge obstacle of the development of modern Chinese thought. To eliminate all the weakness of Chinese traditional morality and to renew the personality of Chinese, we could learn from the essence of Nietzsche’s theories of “superman morality” which advocated the independent and self-esteem strongly, thus create an independent personality for Chinese which urges people to be free, self-esteem, creative, courageous and with healthy psychology. &lt;/p&gt;"

By 1815, the “Historical and Literary Committee of the American Philosophical Society” would declare this “native language” a uniquely “American idiom” to be discovered on the American continent through the “numerous novel forms” of Indian languages. In his early novels, James Fenimore Cooper seized upon the aesthetic value that could be constructed from Indian languages and from the figure of the noble savage. I show how Cooper’s novels build upon beliefs in the prelapsarian quality of indigenous languages. I argue that the regenerative potential that Cooper’s novels portray as arising from Indian words functions as aesthetic compensation for the violence and repeated violation of treaty agreements that characterized US and Indian relations in the early nineteenth century."

Alston. In this chapter, the author engages Alston’s proposals, and argues that even a robust notion of intentional action predicated of God yields very little when it comes to understanding claims about divine action that are of prime importance to the Christian tradition. The author also begins to query the concept of God as an acting agent. The author also indicates again how most philosophers commit themselves to a thin version of a doctrinal tradition even without explicitly stating it, and that the debate about divine action is better served by thick engagement with the Christian doctrinal tradition."

M. Crombie. The author contends that Crombie provided an elegant way of naming two critical questions about divine action; but he failed to develop a satisfactory answer to either of them. The problems he discussed quickly became the site of a concerted attack on the whole idea of divine action. The author shows that this attack fails, even as it prompted theologians to resort to paradox to keep divine action afloat as a serious option for theology."

O Homem Absurdo na filosofia camusiana e na poesia drummondiana: a linguagem como fonte da (trans)formação&#x0D;
&#x0D;
Este artigo busca aproximações entre a poesia de Carlos Drummond de Andrade, em Sentimento do Mundo (1940), e a filosofia de Albert Camus, em O mito de Sísifo – a obra de arte como aventura de um destino espiritual (2012), para, por meio da linguagem praticada por Drummond em dois poemas – Poema da necessidade e Mãos dadas –, pensar o estar no mundo e a passagem do homem da condição de ser ôntico para ser ontológico, valendo-se, também, de Durand (2012) e de outros teóricos. Utiliza, como metodologia, a pesquisa bibliográfica e expressa teorias do texto poético, conceitos e análises com base na crítica fenomenológica. Ainda, numa atitude interdisciplinar, para refletir sobre o sujeito e sua constituição como discurso, baseia-se nas teorias da Análise de Discurso de linha francesa (AD) e de linha anglo-saxã (ADC), cujos principais expoentes são, respectivamente, Michel Pêcheux e Norman Fairclough, apoiando-se na concepção do materialismo dialético."
10.1017/s0424208400002400,"Philosophy, Hagiology and the Early Byzantine Origins of Purgatory","On 8 June 1438, the Council of Ferrara-Florence began proceedings aimed at the reunion of the Eastern and Western Churches. One of the first issues discussed was the Latin doctrine of purgatory. This article examines a particular moment in the divergence of eschatological doctrine between the Latin, Greek and Syriac Churches – indeed, representatives of the West Syrian ‘Jacobites’ and East Syrian ‘Nestorians’ were at Ferrara too. It argues that a debate concerning the post mortem activity of the saints proved crucial for the formation of various Christian eschatological orthodoxies. The catalyst for this debate was the sixth-century revival of Aristotelian philosophy, especially Aristotelian psychology which emphasized the soul’s dependence on the body. This threatened the cult of the saints and the Church’s sacramental ‘care of the dead’. Defenders of the hagiological and cultic status quo rejected Aristotle’s claims and asserted the full post mortem activity of the soul after separation from the body by developing a novel doctrine of immediate post mortem judgement. This led to the formulation of eschatological opinions which, if not normative in their day, came to be considered so by later generations. One of these ideas was post mortem purgation."

But this specialised topic may partly explain what was in fact the official attitude of the Byzantine Church, of its patriarchs, bishops and monks, over the centuries, towards Greek philosophy and science. May I suggest that Greek philosophy and science were, and still are indeed, one of the component factors and inspirations of our renaissance and post-renaissance western civilisation?

10.11649/ch.2017.006,Radomir Konstantinović and “Provincial Philosophy”: Binaries as Borders,"Radomir Konstantinović and Provincial Philosophy: Binaries as BordersThis essay is a partial reconsideration of the complex and often-cited work Filozofije palanke (1969) by the Serbian novelist and essayist Radomir Konstantinović. The fiery condemnations of Serbia’s stalled social and intellectual development and its accompanying predilection for barbaric violence are fiercely debated to this day, nearly six years after the death of the author and approaching fifty years since the book’s first publication. One way that Konstantinovic builds his argument is by establishing borders between Serbia, or other societies, and Europe or modernity; three main types of these borders can be expressed as binaries centered on values, time, and geography. The “spirit” or mindset of the palanka, or small Serbian town, can perhaps be rehabilited by converting it into a historically contingent philosophy, which comes to term with the forces of time, evolution, and agency. Radomir Konstantinović i filozofia prowincjalna. Przeciwstawności jako graniceEsej jest cząstkowym spojrzeniem na złożoną i często cytowaną pracę Filozofije palanke (1969) napisaną przez serbskiego powieściopisarza i eseistę Radomira Konstantinovicia. Ostra krytyka opóźnionego rozwoju społecznego i intelektualnego Serbii oraz towarzyszącego mu upodobania do barbarzyńskiej przemocy także dziś – prawie sześć lat po śmierci autora, i prawie pięćdziesiąt lat od pierwszego wydania książki, stanowią temat dyskusji. Jednym ze sposobów, w jaki Konstantinović buduje swoją argumentację, jest ustanowienie granicy między Serbią a innymi społeczeństwami, czy Europą i nowoczesnością. Trzy główne typy tych granic można wyrazić jako przeciwstawności skoncentrowane na wartościach, czasie i geografii. „Duch” lub sposób myślenia palanki, czyli serbskiego pipidówka, może zostać zrehabilitowany poprzez przekształcenie go w historycznie reprezentatywną filozofię, która mierzy się z siłami czasu, ewolucji i działań."
10.21814/unio.1.4,Contributions from Neuroscience and Biology to the Philosophy of Law,"This article discusses the possibility of dealing, from a scientific point of view, with ethical standards from which one can critically evaluate positive law. For a long time it was considered that such standards would be subjective, emotional, and that they would vary according to time and place. That is why it was considered impossible, especially from a positivist point of view, to examine them using a scientific approach, due to a lack of the necessary objectivity. The findings of contemporary biology and neuroscience, however, may cast new light on this debate. Although they would not resolve the debate, these findings significantly challenge the idea that moral sentiments cannot be able to be scientifically studied."
10.1515/wps-2017-0010,"Justice, Gender, and Corporations. Outline of a Feminist Political Philosophy of the Corporation","AbstractCorporations, as institutions that participate in the creation and perpetuation of gender-based injustices, have been neglected by feminist political philosophers and egalitarians in general. However, since gender-based inequalities within the family, the market, and in democratic participation are interconnected, critically scrutinizing institutions such as corporate organizations appears to be essential in order to achieve gender justice. This is our goal in this paper. In the first part, we look at the (surprising) domination of the ethics of care in the feminist literature on corporations. Since it focuses essentially on the goal of developing virtuous managers, we conclude that this ethics of care is misleading when it comes to thinking about the kinds of relations that characterize corporations and their much needed organizational transformation. In the second part, we attempt to highlight and articulate more explicitly the need for a critical analysis of corporations from the point of view of gender justice. Finally, having shown how purely “distributive” approaches of gender justice are unsatisfactory, we finish by outlining a multidimensional approach to gender (in)justice"
10.18740/s4sk5r,Philosophy at the Service of History: Marx and the need for critical philosophy today,"Marx is famous for apparently dismissing the practical role of philosophy. Yet, as accumulating empirical knowledge of growing life-crises proves, the simply availability of facts is insufficient to motivate struggles for fundamental change. So too manifest social crisis. The economic crisis which began in 2008 has indeed motivated social struggles, but nothing on the order of the revolutionary struggles Marx expected. Rather than make Marx irrelevant, however, the absence of global struggles for truly radical change make his early engagement with the role of philosophy more important than ever. This engagement suggests a conception of philosophy as a uniquely practical discipline distinguished from empirical science by its unique capacity to synthesise values from the facts of life. The article examines the development of this conception of philosophy in Marx’s early work and concludes with the outlines for a new critical philosophy capable of generating a new set of universal values necessary to motivate anti-capitalist struggles today. Si Hegel a raison et que la philosophie émerge toujours dans un monde social dans lequel les contradictions se sont fossilisées, où le pouvoir d'unification semble avoir disparu, alors notre monde est un monde qui a besoin de la philosophie. L’automne 2008 a été témoin du début d'une crise économique qui promet d’être la pire de sa génération. La crise économique est liée à une crise politique de la démocratie sur le long terme (même si la crise n’est pas typiquement reconnue comme telle), caractérisée à travers le monde par un retrait de la régulation de l’activité économique par l’Etat et (sous le prétexte de la ‘guerre contre le terrorisme’) l’hyperrégulation des vies publiques et privées des citoyens. Les crises économiques et politiques sont toutes deux enserrées dans une profonde crise environnementale provoquée par la croissance hypertrophiée de l’économie capitaliste dirigée par l’argent-comme-valeur. Si cette valeur est en crise parce qu’elle ne peut plus ‘unifier’ le monde social (elle est maintenant la cause et non pas la solution des problèmes fondamentaux de la vie humaine) alors la philosophie, si Hegel a raison, devrait être conviée en tant qu'unique pratique intellectuelle capable de générer une nouvelle synthèse sur la base des nouvelles valeurs (ou au moins une nouvelle articulation des anciennes valeurs)."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199731596.013.017,Rhetoric and Stoic Philosophy,"This chapter discusses the conflict between the aims of rhetoric and those of Stoic philosophy in the Roman context. While rhetoric aimed at persuasion, the Stoics felt that philosophical teachings demanded a language stripped of ornament. Where rhetoric sought to move, the Stoic sought to teach without appeal to the emotions. The hopelessness of following Stoic strictures in the courtroom is illustrated by Cicero’s account of Rutilius Rufus. However, later Roman Stoics were willing to employ metaphor as well as clarity as a pedagogical tool, and their interest in the dialogue form and in epistolary exchange as modes of arriving at Stoic conclusions could itself be seen as a modification of the Hellenistic Stoic use of dialectic."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195335828.013.009,"Representation, Misrepresentation, and Error in Spinoza’s Philosophy of Mind","Spinoza seems to commit himself to two implausible doctrines about representation: (i) that no idea can represent what is not the case and (ii) that every idea of imagination represents a truly vast amount of what is or has been the case. This essay examines the roles of confusion and causation in Spinoza’s theory of imaginative representation. In doing so, it uncovers a promising way in which he could use his distinctive conatus doctrine—that “each thing, insofar as it is in itself, strives to persevere in its being” (E3p6)—both to constrain the otherwise vast extent of the imaginative representation of what is and to explain how imaginative misrepresentation is possible."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195335828.013.002,Spinoza’s Philosophy of Religion,"This chapter proposes a new interpretation of Spinoza’s approach to religion. The main thesis is that Spinoza is primarily concerned with a philosophical reinterpretation of Christ and Christianity. His celebrated critique of religion, by contrast, is a secondary project. It is not necessary to attain the goals of TTP, accounts for some of the main flaws in TTP’s argument and quite possibly was not part of TTP’s original plan. This chapter first shows that, in the writings prior to TTP, Spinoza consistently claims that the true content of Biblical religion agrees with the doctrines demonstrated in philosophy while the literal content of Biblical religion ensures that imperfectly rational citizens follow the prescriptions of reason. Then it gives an account of the philosophical interpretation of Christianity set forth along the same lines in his later writings. Finally, it discusses Spinoza’s critique of religion and proposes an explanation for why he chose to undermine his philosophical interpretation of Christianity."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195335828.013.016,Spinoza’s Political Philosophy,"This article argues that Spinoza is a modern republican political philosopher. He combines Machiavelli’s idea of liberty with Hobbes’s version of the social contract. This claim has four basic elements. First, Spinoza rejects Hobbes’s view that the individual must alienate his natural rights to form a state through a contract. Rather, the contract’s validity depends on a continuous and dynamic transfer of power from its citizens, which is defined as participation in public life. Second, the stability of a state depends on how effectively the regime can foster participation in the state. Spinoza uses his theory of the imagination and passions to explain how the state can overcome free-rider problems in the social contract. Hence the republican ideal of government is expressed not so much in any particular constitutional form of the state but in how well each form can foster participation. Although democracy expresses the highest degree of participation—and hence stability—aristocracy and even monarchy can be also optimized. Third, the participation of the individual in the state is not an end in itself but the means to the individual’s own freedom. So, although participation in the state is a necessary condition of individual well-being, it is certainly not sufficient to become virtuous. Fourth, the participation of individuals in the state, the quality and structure of state stability, as a well as the freedom of the state and individual, all depend on the degree of rationality manifest in both the individual and in the institutional structures of the state."

10.1017/s0009838816000148,COMPETENCE CONFLICTS BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND MEDICINE: CAELIUS AURELIANUS AND THE STOICS ON MENTAL DISEASES,"It is an established Hellenistic topos that philosophy is the ‘medicine’ of the soul, in charge of ‘healing’ the soul in the same way as medicine is in charge of healing the body. The ‘diseases’ of the soul deemed to be in need of healing are its passions, that is, its fears and desires, and the moral ‘health’ that philosophers pledge to grant their followers is freedom from passions and hence peace of mind."
10.1017/hgl.2016.5,Right and Trust in Hegel’s Philosophy of Right,"Abstract
            According to Hegel, true freedom consists not just in arbitrariness, but in the free willing of right. Right in turn is fully realised in the laws and institutions of ethical life. The ethical subject, for Hegel, is a practical subject that acts in accordance with ethical laws; yet it is also a theoretical, cognitive subject that recognizes the laws and institutions of ethical life as embodiments of right. Such recognition can be self-conscious and reflective; but it can, and indeed must, also be a felt recognition and as such it takes the form of trust. In Hegel’s view, therefore, the proper stance to adopt towards ethical institutions is that of trust; moreover, there is a distinctive freedom to be found in trust itself. Trust is appropriate, however, only when the institutions of ethical life are themselves worthy of it. Hegel is well aware that not all states and their institutions merit trust, but in his view a life without trust in institutions is a life without true freedom."

            Drawing on new empirical data, a group of experimental philosophers have argued that one of the most popular and influential forms of skepticism is much less interesting and much less worrisome than philosophers have thought. Contrary to this claim, I argue that this brand of skepticism remains as threatening as ever. My argument also reveals an important limitation of experimental philosophy and sheds light on the way professional philosophers should go about the business of doing philosophy."
10.1017/s0017816016000043,"Philosophy, Heresy, and Kabbalah's Counter-Theology","The role philosophy played in the rise of new Jewish esoteric traditions in the Middle Ages has always been a critical question for kabbalah scholarship. Many scholars have contributed to our understanding of kabbalah's relationship to Greek, Christian, and Jewish philosophy, Neoplatonic and Neo-Aristotelian traditions alike. In this article I wish to contribute to this vast scholarly discussion by enlightening some aspects of theosophical kabbalah's innovation in light of its dialogue with philosophical ideas. This dialogue is complex, and the extent of kabbalah's interaction with philosophy is difficult to evaluate. My assumption in the following is that such a dialogue is best apprehended where conflict can be detected. Consequently I will study different cases of theological conflict between theosophical and philosophical conceptions—cases of heresy, where a theological tension can be identified. These tensions will help us to evaluate the nature of the theosophical innovation in question. The framework of this article rests on the assumption that theosophical kabbalah shares with different philosophical traditions some important theological structures but also that it maintains important conceptual differences. In order to evaluate the theological tensions involved I will analyze different cases of theological heresies, both philosophical and theosophical. I hope with this analysis to clarify theosophical kabbalah in light of its theological renewal, a renewal that was not merely the result of the acceptance of or resistance to philosophical ideas but also of the emerging of what I propose to call counter-theology."

There may be too many philosophical branches, traditions, practices, and programs to admit of a single overarching aim. Here, I focus on a fairly traditional philosophical project that has recently received increasingly sophisticated articulation, especially by Frank Jackson (1998) and David Chalmers (2012). In Section 1, I present the project and suggest that it is usefully thought of as ‘total axiomatics’: the project of attempting to axiomatize the total theory of the world. In Section 2, I raise a problem for the project that I call the ‘problem of multiple axiomatizations’. I consider some initially alluring but ultimately unpromising approaches to this problem in Section 3. In Section 4, I defend a surprising approach to the problem, according to which competing axiomatizations of the total theory of the world are effectively evaluated for their aesthetic virtues."

Rousseau is called the father of modern educational theory and practice. After long experiences and struggle of life, he was become a successful writer, in the age of 38 years. At Geneva ,he had simple ,happy and pure life. He was emerged as revolutionary philosopher. His philosophy was based on a reaction against the contemporary social and political set up. He was a philosopher, writer and composer whose political philosophy influenced the France revolution and the development of liberal conservative and socialist theory. He was made important contribution to music as theorist and a composer. He was written two major books,Du contract social, principles du droit politique in April, then Emile or on education in May. The books criticized religion and were banned in France and Geneva. He was born in Geneva on June 28,1712 and  in 1778 died in Paris. He remained vagabond for a long time. His important writing are (1) progress of the art and sciences (2) the origin of inequality Among Men.(3) social contract (4) Emile or concerning education. During his life he were attempted so many occupations like private tutor, music tutor, composer secretary and dramatist. He was become a successful writer at the age of 38. His full name is Jean Jacques Rousseau. He was of dignity of man. He was naturalist. He said that “civilized man borns,lives and dies in a state of slavery”"
10.1017/s0034670516000024,Nietzsche's Political Engagements: On the Relationship between Philosophy and Politics in The Wanderer and His Shadow,"AbstractIn Nietzsche's early and late writings, he appears as an antimodern, antiliberal political revolutionary, championing the world-transformative characters of (first) Richard Wagner and (later) Zarathustra. By contrast, in the writings of his “middle period,” Nietzsche struck up a rapprochement with the modern world, and developed the ideal of a “free spirit.” Among those writings,The Wanderer and His Shadowsheds the most revealing light on the free spirit ideal. It shows that, even as Nietzsche sought to avoid some of the hazards associated with his more revolutionary writings, he continued to advocate a sharply critical engagement with political and cultural life. And it reveals what Nietzsche understood to be most challenging or problematic about the free spirit ideal—and, thereby, what later moved him away from it."
10.1017/s0034670516000085,What Is Left of the Political Philosophy Renewal?,"I read Beiner's book as the intellectual biography of someone who is both a witness and actor in the contemporary renewal of political philosophy. This is why, in the reflections that follow, I focus not on his perspicacious analyses of the various authors treated in the book, but rather on the manner in which he understands the nature of this renewal and the future of the discipline itself. My reflections are based in a fundamental agreement with the definition of philosophy defended in this work. Political philosophy is a discipline that reflects on the ends of human life in order to rank and to judge them. This is why, according to Beiner, political philosophy has the ambition to present totalizing views of human nature (14)."
10.1017/s0034670516000103,Madness and Political Philosophy: Beiner on Foucault,"Beiner's discussion of Foucault is grounded in the effort to “deconstruct” Foucault's mask “as a mere historian” (152). Beiner unpacks Foucault's Panopticon of post-Enlightenment society which, in a dynamic of power/knowledge, crafts the soul in a “regime of surveillance and discipline” that “maintains the disciplined individual in his subjection” (155, 158). Beiner forcefully contends that behind Foucault's language inDiscipline and Punishthere must be some account of the human being that would prefer to be outside of this seemingly dystopic society—one that is entitled “notto be subject to such a regime of normalization and control” (153). There is something disingenuous, Beiner claims, about Foucault's fidelity to the idea that “his intellectual enterprise [as a historian] requires him to disavow the normative power of his own theorizing” (164). I propose an interpretation that will perhaps rescue Foucault from Beiner's accusation of disingenuousness, and simultaneously establish a kinship between Beiner's lament for political philosophy and Foucault's own. The proposal is that Foucault is a madman."
10.1017/s0034670516000115,Playing Political Philosophy,"Ronald Beiner wants to have it both ways. We know this because, near the end of his book, he tells us that he is a “dualist,” someone for whom “philosophy and citizenship are defined by radically distinct purposes: the job of philosophy is to strive unconditionally for truth, and the job of citizenship is to strive for good and prudent judgment about the common purposes of civic life, and each should focus strictly on fulfilling its own appointed end without worrying too much about the other.” So there needs to be “a steady appreciation of the fundamental chasm between what we (as citizens) need in the world of practice and what we (as human beings) need from the world of theory” (224). This, however, would be abhorrent to most of the political philosophers Beiner covers. Because they are not dualists but monists; to them, theory and practice should be one."

Considering the work of Susan Stebbing, it also explores the application of analytic philosophy to critical thinking, and emphasizes the conceptual creativity that lies at the heart of fruitful analysis.

So what is analytic philosophy?,"There are various similarities and differences between the respective approaches to analytic philosophy of Frege, Russell, Moore, Wittgenstein, and Stebbing. But is there anything in common that could be taken to characterize analytic philosophy as a whole? ‘So what is analytic philosophy?’ explains that analytic philosophy is ‘analytic’ in an extra special sense because it made use of modern logic together with all the new techniques that emerged in its wake and the greater understanding of the relationship between logic and language that this generated. It looks at later analytic philosophy—ordinary language philosophy, ideal language philosophy, and scientific philosophy—before considering what is wrong and good about analytic philosophy."

The workshop integrated academic research with performances, movement workshops, film, and site-specific responses to the city, and welcomed disciplinary perspectives from a broad range of fields. In this article, the convenors Ella Parry-Davies and Eliesh S.D. reflect on the central issues and encounters foregrounded by the event, and the disciplinary or methodological implications of the project for performance philosophy. Taking as its central provocation the controversial statement: “Art in public spaces doesn’t exist anymore”, the workshop sought to address the role of embodied practice in Beirut’s precarious public sites. Insofar as philosophy can be ‘performed’, it is grounded in the particularities of its social space, an utterance shaped by its historical and geopolitical locality. As a practice of performance philosophy, then, Beirut: Bodies in Public triangulated these two forms-of-knowing with a third: the interrogation presented by the site itself - its potentialities, contingencies and challenges."

The eavesdropper is a spectator inside the fictional world who because of what he (and most frequently it is a male) learns by eavesdropping or just by carrying out this act of transgression is transformed into a victim. I exemplify with Polonius (in Hamlet, III, 4) and Orgon (in Tartuffe, IV, 5), who are physically situated in a focal (liminal) point where the eavesdroppers become vulnerable and can quickly be transformed from tragic to comic figures and vice versa, transgressing the generic borderlines between tragedy, melodrama, comedy and farce. There are also many instances where philosophical discourses originate from an eavesdropping situation, the most obvious being the form of teaching practiced by Pythagoras, lecturing to his students from behind a curtain. My article also examines examples of eavesdropping in the writings of Plato and Walter Benjamin."

Departing from Richard Bauman’s definition of performance as both communication and enactment, we will use the postulates of Graham Harman’s Object-Oriented Ontology to speculate on what performance might mean beyond the human/nonhuman divide.  Ultimately, it will be claimed, performance, understood as both enactment and unveiling, is at the core of all encounters between all bodies and irrespective of their perceived nature. As a result, the world must once again be thought as theatrum mundi, as a stage where bodies always encounter one another through the contingency of the personae they play, personae that nonetheless are unable to exhaust the full being of the bodies behind them."
10.21476/pp.2015.1123,Thinking Without Authority: Performance Philosophy <em>as</em> the Democracy of Thought,"Performance philosophy commences with an impertinent gesture when it describes itself as inaugurating a ‘new field’ of study.  Accompanying that claim is a radical proposition that ‘performance thinks’; that it should be counted as a form of philosophising in its own right.  But in what sense can performance be construed as ‘genuinely’ philosophical thought?  Taking my cue from Laura Cull’s alignment of performance philosophy with Laruelle’s practice of ‘non philosophy’ – and specifically, with its introduction of ‘democracy’ into the dispositives of ‘standard’ philosophy in order to challenge its transcendental authority over the Real – I argue that performance philosophy might be seen to enact a similar disruption of the ‘dispositives’ of performance theory.  This, however, is only partly what is at stake in the fundamental proposition of performance philosophy, and I conclude by suggesting that a more radical proposal lies behind its assertion of a new ‘field’ – one that does not reduce it to an empirical fact, but grasps it as a radical ‘utopian’ hypothesis designed to ‘open up’ the philosophical dimension of performance itself; utopian because what performance offers – seen in this way - is not simply another system of representation but a possible democratic thought of the Real itself."
10.21476/pp.2015.1122,Laruelle’s ‘Criminally Performative’ Thought: On Doing and Saying in Non-Philosophy,"François Laruelle’s ‘non-philosophical’ practice is connected to its performative language, such that to the question 'what is it to think?, non-philosophy responds that thinking is not “thought”, but performing, and that to perform is to clone the world “in-Real”’ (François Laruelle, ‘What is Non-Philosophy?’ in From Decision to Heresy [2012], 233).Non-philosophy is equally described by Laruelle as ‘transcendental practice’, an ‘immanent pragmatics’, or a ‘universal pragmatics’ that is ‘valid for ordinary language as well as for philosophy:’ He insists that we look at ‘that-which-I-do-in-saying and not just what I say’ – for the latter is simply what happens when thought is ‘taken hold of again by philosophy.’ Resisting this hold, non-philosophy performs re-descriptions of philosophy that, in doing so, produce effects on how philosophical texts are seen. Of course, whether these effects are always desired or are merely nominally considered ‘effects’ such as any description might create (misunderstanding, disbelief, dismay, boredom) is entirely debatable (and a matter for this paper). In accordance with this, however, it is notable that Laruelle objects to the focus on activity within the concept of a speech act, and instead emphasizes the ‘descriptive passivity’ that an immanent pragmatics obliges. Laruelle calls this a ‘Performed-Without-Performation’ which would be an action of the Real: philosophical language seen as a performed, but without a ‘we’ – or any others – performing (or ‘cloning’) it. It is this notion of the performative without either active human or philosophical adumbration, which is the topic of this paper."
10.21476/pp.2015.1126,Missing the Wrong Target: On Andrew Bowie’s Rejection of the Philosophy of Music,"Andrew Bowie rejects the philosophy of music. He does so because it (allegedly) objectifies music and because it (allegedly) only ever affirms the practitioner’s prior philosophical assumptions. I argue that Bowie’s rejection is illegitimate on two counts. First, he mischaracterises the philosophy of music. I show how. Second, even if his characterisation of the philosophy of music were a faithful representation of that discipline, his reasons for rejecting it would still not be sufficient. In particular, Bowie criticises the philosophy of music for not engaging properly with its ‘other’ (music), yet refuses to engage seriously with his own ‘other’ (the philosophy of music). Bowie aims for the wrong target – and misses anyway."
10.21476/pp.2015.1127,Minding the Gap – of Indifference: Approaching ‘Performance Philosophy’ with Salomo Friedlaender (1871-1946),"The concept of ""Creative Indifference"" put forward by Salomo Friedlaender in his 1918 magnum opus, Schöpferische Indifferenz, provides much food for thought from a Performance Philosophy perspective. Friedlaender's work, which has been largely overlooked by academic philosophers until now, was in fact hugely influential in expressionist Dada circles at the time of its publication. It also contributed to shaping Gestalt Therapy theories and practice, thereby relating to a number of bodywork movements that continue to inform performance practice and Performance Philosophy alike. In this short text, Alice Lagaay begins to explore the manner in which Friedlaender/Mynona can be seen as a Performance Philosopher “avant la lettre”, and how the notion of ""Creative Indifference” might be fruitful in the ongoing ""Mind-the-Gap”- debate relating to the relation between “Performance"" and ""Philosophy""."
10.21476/pp.2015.1124,From Semiotics to Philosophy: Daring to Ask the Obvious,"From the late 1960s through the 1980s a steadily-expanding group of international scholars joined forces to develop a comprehensive and unified semiotic theory of theatre. The semiotic wave had largely subsided by the early 1990s, leaving in its wake a profound, and largely justified, scepticism about universal, essentialist, and ahistorical theoretical models. It is possible, however, to ask basic philosophical questions about the ‘nature’ of theatre and performance without falling into the trap of universalizing or essentializing what are, in fact, historically and/or culturally specific practices and biases. In this essay, I advocate an open-ended and dialogic process that characterizes the work of many contemporary philosophers, in both the analytic and continental traditions, and in particular those who have been inspired by the late-Wittgensteinian notion of philosophy as a kind of conceptual therapy."
10.21476/pp.2015.1130,On Performative Philosophy – 10 impulses for discussion from [soundcheck philosophie],"Since 2011, the philosophy-performance festival, [soundcheck philosophie] has been gathering protagonists in German-speaking countries, who seek and intend to cultivate a certain practice in philosophy. This practice takes philosophy - focussing not only on written texts but also on the fundamental oral situations that take place within pilosophy - and presents it artistically and/or through media. In this context. The term ‘Performative Philosophy’ is meant as a working concept for finding criteria and developing contemporary expressions and forms of doing pilosophy. The [soundcheck philosophie] festival and the association responsible for it, Expedition Philosophie / Internationale Gesellschaft für Performative Philosophie, are understood as a forum for discourse. The 10 theses at the end of this article are intended to initiate discussion. Informed by the well-known yet unique structure of an oral conversation, where a lot of things are mentioned out of context and the topic often remains to be discovered, we would also like to contribute impulses for conversation. With this in mind, we have incorporated 10 conversational impulses that answer, tell, ask, state, chat, riddle and reflect about the undertaking of the project of Performative Philosophy."

The work proposes the application of the DMAIC tools, contained in the context of the six sigma, and Value Stream Mapping (VSM) under the lean philosophy perspective in order to identify the focus of waste that can be improved, corroborating with lean thinking. Unlike the common application of VSM, used in manufacturing processes, this study has its application in a service chain. From the Methodology point of view, the case study uses a qualitative approach, having as strategy the bibliographics with a descriptive and explanatory objective. Additionally, it is delineated based on the DMAIC cycle to establish the industrial overview and method of conducting the process study, and consequently, the influence on the management by the guidelines and their impact on the management of the work routine. Thus, the VSM application is presented to control the flow of distributed inventory parts with the current and future process state maps. Finally, the analyzes show the results obtained with the reduction of the waste, from the centralization of the company's inventory."
10.1017/s147717561300047x,TALKING TO OURSELVES? ACADEMIC PHILOSOPHY AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE,"This essay takes a hard look at the current state of much academic (mainly analytic) philosophy and sets out to diagnose where things have gone wrong. It offers a sharply critical assessment of the prevailing narrowness, cliquishness, linguistic inertness, like-mindedness, intellectual caution, misplaced scientism, over-specialisation, guild mentality, lack of creative or inventive flair, and above all the self-perpetuating structures of privilege and patronage that have worked to produce this depressing situation. On the constructive side I suggest how a belated encounter with developments beyond its cultural-professional horizons – including certain aspects of ‘continental’ philosophy – might bring large (and reciprocal) benefits. I also offer some tentative ideas as to what ‘creativity’ could or should mean as applied to philosophical thinking and writing."
10.5539/ells.v6n2p132,Browning’s Religion: The Undecided Philosophy,"&lt;p&gt;Religion is one of the most important themes in Robert Browning’s poetry, and it has attracted many readers, whose goal is to re-examine the truth about the poet’s attitude towards religion. The purpose of this research is to explore the poet’s concept of religion and demonstrate how this is reflected in his poetry. This paper demonstrates that Browning fluctuates between faith and doubt, and yet he is clearer and more confident of his faith than his doubt. In general, Browning’s faith mainly stems from his personal conviction, while his doubts spring from his surroundings in the Victorian society.&lt;/p&gt;"
10.20911/21769389v44n139p305/2017,PHILOSOPHY AS RADICAL SOCIAL CRITIC: SUPPORTING COMMON PEOPLE AGAINST STRONG INSTITUTIONALISM AND SYSTEMIC POLITICS,"Abstract: I argue in this paper that the main task of contemporary philosophy as radical social critic is to face all institutional and systemic powers that monopolize social evolution and institutional legitimation, denying not only an inclusive democracy to common people, but also a democratization of all fields of society. Therefore, philosophy as social critic and political praxis must overcome both the separation between theory and practice and the affirmation of a strong institutionalism as well as the systemic explanation of institutions as the central core for the legitimation and fulfilment of social evolution.Resumen: Sostengo en este artículo que el objetivo principal de la filosofía contemporánea como crítica social es la contraposición y la contención de todos los poderes institucionales y sistémicos que monopolizan la evolución social y la legitimación institucional, socavando una democracia popular inclusiva, así como la democratización de todos los campos constitutivos de la sociedad. La filosofía como crítica social y práxis política debe superar tanto la separación entre teoría y prática como la afirmación y la hegemonía de un institucionalismo fuerte y de la explanación sistémica de las instituciones como la base central para la legitimación y la realización de la evolución social."
10.1017/hgl.2014.3,The Problem of Higher Knowledge in Hegel's Philosophy ,"There are two main aspects of the problem of higher knowledge in Hegel's philosophy. Firstly, how exactly does Hegel appropriate Kant's conception of higher knowledge in the shape of intellectual intuition and intuitive understanding? Secondly, how does Hegel envision the connection of higher knowledge to empirical reality? Recent attempts at answering these questions pull in opposite directions. According to Eckart Förster, Hegel claims knowledge of a supersensible reality, while others, such as James Kreines and Sally Sedgwick, deny this, focusing rather on Hegel's claims to knowledge of nature. I suggest an interpretation where Hegel makes a modest claim to supersensible knowledge but at the same time is unable to provide a satisfactory account of the connection of higher knowledge to empirical reality.

10.21071/mijtk.v0i1.5172,Ibn Sīnā. A Philosophical Mysticism or a Philosophy of Mysticism?,"It is a well-known fact that Ibn Sīnā in the final part of his work al-Ishārāt wa-l-tanbīhāt, Pointers and Reminders, extensively uses a mystical vocabulary. Given this fact some scholars have judged that he in this – in all likelihood rather late – work adheres to a kind of mysticism, either religious or, at least, philosophical. Based on a detailed analysis of some of the most significant passages, the present paper offers evidence that such an interpretation does not pay enough attention to the very way in which Ibn Sīnā interprets the mystical notions that are undeniably present in the last three sections of the Ishārāt. In fact, Ibn Sīnā’s use of them reveals to have nothing, or almost nothing in common with the meaning attributed to them in Sufi-writings, or in (mainly Neoplatonic) ‘mystical’ philosophy. It is concluded that Ibn Sīnā, in the final part of the Ishārāt, offers what may be labelled a ‘philosophical project that rationally interprets mystical terms, expressions, and phenomena’, rather than as ‘a philosophical mysticism’."

Is it simple literary skill a person has? Is it a gift from God? or Is it a situational enforcement that vibrate that gift or skill and finally envisages as form of creation. Then what type of situational enforcement it can be? Answer came – as this activity is totally associated with imagination, perception, vision so that it can be said that brain is the main central point that activate the situation. And if it is brain, then no wonder that mood must be the main catalyst in the whole process. As mood is not a stationery object, it always swings from one state to another state, it can be said that this mood is the main philosophy behind any literary creation.&lt;/p&gt;"

Dentro da filosofia clássica grega, o autor aponta para a tendência transcendental e subversiva da dialética platônica, em oposição à lógica formal aristotélica, que, por meio de julgamentos formais sobre a realidade, procura antecipar os critérios de verdade e falsidade. Essa antecipação ganha status de controle, pois nega qualquer possibilidade de transcendência do momento positivo – o que, levado para uma análise política da sociedade industrial avançada, dá à dominação uma legitimação lógica.

This is the context in which we glimpse the advent of modern technoscience, which has significantly contributed to the increment of human control over nature. This study aims to analyze, under the focus of bioethics, reflections on the philosophy of science as they relate to the neutrality of science and converge with epistemic rationality, as well as to relate those reflections to the process of making decisions in the administration of technoscience. The study has raised doubts about the capacity of technoscientific knowledge to legitimize and justify the decisions within the ambit of the national science and technology systems, thus signaling the need for promoting a link between technoscientific self-regulation and bioethic hetero-regulation."

This has, perhaps unsurprisingly, been a neglected area of enquiry given the paucity of Hobbes's analysis of this aspect of the human passions. I argue that this new field of enquiry is to be welcomed as it allows us to explore and understand Hobbes as a fully erotic philosopher. Moreover, his erotic philosophy is best understood through the prism of his thorough-going materialism."
10.21913/jps.v3i1.1300,Philosophy goes to school in Australia: A history 1982-2016,"This paper is an attempt to highlight significant developments in the history of philosophy in schools in Australia.[1] We commence by looking at the early years when Laurance Splitter visited the Institute for the Advancement for Philosophy for Children (IAPC). Then we offer an account of the events that led to the formation of what is now the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations (FAPSA), the development and production of a diverse range of curriculum and supporting materials for philosophy in schools, the making of the Australasian journal, and more recent events. Our purpose is to create further interest in exploring this complex and rich history. This will achieve a better understanding of the possible future directions for classroom practice and research.[1]     An earlier draft of this paper was presented at the 45th Annual Conference of the Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia (see Burgh &amp; Thornton 2016)."

Such a range, we hoped, would demonstrate the broad relevance of philosophical inquiry, and provide wonderful professional development opportunities for all of our P4C colleagues in New Zealand, and for our visitors from Australia and further afield.[1]     The dates of the conference were Monday 18 April and Tuesday 19 April 2016, with the Philosophy in Action Day held on Wednesday 20 April 2016."
10.21913/jps.v1i1.993,"Fact, Value and Philosophy Education","In Fact, value and philosophy education I tried to show how philosophy can help to overcome the fact-value divide that continues to plague education. In attempting this, I applied John Dewey’s suggestion that philosophy may help to integrate beliefs about matters of fact with values in society at large, to the curricular division between subjects that deal with knowledge of matters of fact and those that are largely devoted to subjective understanding and personal expression. The paper centres on the claim that philosophical dialogue about what we should believe and value can help to effect a mutual adjustment between our reason and our sentiments and bring us to think as whole human beings. It argues the case by first looking at the use of reflective practical reason to effect a change in our desires and conduct when we deem them to be undesirable. The use of reason to provide us with courses of action and other practical remedies to deal with what we see as defects in our character suggests that our cognitive and affective powers are capable of working together through mutual adjustment. By extension, I argue that reason can help us to examine the moral dimension of problems and issues in various areas of study, while making our understanding of them responsive to our feelings. The introduction of an educational means to give effect to this mutual adjustment brings us back to the role of philosophy. Philosophy provides the opportunity for reasoned dialogue that brings the factual material that students encounter into connection with what they are learning to value. It brings a normative cast to the study of history, society, literature, art, science and technology and enables the knowledge that students gain through their studies to be applied to matters of value. In general, it brings moral sensitivity to all kinds of subject matter and enables students to apply their knowledge and intelligence to the formation of values. In the years since I wrote this piece, I had the privilege to assist with the initial draft of documents on ethical understanding as a general competence in the Australian national curriculum and of constructing and implementing a pilot program for ethical inquiry in New South Wales primary schools, which led to ethics becoming an option for students who do not attend religious instruction. In different ways, both experiences brought home to me the importance of incorporating considerations of value throughout the curriculum and the value of philosophical inquiry as a means of doing so. Reflection on these experiences resulted in my book Teaching Ethics in Schools (ACER Press 2010)."
10.21913/jps.v1i1.994,A Handy Account of Philosophy in Schools,"Philosophy in Schools is a complex educational practice, unfamiliar to most teachers and philosophers, subtly different to similar forms of education, and so easy to misunderstand and mishandle. Because of this, a common worry for practitioners is whether they are doing it properly. Given this slipperiness of Philosophy in Schools, one of my main concerns has been to give an account that would be useful; that could guide practitioners to teach well. I presented my first account in a 2006 article ‘What is Philosophy in Schools?’ which was based on 14 years’ experience as a Philosophy in Schools teacher and teacher educator. Now, by invitation of the editors, I have the privilege to present a re-worked, improved account. This builds on and synthesises my previous publications, but it also significantly refines anything I have previously written, and is the culmination of my work in Philosophy in Schools."
10.21913/jps.v1i1.995,Preparing Teachers to 'Teach' Philosophy for Children,"Like many others, I have resisted the idea that education, in general, is a form of training. We always talk about training for something, while an educated person is not educated for any one thing. But for this very reason, I do not wish to abandon the term ‘teacher training’ in favor of ‘teacher education’, although ideally I would prefer to speak of ‘teacher preparation’ (or even ‘teacher formation’) because the term ‘training’ always reminds me of monkeys. I shall use the terms ‘training’ and ‘preparation’ interchangeably, with both standing in contrast to ‘education’. All persons deserve to be educated; there is nothing specific to teachers here. Teacher training, whether general or specific to a subject or discipline, remains a contentious business. Some regard Pedagogy as a legitimate subject area (I used to teach a subject entitled The Art and Science of Effective Teaching) and structure training around it; others prefer to see teacher training firmly in the context of the various disciplines that teachers will, in turn, be teaching: mathematics, literature, history and, in this case, philosophy. Indeed, when it comes to training teachers to teach philosophy, the problem is exacerbated by the plain fact that most teachers have no formal background in philosophy. So we are faced with the rather daunting prospect of providing such a background (teaching philosophy) as well as providing whatever is needed in order to teach philosophy to others (e.g. children). Matthew Lipman and Ann Margaret Sharp were well aware of this challenge when they set up the first training programs in Philosophy for Children (p4c) at Montclair State College (as it was then) in the early 1970s; hence the requirement that if classroom teachers were not actually qualified in philosophy (however that is interpreted!), at least those who trained them to do philosophy with children should be. However, this idealistic model was always going to be difficult to apply. The problem, as it developed in countries around the world, was two-fold: teachers with little or no philosophical background were, increasingly, being trained by other educators who were in the same boat (hence the fear that however good the pedagogy, there would be little or no philosophy actually being done in classrooms); and conversely, when professional philosophers did become involved in teacher training, it quickly became apparent that they (often) lacked any real training in pedagogy, and so were inadequate to the task of modeling the role of the teacher in the (pre-tertiary) classroom. To look on the bright side, some constructive attempts have been made to resolve these shortcomings. The one with which I am most familiar (being one of those who instituted it) is the Australian model for what is termed ‘Level Two training’, that is, training those who will, in turn, train and work with classroom teachers. This model recognizes the complementary requirements of philosophical and pedagogic expertise, respectively, by awarding certificates of achievement based on whether those trained have come from the discipline of philosophy, the practice of teaching (children), or both. Ideally, then, training workshops for teachers would be directed by at least one person in the former category, and at least one in the latter."
10.21913/jps.v2i1.1103,Book review - Philosophy park: A beginner’s guide to great philosophers and their ideas,"Those with at least in passing interest in Philosophy for Children will be aware of the work of Philip Cam. Cam’s corpus of texts have provided educators with countless insights, activities and resources for developing philosophical investigations and thinking with young people. Philosophy park: A beginner’s guide to great philosophers and their ideas is a significant addition to this body of work. Tackling the complex ideas of leading philosophers in the Western tradition, Cam has achieved something that is often rather rare—the ability to convey complex ideas in an accessible and engaging way. The main tool employed is the use of stories, each of which draws out a central idea within the thought of the philosopher or school of philosophers at hand."
10.21913/jps.v1i1.998,Philosophy and Childhood,"The following paper was written in 1999, as the opening speech at the Hobart FAPCA (Federation of Australasian Philosophy for Children Associations now FAPSA) National Conference. I was, at the time, Chair of FAPCA. The keynote speaker at the conference was Professor Gareth Matthews from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and author of, among other books, The Philosophy of Childhood. As the paper was written as a speech, and not as an academic article, I did not cite all the points made in full academic mode. Rather, for publication in Critical and Creative Thinking, I added a list of further reading which gives details for all the articles and books mentioned in the speech. At the time, I had just completed my PhD (the thesis is cited in the further reading), and taken up the position of International Baccalaureate Coordinator at The Friends’ School in Hobart. Subsequently in 2001, a revised and abridged version of the thesis was published by Routledge under the title Philosophical Discussion in Moral Education, and readers who are interested in following up some of my points made in the paper can find more detail there."
10.21913/jps.v1i1.988,The Educational Role of Philosophy (with a new commentary by Phillip Cam),"The history of the relationship between philosophy and education has been a long and troubled one. In part, this stemmed from the problematic nature of philosophy itself, but this difficulty was compounded by controversy as to the age at which training in philosophy should begin. Although Socrates seemed indifferent to whether he conversed philosophically with young or old, his pupil, Plato, was inclined to restrict philosophy to mature students, on the grounds that it made the younger ones unduly contentious. Since philosophers in those days had the reputation of being ‘friends of wisdom,’ and since being a friend of wisdom seemed to require extensive experience, it came to be taken for granted, generation after generation, that philosophy was not for the young. It has sometimes been made available, on a limited basis, at the secondary school level, but almost never to students in the lower grades. To the suggestion that this prevented children from having access to ideas, theories and abstract concepts, the stock response was that children were mired in the ‘concrete’ level of experience and had no interest in abstractions. To the report that very young children almost invariably greeted opportunities to discuss philosophy with joy and delight, the standard reply was that this proved that the children could not be doing philosophy, since the study of philosophy is a serious and difficult matter. The recent career of philosophy in elementary and secondary education has been a matter of overcoming precisely these objection and misconceptions. Unfortunately, a listing of the advantages to be derived by the young from the study of philosophy—its strengthening of reasoning and judgment, its fostering of concept-formation skills, its clarification of values and ideals—is likely to obscure the intrinsic satisfactions that children derive from their classroom communities of philosophical inquiry. But even here there are signs of change, and a new appreciation of the educational possibilities of philosophy is at last beginning to surface in the schools."
10.21913/jps.v2i1.1099,Practicing philosophy of childhood: Teaching in the (r)evolutionary mode,"This article explores the necessary requirements for effective teacher facilitation of community of philosophical inquiry sessions among children, and suggests that the first and most important prerequisite is the capacity to listen to children, which in turn is based on a critical and reflective interrogation of one’s own philosophy of childhood (POC)—the set of beliefs and assumptions about children and childhood which adults tend to project onto real children. It argues that the most effective way to explore these assumptions is in community of philosophical inquiry (CPI), where we encounter the same concepts—nature, person, good and evil, innocence, etc.—which underlie more general philosophical inquiry. It then describes the work of the American educator Patricia Carini, who developed the Descriptive Review Process as a phenomenological approach to understanding the children with whom one is in relation, and identifies the Descriptive Review Process as another form of the practice of philosophy of childhood which, together with the regular practice of POC-CPI among teachers, offers us a grounded, integrated methodology for schools dedicated to adult-child dialogue and to school as a site for cultural reconstruction."
10.21913/jps.v4i1.1423,Book Review: The Routledge International Handbook of Philosophy for Children,"The Routledge international handbook of philosophy for children offers ‘a wide variety of critical perspectives on this diverse and controversial field, in order to generate new discussions and to identify emerging questions and themes’ (xxi). As a collection of scholarly papers on Philosophy for Children (P4C), the volume is a thorough and detailed handbook which highlights the distance P4C has travelled since its inception 50 years ago. Several uses of this volume spring to mind. Somebody new to P4C would do well to read the concise introduction which covers the history and thematic strands which shape P4C. Experienced practitioners or researchers could use the handbook to explore new directions and ideas in the field. School leaders and policy makers could refer to the section headings to identify uses of P4C that would pertain to their particular situations. The editors have identified a fairly definitive list of key questions for P4C; while the papers do not form a cohesive whole, they do function as a useful handbook to give readers a taste of some of the answers currently available to these questions. "
10.21913/jps.v2i1.1100,Socrates in the schools from Scotland to Texas: Replicating a study on the effects of a Philosophy for Children program,"In this article we report the findings of a randomised control clinical trial that assessed the impact of a Philosophy for Children program and replicated a previous study conducted in Scotland by Topping and Trickey. A Cognitive Abilities Test (CAT in the UK or CogAT in the USA) was administered as a pretest and a posttest to randomly selected experimental groups (N = 363, 186 seventh graders + 177 eighth graders) and control groups (N = 177, 79 seventh graders + 98 eighth graders). The students in the experimental group engaged in philosophy lessons in a setting of structured, collaborative inquiry in their language arts classes for one hour per week for a number of weeks. The control group received the standard language arts curriculum in that one hour. The study found that the seventh grade students who had experienced the P4C program showed significant gains relative to those in the seventh grade control group at a high level of statistical significance, but the eighth grade students in the experimental group did not show such gains over the eighth grade control group. It was discovered that the seventh grade teachers started the program early in the school year and continued it for a period of 22 to 26 weeks, while the eighth grade teachers started much later and used the program for only 4 to 10 weeks. Our findings suggest that the P4C program must involve students in activities for a significant period of time before the program shows results, but that a meaningful impact on students’ cognitive abilities can be achieved in about 24 weeks of lessons, less than half the time evidenced by the study by Topping and Trickey."

In sketching these connections we suggest some areas where the relationship is potentially fruitful, particularly in light of research which suggests that in practice schools and teachers often adopt and mix different approaches to values education. We outline some implications of drawing connections between the two fields for moral education. The arguments made in this article are done so in the hope of encouraging further critical reflection on the potential relationship between Philosophy for Children and character education."
10.21913/jps.v2i2.1272,Philosophy for Children and the ‘whole child’,"The notion of educating the ‘whole child’ invites suspicion because of the value-laden assumptions carried by such a goal. I argue that the intuitive appeal of the notion reflects the meaning of education but that the goal is also implicit in P4C in its respect for wholeness in content, rationale and practices whereby the learner is honoured and engaged. In this paper, I focus on the senior high school curriculum in which the rich resources of philosophy can speak to the broad range of students’ questions and concerns: intellectual, existential and social, addressing (and challenging) their ‘whole’ persons with its legacy of wisdom."
10.21913/jps.v3i1.1302,Book review - Philosophy in schools: An introduction for philosophers and teachers,"Philosophy in Schools: An introduction for philosophers and teachers edited by Sara Goering, Nicholas J Shudak and Thomas E Wartenberg (2013). (Routledge Studies in Contemporary Philosophy) Taylor &amp; Francis, New York, NY. ISBN: 9780415640633. The edited collection Philosophy in Schools: An introduction for philosophers and teachers is exactly that; an introduction to the central ideas of the Philosophy in Schools movement, with tips and strategies as to how to implement Philosophy for Children (P4C) in your classroom or educational space. With 25 chapters, this handy edition includes the writings of 31 academics and well known practitioners of P4C worldwide. While all the voices contributing to this volume are positive and optimistic as they exalt the benefits of P4C, the diversity comes in the form of the various ways in which the numerous authors have practiced philosophy with participants of different ages, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds. There is a mix of theory and pedagogy, with a focus on the pragmatic reality of doing philosophy with young people."
10.21913/jps.v3i2.1351,Children’s activism and guerrilla philosophy,"This paper explores how engaging in and with philosophy in the streets has unique and special potential for children doing philosophy both inside and outside the classroom. We highlight techniques drawn from research into the political, social and activist potential of street art, and we illustrate how to apply these techniques in a P4C context in what we call guerrilla philosophy. We argue that guerrilla philosophy is a pedagogically powerful method to philosophically engage students whose ages range from 11-13. In calling attention to the power of guerrilla philosophy to engage students philosophically, we are tacitly assuming a Deweyan philosophical approach (Dewey 1916, 1925, 1934), which emphasises (1) the importance of promoting civic-mindedness as a social value; (2) the reliance on imaginative, creative and experiential forms of learning as essential to education ; and (3) a vision of the classroom as an embodiment of the larger civic community to which we all belong and in which we all must cooperate and engage (Dewey 1916). This paper traces these three themes in Dewey’s philosophical views of education and democracy, and considers how they are given a twenty-first century interpretation through street art, guerrilla philosophy and children’s activism."
10.21913/jps.v4i1.1418,On the seam: Philosophy with Palestinian girls in an East Jerusalem village as a pedagogy of searching,"The ‘Marwa’ elementary school (pseudonym) – an Israeli public school on the border between Israel and the Palestinian Authority – is a unique educational institution in that, despite being not religious, it only accepts from Grade 1 through to Grade 6 girls. Several years ago, the principal decided to implement a Philosophy with Children (PwC) programme as an alternative pedagogy. This paper surveys how the educational faculty regarded the introduction of this curriculum and how it contributed towards the development of philosophical discursive skills, a classroom atmosphere of friendship and caring, and critical and creative thinking competence amongst the students."
10.21913/jps.v4i1.1421,How effective is Philosophy for Children in contributing to the affective engagement of pupils in the context of secondary Religious Education?,"This paper reports the findings of a predominantly qualitative study that explored the effects of the practice of Philosophy for Children (P4C) on pupils’ affective engagement.[1] From its conception, the practice of P4C has been linked to the development of caring and collaborative thinking and the study aimed to closely consider that relationship. An appropriate self-designed P4C program was implemented with 75 Year 9 pupils (aged 14 and 15) of Religious Education (a compulsory subject in the British education system in which pupils explore world religions in a non-confessional manner) at an independent secondary school in the United Kingdom. An interpretive research approach was taken and thematic analysis was appropriated to analyse the data. Findings supported the claims of previous research that P4C can foster affective engagement in many pupils, particularly those pupils who find emotional expression and interpersonal interactions challenging. A tentative conclusion reached supposes that P4C has the potential to contribute to the affective engagement of pupils, but with the recommendation that implementing a P4C program must be executed carefully and with the mindfulness that it may not have the same potential or usefulness for all pupils universally.[1] This research was conducted at the University College London. The author is currently a doctoral candidate at the University of Birmingham."

10.18806/tesl.v30i2.1142,Let’s Talk! ESL Students’ Needs and Writing Centre Philosophy,"When university/college faculty members believe that ESL students’ writing skills are not equivalent to those of native speakers, they frequently send these ESL students to their institution’s writing centres (WCs). However, this often results in frustra- tion for WC staff, the students, and faculty members. This article first describes ESL students’ language-learning backgrounds and expectations, as well as WCs’ still- evolving philosophy and practices, to demonstrate that ESL students visiting WCs are still often caught between two opposing educational frameworks. The article then offers possible solutions and discusses the importance of initiating dialogue among ESL instructors, ESL students, WC staff, and university/college professors.Quand les professeurs au collège ou à l’université croient que la compétence en rédaction des étudiants en ALS n’est pas équivalente à celle des locuteurs natifs, ils les envoient souvent aux centres de rédaction de leur institution. Il en résulte souvent de la frustration de la part du personnel des centres, des étudiants et des professeurs. Cet article débute par une description des antécédents et des attentes des étudiants en ALS d’une part, et des pratiques et de la philosophie en évolution des centres de rédaction d’autre part, de sorte à démontrer que les étudiants qui vont aux centres de rédaction se retrouvent encore souvent coincés entre deux cadres pédagogiques en opposition. Cet article offre des solutions possibles et dis- cute l’importance d’amorcer un dialogue entre les enseignants en ALS, les étu- diants en ALS, le personnel des centres de rédaction et les professeurs aux niveaux collégial et universitaire."
10.1093/oso/9780190467876.003.0007,"Philosophy, Theater, and Love","In the tenth book of Plato’s The Republic, Socrates famously invokes an ancient quarrel between philosophy and tragedy (among other art forms). In the Symposium, he shows philosophy triumphing over tragedy when Socrates bests Agathon, a tragic poet who has just taken first place at the Festival of Dionysus, in a competition for the best speech in praise of love. This chapter argues that Hedda Gabler represents an important further stage in this ongoing quarrel, one that takes the fight to philosophy’s home turf: that of soul-transforming conversation. In plays such as A Doll’s House, Ibsen develops a form of theater that takes on the Socratic aspiration to facilitate serious conversation. Hedda Gabler, though, goes even further. In this play Ibsen develops a form of theater that not only takes over the Socratic aspiration, but at the same time transforms it by transforming our understanding of what such conversation might consist in."
10.1017/s026505251700019x,"MAKING PHILOSOPHICAL PROGRESS: THE BIG QUESTIONS, APPLIED PHILOSOPHY, AND THE PROFESSION","Abstract:
            The debate over whether philosophy makes progress has focused on its failure to answer a core set of “big” questions. I argue that there are other kinds of philosophical progress which are equally important yet underappreciated: the creative development of new “philosophical devices” which increase our ability to think about the world, and the broadening of philosophical topics to ever greater adequacy to what matters. The conception of philosophy as defined by a narrow “core” set of questions is responsible for skepticism about progress, as well as for philosophy’s “marketing problem” — its failure to reach the general public. I argue for abandoning the distinction between “core” and “marginal” questions. The greater openness of philosophy to methodological diversity and diversity in topics, especially applied topics, will make a distinct kind of progress: in the breadth and completeness of the questions asked, phenomena investigated, and theories generated. Such openness may also make philosophy more hospitable to more diverse practitioners. This would also be conducive to progress, in the sense of reaching true answers to philosophical questions: greater diversity of philosophical practitioners has epistemic benefits, such as increasing objectivity."
10.1093/oso/9780198738909.003.0003,Global Philosophy of Religion and its Challenges,"This chapter argues that if the philosophy of religion is to take religion seriously, it must expand its focus and incorporate a wide range of religious perspectives. The chapter develops a ‘global philosophy of religion’ by critically assessing two earlier attempts to transform the philosophy of religion: Ninian Smart’s ‘philosophy of worldviews’ and John Hick’s ‘global theology’. The global philosophy of religion is more constructive than these two approaches because it emphasizes common issues that philosophers in distinct traditions can tackle together. Moreover, the global philosophy of religion moves beyond interreligious dialogue without demanding commitment to any controversial meta-theory, such as religious pluralism or religious inclusivism."
10.1093/oso/9780198738909.003.0013,Spinoza’s Philosophy of Religious Life,"This chapter argues that the philosophy of Spinoza provides a productive basis for renewing philosophy of religion. It begins by distinguishing between ‘insider’ and ‘outsider’ approaches to philosophy of religion, indicating the limitations of both approaches, and suggesting that Spinoza exemplifies a middle way between them. Such an approach takes religion as its object of study in a non-confessional manner, yet is receptive to the practical, ethical, and existential aspects of religion. Philosophers of religion should seek to understand and evaluate not only key tenets of religious belief, but religious life as a whole. Integral to religious life is the possibility of transformation; a key task of philosophy of religion is understanding how reason, action, and identity may be transformed through religious life. From Spinoza’s expansive account of human cognition as inseparable from affects, ethical conduct, and practices, we can draw a new basis for thinking philosophically about religion."
10.1093/oso/9780198738909.003.0008,"The Future of Philosophy of Religion, the Future of the Study of Religion, and (Even) the Future of Religion","This chapter makes a three-part case for a more ambitious, more comprehensive, and richer philosophy of religion than that with which we are currently familiar, at least in the English-speaking world. First, it is unsatisfactory for philosophy of religion to consist mostly in philosophical reflection about issues pertaining to a single religion, or to a single religion and its close relatives. Second, many scholars of religion, irrespective of their field of study or training, would benefit from having more access to philosophical tools. Philosophy of religion could, and should, be of more service in this area. Third, an expanded philosophy of religion can contribute to the future development of religion—that is, to the direction, and forms, that religion will take in the future."
10.1093/oso/9780198738909.003.0010,Continental Philosophy of Religion in a Kenotic Tone,"In this chapter, an account is offered of what renewal in continental philosophy of religion might involve. It is argued that a “kenotic tone” is needed. In particular, in order for continental philosophy to live, it must die to itself in the areas of confession, insularity, and arrogance. Such a kenotic tone should signal that continental philosophy of religion is not concerned about reinforcing its own significance, but instead is significant because it offers important resources for thinking philosophically—but also personally, hospitably, and humbly—about religion. This account of renewal in continental philosophy of religion, in turn, is likely to foster productive engagement both with analytic philosophers of religion and also with scholars in other fields working in the academic study of religion."
10.1093/oso/9780198767176.003.0009,The Augustinianism 2 of The Consolation of Philosophy,"Chapter 6 examines Boethius’ Consolation of Philosophy, focusing in particular on book 5. In Consolation 5, references to prayer are embedded within a dialogue between a prisoner and a personification of philosophy on the theme of divine foreknowledge and human freedom. By placing prayer within a broader philosophical and literary context, Boethius extends his Augustinianism to explore the boundaries and texture of Christian existence as it attempts to reach up from human ratio to divine intellegentia. Here Boethius demonstrates his Augustinianism 2, as he creatively reconstellates Augustine’s use of prayer in De trinitate to help him solve a different, though related, problem. The Augustinianism of the Consolation best comes into view when seen through Boethius’ references to prayer."

Immanenz in zeitgenössischer Kunst und Philosophie.,"Diese bi-linguale Sonderausgabe des Performance Philosophy Journals, die erste in deutscher und englischer Sprache, ist das Ergebnis des Forschungsprojekts „Artist-Philosophers. Philosophy AS Arts-based Research“, das vom Österreichischen Wissenschaftsfonds (FWF): AR275-G21 im Kontext des Programmes zur Entwicklung und Erschließung der Künste (PEEK) gefördert wurde. Eine zentrale Fragestellung des PEEK-Projekts lautete: „Was geschieht mit dem traditionellen Bild der Philosophie, wenn Philosoph_innen beginnen, den Prozess des Philosophierens im öffentlichen Raum aufzuführen und kunst-basierte Praktiken in ihre Disziplin einzubeziehen?“ Ausgehend von unserer Annahme, dass Bedeutungen und Möglichkeiten aus differenziellen Beziehungen heraus generiert werden, die jemand mit anderen in einem konkreten weltlichen Milieu immanent teilt, haben wir im Verlauf des genannten Forschungsprojektes zwei Veranstaltungen realisiert, aus denen diese Publikation maßgeblich hervorgegangen ist: Das Forschungsfestival Philosophy On Stage #4 „Artist-Philosophers. Nietzsche et cetera“, das im November 2015 am Tanzquartier Wien stattfand, sowie die Konferenz „Immanenz in zeitgenössischer Kunst und Philosophie“ im Angewandte Innovation Lab (AIL) Wien. Diese Ausgabe des Performance Philosophy Journals umfasst Beiträge von: Arno Böhler, Laura Cull Ó Maoilearca, Paulo de Assis, Susanne Valerie Granzer, Alice Lagaay, Dieter Mersch, John Ó Maoilearca, Freddie Rokem, Elisabeth Schäfer, Andreas Urs Sommer, Marcus Steinweg, Tanja Traxler, Stephen Zepke."
10.21476/pp.2017.33143,"Laruelle, Immanence, and Performance: What Does Non-Philosophy Do?","François Laruelle’s ‘non-philosophical’ practice is connected to its performative language, such that to the question 'what is it to think?, non-philosophy responds that thinking is not “thought”, but performing. Non-philosophy is equally described by Laruelle as ‘transcendental practice’, an ‘immanent pragmatics’, or a ‘universal pragmatics’ that is ‘valid for ordinary language as well as for philosophy:’ He insists that we look at ‘that-which-I-do-in-saying and not just what I say’ – for the latter is simply what happens when thought is ‘taken hold of again by philosophy.’ Resisting this hold, non-philosophy performs re-descriptions of philosophy that, in doing so, produce effects on how philosophical texts are seen. All the same, it is notable that Laruelle objects to the focus on activity within the concept of a speech act, and instead emphasizes the ‘descriptive passivity’ that an immanent pragmatics obliges; statements that manifest ‘by their very existence what they must describe in the last instance – statements identically descriptive and performative.’ What Laruelle calls a ‘Performed-Without-Performation’ would be an action of the Real, or the ‘in-One’ – philosophical language seen as a performed without we using this or any language to perform. In this essay, this complex thought is compared with certain concepts and practices of performance that do not come from philosophy so explicitly (Allan Kaprow’s, Richard Schechner’s and Michael Kirby’s especially), but may well offer a key to understanding this passive action of the Real."
10.21476/pp.2017.33162,"Equalizing Theatre and Philosophy: Laruelle, Badiou, and gestures of authority in the philosophy of theatre","In this article I engage François Laruelle’s notion of ‘non-standard’ aesthetics to provide a critical perspective on Alain Badiou’s various pronouncements on the philosophy of theatre. Whilst in works such as In Praise of Theatre (2015), Badiou initially appears magnanimous in relation to theatre’s own thinking, and indeed to demote the function of philosophy in relation to an ontological privilege now accorded (by him) to set theory, I will argue that this very benevolence, from a Laruellian perspective, constitutes another form of philosophical authoritarianism. That is, whilst Badiou famously describes theatre as ‘an event of thought’ that ‘directly produces ideas’ (Badiou 2005a, 72), this article draws from Laruelle to suggest that he ultimately positions himself as the authority on what ‘counts as theatre properly speaking’ (Badiou 2013, 109); performatively positioning his own thought as normative exception and as the gatekeeper to that exception."
10.21476/pp.2017.33191,Introduction: Philosophy On Stage: The Concept of Immanence in Contemporary Art and Philosophy,"This special issue of the Performance Philosophy journal—the first bilingual edition in German and English—is one output of the research project “Artist-Philosophers. Philosophy AS Arts-based Research”, funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF): AR275-G21 in the context of the Programme for Arts-based Research (PEEK). A main question of the project was: “What happens to the traditional image of philosophy, once philosophers start to stage philosophy and implement arts-based practices into their discipline?” Starting from the philosophical assumption that meanings and possibilities are generated immanently out of the differential relations somebody shares with others within a concrete earthly milieu, we realised two main events in the course of the above-mentioned research project, on which this publication is based: The research festival Philosophy on Stage #4 „Artist-Philosophers. Nietzsche et cetera“ at Tanzquartier Wien in November 2015 and the conference “The Concept of Immanence in Philosophy and the Arts” at Angewandte Innovation Lab (AIL) Vienna. This issue of the Performance Philosophy Journal comprises texts by: Arno Böhler, Laura Cull Ó Maoilearca, Paulo de Assis, Susanne Valerie Granzer, Alice Lagaay, Dieter Mersch, John Ó Maoilearca, Freddie Rokem, Elisabeth Schäfer, Andreas Urs Sommer, Marcus Steinweg, Tanja Traxler, Stephen Zepke."
10.1093/oso/9780198796732.003.0004,"Naturalism, Involved Philosophy, and the Human Predicament","Scientistic naturalism is an important current in contemporary philosophy, but it offers a skewed and impoverished account of nature, human existence, and the nature of philosophy. This chapter first presents and contrasts this form of naturalism with two opposing varieties: extended and expansive naturalism. As the chapter shows, extended and especially expansive naturalism point toward a conception of philosophy as an “involved,” hermeneutic discipline, which is incompatible with scientistic naturalism. This conception of philosophy is then enriched by taking into account Cottingham’s religious epistemology of involvement and Heidegger’s elaboration of the hermeneutic circle. As it turns out, a genuinely involved approach to philosophy requires, as its starting-point, a hermeneutics of the human predicament. Key aspects of such a hermeneutics are introduced by means of Luther’s existential theology. Finally, six main points of an involved philosophy, taken as a new model of religious understanding, are formulated."
10.1093/oso/9780198796732.003.0012,Love and Philosophy of Religion,"This chapter proposes that contemporary philosophers of religion can learn from the first group of thinkers who engaged in philosophy of religion in the English language: the seventeenth-century Cambridge Platonists. Working under the dire conditions of the English Civil Wars, they nonetheless advanced a robust defense of tolerance, a moral and theological realism that saw goodness in terms of a love for nature rather than arbitrary volition, and a philosophical methodology that took religious practice and cultivating virtue (justice, integrity, and especially charity or love) seriously in the practice of philosophy of religion. Cudworth, More, Smith, and others exercised an admirable spirit and principle of charity that were instrumental in challenging the racism and exploitation of their times. The chapter defends the contemporary importance of such charity and identifies cases when philosophers today at least seem to take anti-charitable, derogatory, condemnatory views of their colleagues in philosophy of religion."
10.1093/oso/9780198801887.003.0002,Methodological Confusion in Armchair and Experimental Philosophy,"The chapter closely examines John Hawthorne’s introduction of the “lottery paradox” in Knowledge and Lotteries (2004) and Joshua Knobe and Sean Nichols’ “Experimental Philosophy Manifesto” (2008), together with other related works of experimental philosophers, with the aim of illustrating the deep confusion about the method of cases on the part of both its armchair practitioners and their experimental critics/reformers. The examination of these texts also serves to raise some of the main issues that will be discussed in subsequent chapters."
10.1515/kierke-2017-0015,"The Voice of Conscience, Kierkegaard’s Theory of Indirect Communication, and Buber’s Philosophy of Dialogue","AbstractThis paper investigates the concept and the experience of conscience as an interface of aesthetic, ethical, and religious aspects of Kierkegaard’s existential approach, while criticizing his reductionist definition of ‘aesthetics’ and the opposition he draws between ethics and aesthetics. A comparison of Kierkegaard’s theory of indirect ‘existence’-communication with Martin Buber’s philosophy of dialogue shows that Kierkegaard overlooks three crucial moments of truly liberating, conscientious communication, including the dialogical dynamics of becoming-oneself vis-à-vis the Other."
10.1515/kierke-2017-0012,“Philosophy and Christianity can never be united”: The Role of Sibbern and Martensen in Kierkegaard’s Reception of Schleiermacher,"AbstractThe present article explores the possible influence of Schleiermacher on Kierkegaard based primarily on a reading of the famous journal entry AA:13, in which the young Kierkegaard declares “Philosophy and Christianity can never be united.” It is argued that Kierkegaard’s reflections here and later constitute a part of an ongoing critical discussion with a number of Danish thinkers who were likewise interested in the issue of the relation of philosophy to Christianity or knowledge to faith. Schleiermacher’s thought can thus be seen to have passed through a Danish filter, which is the primary context for Kierkegaard’s engagement with it."
10.1515/auk-1998-0201,Social Ontology and the Philosophy of Society,AbstractThis lecture was originally given at the Einstein Forum in Berlin. It contains a summary of some of the themes in my book The Construction of Social Reality and continues the line of argument I presented there.
10.1515/auk-1988-0203,The Limits of Homo Economicus in Public Choice and in Political Philosophy,"AbstractThis paper argues that there are areas of political behavior for which the usual assumption of wealth maximizing homo economicus is to narrow to generate convincing explanation of behavior. In particular, it is argued that for many political decisions, people choose according to some set of moral preconceptions while for others, people have insufficient information to make economic choices even if they were inclined to do so. This implies that normative public choice can only be part of a political decision process in which non-pecuniary concerns influence choices . Finally, constitutional economics insofar as it is conceptually conceived, must presume some set of moral and informational properties of the parties to the social contract."
10.1515/auk-2008-0110,"Moral Philosophy, Moral Identity and Moral Cacophony: On MacIntyre on the Modern Self","AbstractThis paper focuses on Alasdair MacIntyre’s critique of the modern self, arguing that we are not as bereft of the resources to engage in rational thought about value as he makes out. I claim that MacIntyre’s argument presumes that philosophy has a much greater power to shape individuals and cultures than it in fact has. In particular, he greatly exaggerates the extent to which the character of the modern self has been an effect of the philosophical views of the self that have been influential during the period, leading him to be overly pessimistic about its nature and powers. Finally, I argue that MacIntyre has provided us with no strong reason for thinking that a moral tradition structured by modern values could not be viable."
10.1515/auk-2008-0214,On the Relationship between Political Philosophy and Empirical Sciences,"AbstractIn this paper, I will focus on the role that findings of the empirical sciences might play in justifying normative claims in political philosophy. In the first section, I will describe how political theory has become a discipline divorced from empirical sciences, against a strong current in post-war political philosophy. I then argue that Rawls’s idea of reflective equilibrium, rightly interpreted, leads to a perspective on the matter of justification that takes seriously empirical findings regarding currently held normative beliefs of people. I will finally outline some functions that empirical studies might have in political philosophy."
10.1515/auk-2008-0208,Two Approaches to Shared Intention: An Essay in the Philosophy of Social Phenomena,"AbstractDrawing on earlier work of the author that is both clarified and amplified here, this article explores the question: what is it for two or more people to intend to do something in the future? In short, what is it for people to share an intention? It argues for three criteria of adequacy for an account of shared intention (the disjunction, concurrence, and obligation criteria) and offers an account that satisfies them. According to this account, in technical terms explained in the paper, people share an intention when and only when they are jointly committed to intend as a body to do such-and-such in the future. This account is compared and contrasted with the common approach that treats shared intention as a matter of the correlative personal intentions, with particular reference to the work of Michael Bratman."
10.1515/auk-2009-0202,Experimental Philosophy Is Here to Stay,"AbstractExperimental philosophy is comprised of two broad projects, the negative project and the positive project, each of which is a response to a kind of armchair use of intuitions. I examine two examples of the negative project-the analysis of knowledge and the theory of reference-and two examples of the positive project-free will and intentional action-and review criticisms of each example. I show how the criticisms can be met and argue that even if they could not have been met, experimental philosophy raises important questions about methodology, opening the door on new questions and new ways of looking at old questions. For that reason, experimental philosophy as a movement is robust and full of potential."
10.1515/ordo-2006-0103,Evolution and Emergence in Hayek’s Social Philosophy,"SummaryHayek spoke of the “errors of sociobiology” though he was very much a Darwinian. The reason is that he thought many of the institutions of the Gesellschaft could not be explained directly by conclusions drawn from the observations of animals: the market, money, or the law were not natural, nor were they rational. They emerged as novelties of cultural evolution, a process that is much faster than, and partially independent of, biological evolution. Modern man’s discontent with civilisation can only be explained by that unnatural character of many of its institutions. These conclusions of Hayek′s are being confirmed by the latest developments of evolutionary psychology, starting with Dawkin’s The Selfish Gene."
10.1515/ordo-2010-0107,Warum sich Ökonomen (wieder) mit Philosophie beschäftigen sollten – und Philosophen (wieder) mit Ökonomie / Why Economists should be more interested in Philosophy (again) – and why Philosophers should have a look at Economics (again),"ZusammenfassungDie gegenwärtige Finanz- und Wirtschaftskrise hat zu einer tiefen Grundlagen- und Orientierungskrise der Volkswirtschaftslehre geführt. Zur krisenhaften Entwicklung hat zweifelsohne die seit geraumer Zeit bestehende Sprachlosigkeit zwischen Ökonomik und Philosophie beigetragen. Die philosophischen Hintergründe, Voraussetzungen aber auch Erblasten der Ökonomik werden von dieser unbefragt hingenommen. Der Essay möchte Argumente dafür liefern, dass allemal gute Gründe für die Wiederverknüpfung gerissener Fäden bestehen."
10.1515/auk-2007-0101,The Philosophy and Neuroscience Movement,"AbstractA movement dedicated to applying neuroscience to traditional philosophical problems and using philosophical methods to illuminate issues in neuroscience began about twenty-five years ago. Results in neuroscience have affected how we see traditional areas of philosophical concern such as perception, belief-formation, and consciousness. There is an interesting interaction between some of the distinctive features of neuroscience and important general issues in the philosophy of science. And recent neuroscience has thrown up a few conceptual issues that philosophers are perhaps best trained to deal with. After sketching the history of the movement, we explore the relationships between neuroscience and philosophy and introduce some of the specific issues that have arisen."
10.4102/ve.v35i1.811,"Speculation, philosophy and the end of religion: Save the name 'God' and the folly of this name as the queen of the sciences or the jester of academia","In this article, Meillassoux and Laruelle were brought into conversation with Derrida concerning contingency, temporality, non-philosophy and God. The conversation between Derrida and Meillassoux focused on their respective views on trace and radical contingency, which opened towards reflections on God as either divinology (Meillassoux) or the endless desertification of language (Derrida), thus saving the name �God� and keeping the name safe. One cannot think this desertification of language, �God�, without a reflection on khōra. This opened a conversational space with Laruelle�s non-philosophy. One of the major criticisms against Laruelle is that his non-philosophy has no worth in terms of the extra-philosophical (ethical, political or juridical) and the same could be said with regards to khōra and, specifically, Derrida�s interpretation of khōra. Therefore Derrida�s interpretation of khōra with its �unilateral� relation to logos, the giving and receiving of khōra without giving and receiving anything and thus remaining indifferent, were brought into conversation with Laruelle�s unilateral duality. This unilateral duality, although indifferent to philosophy, makes all the difference to logos and thus to philosophy. The question is: what place is given to khōra and/or non-philosophy within academia? Derrida�s God can be interpreted as a kind of autodeconstructive divine violence or holy folly. What place is given to divine violence or holy folly within academia? What is the relation of non-philosophy to philosophy? Is it the non-foundational foundation that remains totally indifferent to philosophy as it does not engage in a dialectical relationship with philosophy and yet it is the theory or science of philosophy? Can academia afford to �give place� to this holy folly, this non-philosophy, this khōratic theo-logic, but on the other hand, can it afford not to �give place� to the queen and/or jester of academia?"
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199731596.013.044,Rhetoric and Philosophy,"The once standard account of rhetoric’s relation to philosophy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was that philosophy rejected eloquence as an instrument of deceit and a source of error, and rhetoric accepted the standards of the new philosophy, placing a premium on perspicuity and probable arguments. This account has been complicated, in recent scholarship, by three counter-claims. First, empiricist philosophers like David Hume and John Locke, far from precluding eloquence, employ the tropes of rhetoric not only in their style but, more fundamentally, in their very science of mind, depicting perception and belief as processes involving transference and persuasion. Second, philosophers sometimes admired the figurative eloquence of earlier eras. Third, philosophers and rhetoricians sought to account for the origins of tropes in their speculative histories of primitive culture, with an understanding that the underlying passions that motivate primitive and irrational beliefs are ineradicable elements of human nature."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195335828.013.020,Spinoza and the Philosophy of Science,"This chapter argues that the standard conception of Spinoza as a fellow-traveling mechanical philosopher and proto-scientific naturalist is misleading.1 It argues, first, that Spinoza’s account of the proper method for the study of nature presented in the Theological-Political Treatise points away from the one commonly associated with the mechanical philosophy. Moreover, throughout his works Spinoza’s views on the very possibility of knowledge of nature are decidedly skeptical. Third, in the seventeenth-century debates over proper methods in the sciences, Spinoza sided with those who criticized the aspirations of the physico-mathematicians like Galileo, Huygens, Wallis, and Wren who thought the application of mathematics to nature was the way to make progress. In particular, he offers grounds for doubting their confidence in the significance of measurement as well as their piecemeal methodology. Along the way, this chapter offers a new interpretation of common notions in the context of treating Spinoza’s account of motion."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199696703.013.022,Theology Engages With Avicennan Philosophy,"This chapter discusses two books of refutation written by two Muslim theologians, the Ashʿarite al-Ghazālī (d. 505/1111) and the Muʿtazilite Ibn al-Malāḥimī (d. 536/1141). Both books aim at refuting teachings of the Muslimfalāsifa, here understood as the Aristotelian tradition in Islam, represented by al-Farābī (d. 339/950–1) and Ibn Sīnā (d. 428/1037). While Ibn al-Malāḥimī in hisTuḥfat al-mutakallimīnaims at a straightforward rejection of most of the teachings of this group and includes arguments in favour of Muʿtazilite positions, al-Ghazālī’s strategy is more complex. In hisTahāfut al-falāsifahe aims to invalidate thefalāsifa’s claim of having demonstrated their teachings in metaphysics. Showing that these teachings are not supported by valid demonstrations allows al-Ghazālī to refute them wherever he thinks they violate revelation and adopt them, on basis of the authority of revelation, wherever he thinks they are true."
10.24234/wisdom.v9i2.185,The Paradox of Gödel’s Numbering and the Philosophy of Modern Metamathematics,The author of this article critically analyses the proof of Gödel’s famous theorem on the incompleteness of formalized arithmetic. It is shown that Gödel’s formalization of meta-mathematics provides a proof of the incompleteness not of mathematical science but of the system of formalized meta-mathematics developed by Gödel himself. The arguments against the idea of the formalization of meta-mathematics are presented. The article suggests also an interpretation of the essence of mathematical truth. It is noted that the refutation of Gödel’s proof does not suggest returning to Hilbert’s program of formalism since the formalization of an axiomatic theory can’t exclude the appearance of paradoxes within its framework. It is shown that the use of self-referential Gödel’s numbering in a formalized system leads to the emergence of a Liar type paradox – a self-contradic­tory formula that demonstrates the inconsistency of that same system.
10.24234/wisdom.v9i2.188,Can There Be a Credible Philosophy of History?,"A lot of different historical issues were discussed during many centuries. As a result, the philosophy of history was established as an independent academic discipline. However, nowadays there are so many philosophies of history that we have to ask ourselves where this development leads us to, and whether they have anything positive to give to science. The question is as follows: “Can there be a credible philosophy of history?”. Nevertheless, we still need to find out the significance of its credibility. To perform this task, we need to examine the very concept of the philosophy of history and to study the history of the philosophy of history."

The emergence of philosophy – the longing for wisdom – in Ancient Greece as the historical point of formation of human rational reasoning. The formation of the ideal of kalokagathia – the art of fine speeches – as the main factor that initiated studia humaniora in Roman culture and the tradition of humanities in present days. The Greek language and literature as carriers of wisdom of Antic world that gave birth to Neoplatonism and Christian philosophy and mysticism. The rehabilitation of Aristotle’s Organon as the way to Neohellenic philosophy and the advent of the European Renaissance. Greek philosophy becoming an inseparable part of humanities in modern times.

10.4102/ve.v37i1.1488,"Sensing a 'second coming': An overview of new concepts in Sociology, Philosophy, Law and Theology on the re-emerging religious in private and public life","In a number of academic disciplines, expression has been given to the recently rising awareness that the category of the religious has not disappeared from public life. What the �masters of suspicion� � Feuerbach, Marx, Nietzsche, Weber, Durkheim and Freud � had sensed was the intellectual spirit of their times and not the dawning of a broadly post-religious phase in Western/ised humanity. In different academic disciplines, this new awareness has been given expression to by means of a series of newly developed concepts. In this contribution, these developments are briefly tracked as they relate to one another. Although these formulations and discussions in some ways correspond to one another, it has not yet been undertaken to relate them to one another, which is the contribution of this article: these developments reflect, as largely parallel expressions, the recently rising awareness that the category of the religious is currently present in private and public life more so than in previous decades.Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This article traces recent developments in Sociology, Philosophy, Law and Theology on the unfolding place of religion in the world currently, as a first step to bringing these disciplines into discussion with one another on this matter.Keywords: Religiosity; Post-secularism; Sociology; Philisophy; Law; Theology"

About 30 years after he wrote his great and fascinating Sources of the Self, Taylor closes the gap between the self as a radical being-in-the-world and its analytical premises. Even if the main topic of Taylor’s new book may seem to be only a comparison of what he calls ‘HHH-theory’ and ‘HLC-theory,’ there are two other authors, the combination of whose ideas clarifies not only his approach to language but also to his concept of ‘reality’ as such: Gottlob Frege and Ludwig Wittgenstein."

10.24926/ijps.v2i2.113,Community-Based Philosophy and Dialogue: Advancing a New Understanding of the Planner-Community Relationship,"The relationship between the planner and community in a community-based project is a well-documented concern. Often noted is the need for grassroots work to be carried out ‘with,’ rather than ‘on’ or ‘for,’ a community. Although this notion implies partnership, how the planner-community relationship is conceived depends largely on how the community is defined. From a community-based perspective, action is critical to the development of a community’s identity. This outlook suggests that participation determines community membership. Accordingly, conventional community limits may be transformed. The purpose of this article is to offer an understanding of how community-based planners may be viewed to be community members. The focus is the various perspectives on community and their respective implications for membership. To begin, the traditional perspective of community that is grounded in realism is presented. A community-based outlook based on participation is then provided. Subsequently recognized is the importance of dialogue, which is an underdeveloped and, at times, overlooked strategy in community-based practice. The connection between the planner and community is later described, followed by an examination of the issue of power. To conclude, an emphasis is placed on the possibility for a planner to become a community member when a project follows community-based philosophy."

The child nurturing and rearing practices are in a degree enlightening and supplementing the existing literature in education. Prevention with the inspiration from time-tested lessons of philosophy drawn from Judaism and psychology theory could bring about a marked positive impact on child rearing. Three cornerstone principles of Jewish living—moderation, celebration and sanctification are frames of reference in developing philosophy of cultivating children. Moderation helps achieve the balance between what parents ought to do and what they should let go and tells priorities and values that make peace of mind accessible in the materialistic, anxious and highly competitive world. Gratitude is the most valuable character trait children need, for being grateful and celebrating what they are granted by life, they will always see the most beautiful world and stay with the most peaceful mind, both of which are essential to the pleasure of life. Sanctification indicates that all daily enterprises are holy and therefore demand devotion and commitment.&lt;/p&gt;"

It examines major historiographical trends in Germany from the beginnings of history as an academic discipline in the nineteenth century to the present: the anti-democratic, nationalist tradition with its focus on politics and diplomacy associated with Historismus, which dominated German historical writing until after World War II, the democratically and socially oriented “historical social science” (Historische Sozialwissennschaft) of the 1960s and 1970s, committed to the analysis of social structures and historical processes, and the “history of everyday life” (Alltagsgeschichte) which aimed at a “history from below”. Yet what made analytic philosophy unacceptable to all these trends was that it proceeded in an abstract logical manner which neglected the concrete context in which historical explanation takes place.Key WordsRanke, Droysen, Meinecke, Abusch, Wehler, Historismus, Historische Sozialgeschichte, Alltagsgeschichte.ResumenEste artículo es una respuesta a la pregunta de por qué la filosofía analítica, que ha dominado las Facultades de Filosofía en el mundo angloparlante, no ha ejercido practicamente ninguna influencia en el pensamiento histórico y en la historiografía alemanas. Se examinan las principales corrientes historiográficas alemanas desde los comienzos de la Historia como disciplina académica en el siglo XIX hasta la actualidad: la tradición antidemocrática y nacionalista, centrada en la política y la diplomacia, asociada al Historicismo (Historismus), que dominó la historiografía germana hasta después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial; la “historia-ciencia social”, orientada social y democráticamente (Historische Sozialwissennschaft), de las décadas de los sesenta y setenta del siglo XX, comprometida con el análisis de las estructuras sociales y los procesos históricos; y la “historia de los cotidiano” (Alltagsgeschichte) dirigida a la “historia desde abajo”. Sin embargo, lo que hizo inaceptable la filosofía analítica a todas estas corrientes fue el hecho de que aquella procedía de uno modo lógico-abstracto, desatendiendo el contexto concreto en el que tienen lugar las explicaciones históricas.Palabras claveRanke, Droysen, Meinecke, Abusch, Wehler, Historicismo, Historia-ciencia social, historia de lo cotidiano. "
10.1017/s0017816017000426,"Judaism, Philosophy, and the Idea of the West","In contemporary social and political discourse, the concept of “the West” plays a role that is both centrally important and difficult to define. It is most frequently used to designate an entire civilization, in a way that does not quite map onto what is suggested by its first dictionary meaning as a cardinal direction. Deciding what exactly is and is not included under the umbrella of the West, or whether the term usefully describes anything at all, is a daunting normative task involving a series of discrete historical and definitional judgments. For example, is the West defined more by medieval Christendom, or by the subsequent intellectual and spiritual movements that attacked it, such as the Renaissance, Reformation, and Enlightenment? Is it possible or coherent to include all these conflicting movements under the same designation? Geographically, how important is the ancient split between the Latin and Orthodox churches, and does the Cold War-era exclusion of Russia from the West still hold today? Champions of the concept see defending it and the values it stands for as the foremost ideological task of our time, while critics suspect it of being little more than a portentous tribal designation for societies whose heritage happens to be both majority-Christian and majority-white."

10.1192/apt.bp.116.016345,"The role of faith in mental healthcare: Philosophy, psychology and practice","Summary
            It is time to improve clinical approaches to faith in mental healthcare, particularly in psychotherapy. Understood as a psychological trait, faith has potentially great personal salience and introduces socially desirable biases into human reasoning. Therapies may have faith-informed components, either explicitly, or (as with some forms of mindfulness) implicitly, which may modify the patient's faith as well as producing symptomatic change. In this narrative review, the ethics of faith's inclusion in therapy is briefly appraised. The psychology of faith is discussed, and a model of the influence of the practitioner's faith on therapeutic choice is presented. Finally, faith-informed approaches to practice, including their impact on therapeutic effectiveness, are considered and recommendations made for their optimal implementation.
            
               LEARNING OBJECTIVES
               • Understand the main types, characteristics and likely effectiveness of faith-informed therapies versus their secular equivalents
               • Develop a framework for effective assessment of the contribution of faith to a patient's quality of life, and use this to balance the advantages and risks of employing a faith-informed therapy
               • Be aware of the unavoidability of bias in the assessment of faith, and learn how to minimise this bias, if necessary by making a group decision

Stoker’s (1899–1993) approach towards the elaboration of a Christian philosophy,"In this article it is argued that the Calvinistic philosopher, Hendrik Gerhardus Stoker (1899–1993), adopted a qualified theology-based approach for the elaboration of his Christian philosophy. Being shaped by the nature-super-nature theme, which itself is a method of synthesis, this approach lends itself towards establishing pseudo congruency. In Stoker’s case, it is an attempt to reconcile his commitment to an integral Christian philosophy with his antecedent allegiance to reformed theology in its orthodox scholastic expression. Indeed, Stoker has gone further than his reformed predecessors in an effort to develop a Calvinistic philosophy. But, instead of piecemeal adjustments, it is proposed that the theology-based approach should be rejected in its entirety if integral Christian scholarship is to flourish.H.G.

10.1515/jeeh-2013-0015,"Ethics, Market, and the Federal Order. The Political Philosophy of Wilhelm Röpke","AbstractThe moral and political philosophy of Wilhelm Röpke is among the finest instances of European classical liberalism in the twentieth century, and in many occasions he stated that only a society which understands the importance of markets can be reconciled with human dignity. Röpke elaborated a political theory that focused on the harmony between moral principles and economic law. In this sense, his liberalism is unique not only because it defends private property and competition as pillars of a thriving economy, but above all that it provides the preconditions of a society that can remain secure from the immorality of despotism and subsequent ethical degeneration. To that end he upheld an economic order based on voluntary cooperation as the basis for a more humane society, emphasizing the role of institutional competition and federalism. Röpke’s cultural conservatism should not therefore be misunderstood, as it is very much connected with his defense of the essential role of property. It is only in this sense that he found in liberal humanism a third way, which is not however situated halfway between the market and socialism, but which represents instead a defense of a competitive society that is aware of its own historical and cultural basis."

Intellectually, it underpins his relationship to the classical culture that he inherited from Renaissance humanism. And it binds the philosophical enterprise to the mutability and fragility of the body in ways that are strikingly modern."

This involves a wide-ranging exploration of historical, methodological and definitional dilemmas such as: What is a ‘book’ and what place did books occupy in eighteenth-century culture? What sorts of printed texts were influential in the final years of the ancien régime and during the Revolution? Who read them and how did they understand and respond to them? And how do the answers to these questions revise understandings of the links between French enlightenment and Revolution?"

10.1093/oso/9780190272654.003.0010,Criminal Law Philosophy in William Schabas’s Scholarship,This chapter examines the deontological and consequentialist strains in William Schabas’s scholarship in an effort to illuminate the role that criminal law philosophy plays in much of the international criminal law scholarship. The first section analyses Schabas’s writings on the question of what crimes should be considered international. Schabas’s answer to this question rests heavily on his concern that crimes committed pursuant to a state plan or policy will likely go unpunished if they are not prosecuted at international courts—a consequentialist approach. The second section of the chapter addresses Schabas’s views on which cases international courts should prosecute from among the many cases within their jurisdictions. Schabas approaches this question from a decidedly deontological perspective. This mix of consequentialist and deontological thinking is typical of international criminal law scholarship.
10.1017/eac.2013.4,PROMOTING ACTION IN WARRING STATES POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY: A FIRST LOOK AT THE CHU MANUSCRIPT CAO MIE'S BATTLE ARRAYS,"Abstract
            Recent excavations of Chinese bamboo manuscripts have so far yielded a wealth of information about classical philosophical debates, but conspicuously absent have been contemporary manuscript copies of texts on the most prevalent socio-political issue of the aptly named Warring States Period, namely warfare. Recently, however, the Shanghai Museum began publishing several Warring States bamboo manuscripts from the kingdom of Chu, which it acquired in 1994. Among them is the manuscript of a previously unknown Warring States text titled Cao Mie's Battle Arrays. Through a lengthy dialogue between Duke Zhuang of Lu and his advisor Cao Mie, this manuscript offers new insight into statecraft methods designed to ensure the viability of a small kingdom surrounded by larger bellicose neighbors. While many contemporary philosophical schools considered the welfare of a kingdom or army to be linked to the power of both virtue and the will of Heaven, Cao Mie gives precedence to the real-world efficacy of the ruler's actions and the subsequent response of the populace and soldiers.

10.5539/ass.v12n7p136,Sufficiency Economy Philosophy: A Holistic Approach to Economic Development and Mainstream Economic Thought,"&lt;p&gt;The theories of mainstream economics have been criticised for triggering periodic crises and fluctuations, as well as causing resource depletion and environmental degradation. Also, they are accused of worsening the problems of poverty and income distribution, while ignoring the well-being of people and social issues. The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, bestowed by His Majesty, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, for Thai people in 1997 as a tool to cope with economic adversity, is an alternative way of viewing development. The essence of the Philosophy is that people should act with due consideration, and in moderation. The Philosophy emphasizes moral behaviour by people and society, which mainstream economic thought lacks. Incorporating such human behaviours as moderation and morality into economic decision making is sensible and yields different outcomes from the typical economic framework. Moderation serves as a tool to filter out greed and consumerist behaviour. Morality leads an individual to consider the consequence of his/her actions to others and to society. Together with the reasonableness concept implying non-excessive risk taking behaviour, under the Philosophy an economy will have reduced economic fluctuations, less likelihood of an economic crisis, and sustained quality growth. The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy will make its mark in the economic development arena as an alternative thought system that works for the people and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;"
10.1093/oso/9780198748991.003.0002,Reviving the Philosophy of Geometry,"In the Anglophone world, the philosophical treatment of geometry has fallen on hard times. This chapter argues that philosophy can come to a better understanding of mathematics by providing an account of modern geometry, including its development of new forms of space, both for mathematical physics and for arithmetic. It returns to the discussions of Weyl and Cassirer on geometry whose concerns are very much relevant today. A way of encompassing a great part of modern geometry via homotopy toposes is discussed, along with the `cohesive’ variant of their internal language, known as `homotopy type theory’. With these tools in place, we can now start to see what an adequate philosophical account of current geometry might look like."
10.1093/oso/9780198757405.003.0017,Postscript: Philosophy Without Borders,"This postscript discusses the nature and ambitions of cross-cultural philosophy. It distinguishes cross-cultural philosophy from an older project of comparative philosophy, and argues that philosophy should be a cosmopolitan undertaking. A cross-cultural philosophy claims that it is methodologically essential to consider theories from a plurality of cultural locations if one’s ambition is to discover a fundamental theory true of the human mind as such. So philosophy should be ‘borderless’, straddling geographical and cultural divisions. To think across cultures and languages is somewhat akin to perceiving with two eyes rather one, in that one gains a depth of vision not available in monocular sight."
10.4102/td.v10i1.12,Michel Serres’ multidisciplinary philosophy of information and  knowledge,"This paper is a tribute to the formidable multidisciplinary philosophy of information of the French philosopher, Michel Serres. His approach is to an extent based on his statement: “Let us nevertheless try to see on a grand scale, to enjoy a multiple, and by times connective, intellection”. His main focus is on the notion of intellection which can be related to human spirituality, perception, understanding and comprehension. This human quality is urgently required if we want to reflect on knowledge as a multiple phenomenon. His view of knowledge differs in a substantial way from currently held views on knowledge and information and hence his plea: Let the new knowledge come. The human quality of intellection is equally important when it is realised that the phenomenon of knowledge in its multiplicity can only be properly grasped when viewed from the perspective of the extensive transdisciplinary connectiveness between knowledges, which creates room for what can significantly be called the world-mapping of knowledge and which strongly suggests the spatial character of knowledge and information. Thanks to the quality and capacity of intellection it becomes possible to demonstrate certain deeply theoretical and immensely practical issues in the embracement of the idea of a new conception of knowledge."
10.4102/td.v5i2.135,"Exploring Interdisciplinarity: a theoretical consideration of Bioethics at the  interface between Theology, Philosophy and Life Sciences","Complex ethical problems resulting from research and advances in biotechnologies increasingly confront Christian ministers and theologians with difficult and complex moral dilemmas. Where do they turn to in order to give guidance and answer questions concerning practical bioethical problems? This article argues that Bioethics as the systematic study of specific moral dilemmas implies conjoining a variety of ethical methodologies in an interdisciplinary framework. In trying to clarify this complex nature of Bioethics when practiced specifically from a Christian Theological viewpoint, the article examines theoretical considerations regarding the interface between three contributing disciplines, viz. Theology, Philosophy and Life Sciences. This is done by investigating three questions: What is the place of Bioethics in the hierarchy of disciplines? In what way do Philosophy, Theology, and Life Sciences contribute to the theoretical foundations of interdisciplinary Bioethics?, and How do different methodologies relate to one another in order to show the true interdisciplinary character of Bioethics? The article concludes that it is vital to re-examine the theoretical basis of Bioethics as a philosophical grounding or methodology in order to place moral knowledge within a meta-theoretical and epistemological framework. It is clear that Bioethics is a complex endeavour served by many disciplines, as well as a complex interdisciplinary form of knowledge. Scholars, scientists and theologians must all learn to transcend the barriers between the multitude of interrogational disciplines and endeavour to work towards designing a well- founded and meaningful framework within which the methodological assumptions and theoretical grounding have been clarified, and one which also recognizes the complex interdisciplinary nature of Bioethics."
10.4102/td.v3i1.317,From hauntology to a new animism? Nature and culture in Heinz Kimmerle’s intercultural philosophy,"Derrida has proposed a new spectrology in an attempt to deal with the ghost of Marx. Kimmerle shows that Marx has forgotten nature, and enquires about Derrida’s forgetting Marx’s forgetting. With specific reference to African culture he asks whether a new animism should not be explored within the framework of a new spectrology. Derrida uses the concept animism, but not in terms of the being of things in and ofthemselves, which could positively be thought as animated. Kimmerle proposes a way in which Western philosophy could be opened to African philosophy in order to understand the problem of animated nature more adequately. African philosophy has a concept of the universe of spiritual forces, in which nature and its powers arecompletely integrated. This paper explores these issues in dialogue with a number of African philosophers, while linking them to certain contestations within environmental philosophy and ethics, especially Murray Bookchin’s critique of spirit-talk in Deep Ecology. Kimmerle’s work on the relationship between Africa and Hegel sets the scenefor an elaboration of his re-evaluation of animism which is compared to the groundbreaking hypothesis of Bird-David. A relational epistemology is understood in ethical terms, and it is implied that such an epistemology would be more adequate for a new humanism that would be new in going beyond the western tradition, and in the processgain a more inclusive concept of “person” and “community”."
10.4102/td.v3i2.328,‘Music is Life’ – The influence of transcendentalist philosophy on Ives’s Concord Sonata,"Although the Concord Sonata is traditionally regarded as a sonata, it is atypical of the genre and is often considered as enigmatic. To understand this composition, a transdisciplinary approach is essential by, more specifically, incorporating knowledge of the philosophies of Transcendentalist authors Emerson, Hawthorne, the Alcotts andThoreau. Charles Ives set out the Transcendentalist ideas which influenced his conception of this piano sonata in his Essays before a sonata. His view of musical structure is based on the motto ‘Music is Life’, which he derived from their philosophy. The analysis of the first and last movements of this sonata also facilitates access to the ideas of Emerson and Thoreau. By linking the results of a musical analysis to extra-musical knowledge from literary art, this article demonstrates how abstract ideas of the Transcendental writers can be expressed through music. Interpretations arrived at in this manner help to promote a better understanding of the work as a whole. This essay shows how mediating between two different fields of knowledge and between knowledge and understanding as complementary concepts can enhance understanding and therefore appreciation of the music."
10.4102/td.v3i1.321,Transdisciplinary research in the cooperation between intercultural philosophy and empirical sciences,"This article will examine how philosophy and empirical sciences can cooperate in research. It is presupposed that in philosophy and in the empirical sciences different types of discourses are used. This difference causes a large gap between them, which has to be bridged. Intercultural philosophy is understood as a specific approach to philosophy as a whole. It is necessary to make philosophy fit into a world in which exchanges are happening on a global level in many fields. In the dialogues between the philosophies of different cultures, support is needed from certain empirical sciences for the understanding of the philosophy, which is based on the the participation of philosophers in everyday life and everyday language. Therefore, in addition to the the support by empirical sciences, living in a foreign culture, participating in its life, is necessary for intercultural philosophers."
10.1093/oso/9780198805281.003.0003,Attuning Philosophy and Literary Criticism,"Are philosophy and literary criticism forms of discourse with incommensurate aims and interests, or can they learn from each other? Max de Gaynesford addresses this question by exploring what it means to respond adequately to In the Heart of the Country (1977), one of Coetzee’s earlier fictions. Distinguishing between the procedures of philosophical analysis and literary criticism, de Gaynesford argues that the force of Coetzee’s metafictional approach in this text, which not only portrays literary characters but also stages the very question of what a character is, calls for philosophy and literary criticism to attune themselves to each other, to learn from each other’s distinctive modes of attention. And along the way, de Gaynesford’s chapter itself offers an exemplary act of such attunement, focusing particularly on issues like integrity and the use of brackets."

We collect here new and refereed work by leaders in the field. Authors in this volume are Zofia Stemplowska and Adam Swift, Thomas Sinclair, Allen Buchanan, Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen, Zoltan Miklosi, Ralf M. Bader, Alex Voorhoeve, and Alex Zakaras. The chapters are grouped into three categories: Legitimacy, Egalitarianism, and Liberty and Coercion. They address such various themes as the interaction of justice, equality, and political legitimacy; difficulties in the Kantian account of the state and proposals for removing them; institutional legitimacy reevaluated; luck egalitarianism; relational egalitarianism; the nature of liberty; mandatory health insurance and at what level it might best benefit a population; and the issue of citizens’ complicity in their government’s immoral actions with an analysis of various levels of such possible complicity."
10.1093/oso/9780198815655.001.0001,Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy,"Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy provides, twice each year, a collection of the best current work in the field of ancient philosophy. Each volume features original essays that contribute to an understanding of a wide range of themes and problems in all periods of ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, from the beginnings to the threshold of the Middle Ages. From its first volume in 1983, OSAP has been a highly influential venue for work in the field, and has often featured essays of substantial length as well as critical essays on books of distinctive importance. Volume LIII contains: an article on several of Zeno of Elea’s paradoxes and the nihilist interpretation of Eudemus of Rhodes; an article on the coherence of Thrasymachus’ challenge in Plato’s Republic book 1; another on Plato’s treatment of perceptual content in the Theaetetus and the Phaedo; an article on why Aristotle thinks that hypotheses are material causes of conclusions, and another on why he denies shame is a virtue; and a book review of a new edition of a work possibly by Apuleius and Middle Platonist political philosophy."
10.1093/oso/9780198815655.003.0006,Plato Systematized: Doing Philosophy In The Imperial Schools,"The paper is an examination of an anonymous Latin text, which has been tentatively attributed by its editor, Justin A. Stover, to Apuleius. This text contains the summaries of several of Plato’s dialogues, but its proper function seems to be the identification of the main doctrines that constitute his philosophical system. Clearly it is a typical school product, whose content belongs to Middle Platonism. But it also presents some interesting and distinctive features. Particularly noteworthy is the heavy presence of Stoic terms and doctrines and the emphasis on Plato’s political philosophy. These can be paralleled with what we read in Apuleius’ De Platone et eius dogmate. At the same time there are also some important differences which complicate the hypothesis of Apuleian authorship."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199567942.013.031,Positivist and Post-Positivist Philosophy of Science,"Interactions between archaeology and philosophy are traced, from the ‘New Archaeology’s’ use of ideas from logical empiricism, the subsequent loss of confidence in such ideas, the falsificationist alternative, the rise of ‘scientific realism’, and the influence of the ‘new’ philosophies of science of the 1960s on post-processual archaeology. Some recent ideas from philosophy of science are introduced, and that discipline’s recent trajectory, featuring debate between realists and anti-realists, as well as a return to ‘classic’ concerns about explanation, causation, and laws of nature, is described. Many interactions between philosophy of science and archaeology have been based on a misplaced quest for a single ‘off-the-peg’ methodology or other philosophical framework for archaeology. Historical conditions have fostered the damaging idea that archaeologists have to choose between ‘positivism’ and subjectivism. I conclude by suggesting what kinds of contemporary philosophical work might interest archaeologists, and argue that philosophers should recognize the distinctive heterogeneity of archaeology."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195370935.013.001,Musical Improvisation and the Philosophy of Music,"This chapter argues that the prevailing orienting concepts and tenets of contemporary philosophy of music—the centrality of aesthetic objects, the assumption of the mono-functionality of music, the paradigm of European classical music, and the spectatorialist perspective—do not provide the basis for an adequate understanding of musical improvisation. The essays calls for a more robust philosophical consideration of the gamut of improvisational activity, including the aesthetic aspects of musical improvisation, the range of musical and social skills made manifest by improvisers, and the deeper social meanings of the practice, including the implicit reference to human freedom and situated meanings that arise from the national, ethnic, racial, gendered, and socio-economic contexts in which the music arises. Such a view would be theoretically nuanced, empirically informed, phenomenologically sensitive, and ineliminably indexed to the manifold ways in which improvised music situates itself in the complex of human affairs."

While AWH already initiated educational reform for Pesantren (boarding schools) oriented on ideal hereafter and mundane pragmatic. Islamic education which was formerly monopolized by traditional educational institutions and the students who could not think freely were reviewed by AWH through encouraging his students to think more openly and free yet carry on proper obedient to the teachers. The analysis was conducted through data reduction, display, and data verification. According to AWH, human is perfect being consists of physical and spiritual components and homo educandus capable of thinking, feeling and reasoning spiritually. The perfectness can be achieved through education by developing the potential and thinking skills, physical skills strengthened by faith. Pesantren educational reformations are (1) the foundation of pesantren education are Ilahiyah verses (Al-Qur’an and Sunnah) and kauniyah (the evidence of God’s existence appeared in natural laws, the system of universe); (2) The purpose of pesantren education is to shape human to be virtuous being accompanied with developed thinking skills, piety to Allah, and equipped with life skills. This, is actually in accordance with contemporary educational thought which covers cognitive, affective, spiritual and psychomotor aspects; (3) the curriculum of pesantren education should balance between practical life and ideal life, that is between religious sciences and secular sciences; (4) the teaching methods applied in pesantren are traditional methods such as sorogan and bandongan, as well as modern methods such as experiment, tutorial, and mudzakarah (discussions nad seminars); (5) learning resources such as library constitutes the heart of scientific life in pesantren, which was distinctively remarkable in AWH’s era. Factors influencing AWH’s thoughts are his own personal learning, the burgeoning thoughts proliferating during his era, social-cultural environment, educational background, his own intelligence, and support from policy makers, particularly his own family."
10.1515/nietzstu-2017-0108,Love of the Sexes in Nietzsche’s Philosophy: From Opposition to transformative Interaction,AbstractNietzsche discusses the emotional level of the love of the sexes in aphorism 363 of The Gay Science where he claims that men and women have different prejudices about love. The basic dynamics of love in GS 363 are explained in terms of the woman who gives herself and the man who takes. How can this model offer more than a reactionary idea of an opposition of a submissive woman and dominating man? It will be argued that a deeper understanding of giving oneself and taking does not warrant an opposition in the sense of a master-slave relation. The preconditions for giving and taking in Nietzsche’s philosophy disclose a richer idea of giving and taking as a dynamic and mutually transformative interaction of partners in love.

10.3366/edinburgh/9781474412094.003.0002,The Muses and Philosophy: Elements for a History of the Pseudos [1991],"Barbara Cassin’s “The Muses and Philosophy: Elements for a History of the ‘Pseudos’” (1991; translated by Samuel Galson), investigates Plato’s attempt in the Sophist to distinguish the philosopher from the sophist. Cassin pinpoints the slippery operation of the pseudos through the texts of Parmenides and Hesiod. Yet Parmenides’ rejection of not-being allows the sophist to claim infallibility. Plato’s Eleatic Stranger shows that Parmenides’ rejection of not-being is self-refuting (thus the Stranger’s famous parricide is just as much Parmenides’ suicide). Further, although the Stranger ultimately fails to find a criterion for truth or falsity, he nevertheless establishes a place for the pseudos in the distinction between logos tinos (speech of something) and logos peri tinos (speech about something). Ultimately, Cassin argues that reality of pseudos is a condition for the possibility of language, and indeed involves the very materiality and breadth of language."

B.R.AMBEDKAR’S PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE ON INDIAN SOCIETY,"The process of democratization from below has threatened the very existence of the caste system and the dominance of the traditionally powerful groups. We are now witnessing such momentous historic developments in the social system in India. It is in this historic perspectives, more and more sections of people are discovering the relevance and importance of the ideology of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, who put forward scientific analysis of the caste system, the Hindu religion had evolved ways and means to fight out of the evils and degenerations, resulting into the very negation of human values and dignity. We often use the most elusive tern social justice but rarely define it as it is covered by conflicting claims of divergent approaches of divergent segments of society. Further it is a multi-contextual term having interpretations and implications in national and international spheres. The modern idea of social justice is concerned with ushering in a new social order without any border which could secure rights and advantages for the different sections of society in general and for the vulnerable and underprivileged sections of society in particular.  As whole, it is correctly that any genuine democratization process can be started in India only through social justice. For that the emancipation of the Dalits, by a restoration of self-respect, is very much needed. The vision of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar has given us a comprehensive programme for achieving social justice in India. So, it is the duty of all progressive and democratic forces to assimilate the ideology and vision of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar for the establishment of genuine social justice."
10.21225/d5jp4g,Teaching Philosophy: Moving from Face-to-Face to Online Classrooms,"This article explores the similarities and differences between Canadian and Australian university teachers’ face-to-face and online teaching approaches and philosophies. It presents perspectives on teaching face-to-face and online in two comparable Canadian and Australian universities, both of which offer instruction in these two modes. The key research question was to determine if moving from face-to-face instruction to on-line teaching results in new teaching approaches or in a creative blend of those developed within each teaching modality. Qualitative data were collected using an open-ended survey, which asked participants for their thoughts on their face-to-face (f2f) and online teaching experiences. Quantitative data were collected using the “Teaching Perspectives Inventory,” which assessed participants’ teaching approaches and philosophies in terms of their beliefs, intentions, and actions. The authors’ conclusions address the issue of assisting teachers to successfully make the transition from traditional teacher-centred to newly emerging learner-centred teaching approaches in distributed classrooms."

The teacher is a mentor, director, and educational leader in the educational process.

The respondents of the study were the 62 regularcollege faculty of the West Visayas State University-Janiuay Campus who were chosen through total enumeration.Data were gathered with the aid of a self-made philosophic inventory checklist which was validated by experts and pilot- tested. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;It utilized the descriptive design to collect, analyze and classify data on the prevailing educational philosophies of pre-service teachers.  Results showed that college facultywere likely to accept reconstructionism, behaviorism and progressivism as educational philosophies when taken as a whole and when classified according to sex, age and area of specializations. Conclusions and recommendations have been drawn at the end of this study.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"
10.1017/s0368393100077579,Design Philosophy of Man Powered Aircraft,"In 1961 I assisted Mr. G. M. Lilley in writing a survey of the design and performance of man powered aircraft. Our conclusions were that man powered flight is just possible if the aircraft is carefully designed to give excellent aerodynamic characteristics, with a stiff, light structure and flown by a pilot whose power output is comparable with that of a National Amateur Cycling Champion. Such a machine would not fly more than fifteen to twenty feet above the ground and could operate only in still air conditions. The type of aircraft which emerged from the calculations was similar in general principles to those being developed currently at Hatfield and Southampton.
            In this lecture I propose to investigate some of the basic relationships which are involved in the hope that possible ways of obtaining further improvements may emerge. Since the conclusion of our survey was that flight was marginally possible, slight improvements might well go a long way towards making man powered flight possible."

10.1515/ip-2018-0002,Pragmatics and philosophy: In search of a paradigm,"Abstract
There is no doubt that pragmatic theory and philosophy of language are mutually relevant and intrinsically connected. The main question I address in this paper is how exactly they are interconnected in terms of (i) their respective objectives, (ii) explanans – explanandum relation, (iii) methods of enquiry, and (iv) drawing on associated disciplines. In the introductory part I attempt to bring some order into the diversity of use of such labels as philosophical logic, philosophical semantics, philosophical pragmatics, linguistic philosophy, or philosophy of linguistics, among others. In the following sections I focus on philosophical pragmatics as a branch of philosophy of language (pragmaticsPPL) and the trends and theories it gave rise to, discussing them against the background of methodology of science and in particular paradigms and paradigm shifts as identified in natural science. In the main part of the paper I address the following questions:
How is pragmaticsPPL to be delimited?How do pragmatic solutions to questions about meaning fare vis-à-vis syntactic solutions? Is there a pattern emerging?and, relatedly,What are the future prospects for pragmaticsPPL in theories of natural language meaning?
I conclude with a discussion of the relation between pragmaticsPPL and functionalism, observing that contextualism has to play a central role in functionalist pragmatics at the expense of minimalism and sententialism."
10.1017/s1358246116000321,Wittgenstein and the Illusion of ‘Progress’: On Real Politics and Real Philosophy in a World of Technocracy,"Abstract‘You can’t stop progress’, we are endlessly told. But what is meant by “progress”? What is “progress”toward? We are rarely told. Human flourishing? And a culture? That would be a good start – but rarely seems a criterion for ‘progress’. (In fact,survivalwould be a good start…)Rather, ‘progress’ is simply aprocess,that we are not allowed, apparently, to stop. Or rather: it would be futile to seek to stop it. So that we are seemingly-deliberately demoralised into giving up even trying.Questioning the myth of ‘progress’, and seeking to substitute for it the idea of real progress – progress which is actuallyassessedaccording to some independent not-purely-procedural criteria – is a vital thing to do, at this point in history. Literally: life, or at least civilisation, and thus culture, may depend on it.Once we overcome the myth of ‘progress’, we can clear the ground for a real politics that would jettison the absurd hubris of liberalism and of most ‘Leftism’. And would jettison the extreme Prometheanism and lack of precaution endemic to our current pseudo-democratic technocracy. The challenge is to do so in a way that does not fall into complete pessimism or into an endorsement of the untenable and unsavoury features of conservatism. The challenge, in other words, is to generate an ideology or philosophy for our time, that might yet save us, and ensure that we are worth saving.This paper is then a kind of reading of Wittgenstein’s crucial aphorism on this topic: ‘Our civilization is characterized by the wordprogress. Progress is its form rather than making progress being one of its features.’"

10.1017/s0080454100006361,II.—The Fundamental Concepts of Natural Philosophy,"From the time of Galileo, experiment has been the core of Natural Science. Before him, of course, observation alone had in the development of astronomy played a fundamental part. Besides the great workers of the ancient civilisations, who knew the path of the sun amongst the fixed stars and could predict eclipses, and besides the fruits of Greek astronomy associated with the names of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, the more modern observational work of Tycho Brahe, analysed by Kepler, had vindicated the self-consistency of the Copernican theory of the solar system and had led to its remarkable refinement in the form of Kepler's three quantitative laws—the law of the ellipse, the law of areas, and the law connecting periodic times and major axes. This was a triumphant example of the execution of the programme then being put forward by Francis Bacon for discovering all natural laws—the method of induction from a number of instances. But it was reserved for Galileo to make a start with the process of ascertaining as far as might be, by controlled experiment, the particular nature ofmotion. Themetaphysicalquestions associated with motion had not escaped the attention of the Greeks; but Zeno was apparently content with stating paradoxes, and did not resolve them. Galileo, first, experimented with moving bodies; and established that in falling they received equal increments of velocity in equal times—a kinematic theorem, like Kepler's laws. Huyghens was perhaps the first person to establishdynamical-theorems; that is to say, to infer a kinematic result from a stated physical principle—as, for example, his proof of the approximate isochromism of the pendulum based on the principle ofvis viva, or, as we should now say, the conservation of energy. Huyghens, together with some of the early Restoration men of science in this country, dealt also with the collisions of bodies. The peerless Newton went further. Assuming outright three primitive “laws of motion,” he showed how the results of Galileo, Huyghens, and their contemporaries could be actually deduced; and by the addition of a fourth law, the law of universal gravitation, already conjectured by some thinkers, he arrived at the laws of Kepler as inferences. Not only so, but the four highly general and abstract laws introduced by Newton have been found sufficient to deduce an enormous complex of dynamical theorems, to express their relationships in the subsequent beautiful systems of Lagrange and of Hamilton, and to derive all but every detail in the motions both in the solar system and in distant binary stars. The basic principles laid down by Newton remained unaltered till our own day, when Einstein modified simultaneously the laws of motion, the law of gravitation, and the background of space and time which had been explicitly adopted by Newton as the scene in which his laws were to play their parts."
10.1017/s0841820900002939,"The Priority of Abstract Right, Constructivism, and the Possibility of Collective Rights in Hegel’s Legal Philosophy","A first task of a philosophy of law and morals is to try to make explicit and authenticate a standpoint that allows for the evaluation of things in normative terms. It cannot begin straightaway with conceptions of the right, the good or the moral worth of persons. For these are notions whose adequate elucidation presupposes that we are already occupying a standpoint which, taken by itself, is unqualifiedly normative and complete. The account of what I shall refer to as “the standpoint of the normative” is thus prior to the explication of the criteria and contents of our normative conceptions."
10.1017/s0841820900001533,"Moral Philosophy, the United States Supreme Court, and the Nation’s Character, 1860–1910","The charge that the United States Supreme Court exercised a conservative influence upon the nation’s constitutional life during the period from 1864 to 1938 is impossible to refute. The Supreme Court during the period from the end of the Civil War to the New Deal era has been portrayed as having largely abdicated its obligation to protect society’s common interests in favour of a laissez-faire constitutionalism reflecting the social and political views of new and powerful economic interests. The judicial conservatism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries conflicted with the political ideals of Progressives and with the direction taken by American policy-makers since the acceptance of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal in the 1930s. Historians have labelled the Court’s laissez-faire conservative style as undesirable, if not consciously immoral.
            Nevertheless, the problem of understanding the ideas which lay at the foundation of judicial conservatism should be addressed. General legal historians have preferred to begin and end their inquiries into early influences on the judicial mind with a short overview of legal education and leave aside the possible influence of college studies. In recent years, historians have broadened their investigations of the intellectual underpinnings of late nineteenth-century legal thought in an attempt to provide the sort of synthetic account of legal thought suggested by Perry Miller’s Life of the Mind—a work which attempts to connect the thought of leading members of the bar to intellectual currents outside the legal sphere. The result has been a limited rehabilitation of the Supreme Court’s reputation during the Gilded Age."

Viz., does the perpetrator have an excused necessity defence that negates imposing the punishment? This issue - excused necessity defence - has fascinated the legal world since antiquity and has been described as one of the most complicated issues in criminal law. The well-known case is the “plank of Carneades” or “two men and the plank”. Two men, A and B, are shipwrecked on the high seas; as their strength ebbs and they are about to drown, they see a wooden plank that is just large enough to support only one of them. A reaches the plank first and grabs it, but B, faced with the prospect of certain death, pushes A off the plank, resulting in the death of A by drowning. B then grabs the plank and manages to save his own life. Should B have a defence if he is prosecuted for pushing A off the plank in these circumstances?"
10.1017/s0362502800001486,The Duke of Zhou's Retirement in the East and the Beginnings of the Ministerial-Monarch Debate in Chinese Political Philosophy,"Virtually all Chinese historians, past and present, have viewed the Duke of Zhou as a paragon of the virtuous minister. However, in traditional Chinese sources concerning the Duke of Zhou there is also a distinct negative undercurrent, several texts recording that the Duke “resided in the east” in contexts implying that he went into a sort of exile. Given this ambivalence in the history and traditions regarding the Duke of Zhou, the author examines two chapters of the Book of Documents: the “Shao gao” or “Announcement of the Duke of Shao” and the “Jun Shi” or “Lord Shi.” He posits that these two chapters represent two sides of a debate over political theory and governance. The “Jun Shi,” a speech by the Duke of Zhou to the Duke of Shao, expounds a political theory that privileges ministers over kings. The “Shao gao,” on the other hand, is an address by the Duke of Shao to the Duke of Zhou in which the Duke of Shao resolutely supports the king's prerogative to rule as the “eldest son” of Heaven.
            This debate between the Duke of Zhou and the Duke of Shao was but the first instance of a tension that would continue to occupy statesmen and political theorists throughout Chinese history: between the power of the king or emperor and that of his ministers. While, in later times, neither side was ever able long to maintain supremacy in this debate, in the early Western Zhou the Duke of Shao almost certainly prevailed; shortly after the Duke of Shao made the address contained in the “Shao gao,” the Duke of Zhou first relinquished power to King Cheng and then, somewhat later, went into exile or retreat, never again to play a central role in Western Zhou government."
10.1017/s0263523200001208,"The French Revolutionary Roots of Political Modernity in Hegel's Philosophy, or the Enlightenment at Dusk","Readers of Auguste Comte's Cours de Philosophie positive which began to appear just before Hegel's death might well have imagined, from the work's title, that they were about to confront an interpretation of Hegel's philosophical system. If Hegel himself had assembled his writings as systematically as his doctrines, that collective title would probably have embraced their meaning with greater accuracy than any other. The positivity of Comte's philosophy was of course strikingly different from Hegel's and was in a crucial sense meant to supplant it, replacing it with a genuinely scientific understanding of society, just as metaphysics had earlier overturned theology. Over the past hundred and fifty years or so, Comte's positive philosophy – which he also termed sociology – has in its various formulations by his disciples come to encapsulate the proper agenda of the human sciences for a post-metaphysical, post-Hegelian, age."
10.1017/s026352320000286x,Evolution and Emanation of Spirit in Hegel's Philosophy of Nature,"Having studied Hegel's philosophy, as it is epitomized in the Encyclopaedia, many scholars would be in agreement with David G Ritchie who, in his book on Darwin and Hegel (1893), remarked: “Everywhere in Hegel we read about Entwickelung; but of Evolution he does not speak in so friendly a manner.” Bearing in mind the distinction between “Entwicklung” (“development”) and “evolution” and recalling Hegel's criticism of conceptions of natural evolution in the initial section of the Philosophy of Nature, it is certainly not immediately evident why a serious scholar like John N Findlay should maintain that “if any philosopher is a philosopher of evolution, that philosopher is Hegel.”
            It can hardly be denied, however, that more recent studies in Hegel's philosophy can be used to support Findlay's statement to a certain extent. Not only has the relevance of Hegel's philosophy for an adequate understanding of organic life and its evolution been strongly emphasized; it has even been asserted that Hegel had at his disposal a concept of evolution essentially determining the methodic approach of his philosophy of nature.
            Now I would not venture to ascertain whether or not Hegel's concept of evolution is of present relevance for our understanding of nature and even less would I dare to decide on the hypothetical question whether or not Hegel, if he “had lived a little later, … would have given us an evolutionary, teleological theory of Nature as he did of mind in history.” In my paper, I would like to deal with a subject matter of more limited scope. Discussions concerning the systematic importance and present relevance of Hegel's concept of evolution tend to be somewhat vague and abstract as long as the meaning of “evolution” in Hegel's philosophy is anything but unequivocal. Therefore, I am going to attempt to outline a systematic reconstruction of the function of Hegel's concept of evolution within the conceptual framework of Hegel's encyclopaedic Philosophy of Nature. More precisely, I will try to elucidate: 1) the question whether or not Hegel's criticism of philosophic and scientific concepts of evolution led him to his own positive concept of evolution; 2) the question in what sense a specific Hegelian concept of evolution is relevant for the understanding of the notional development taking place between the logical “absolute Idea” and “subjective spirit”."

The purpose of this present article is to draw attention to the fact that a number of contemporary Roman Catholic theologians have begun to take the Whiteheadian-Hartshornean challenge seriously, indeed to the extent that they have felt pressed, in response, to seek and exploit implicit, latent resources within Thomas' texts in order to explicate a more adequate Thomist conception of God's interrelationship with his creatures (Section II). Process metaphysics is defended versus several criticisms raised by Roman Catholic writers (Section III)."

            Firstly, Brameld states that ‘Reeonstructionism commits itself to a building of a new culture’. In analysing the statement it can be said that Aboriginal culture and Western culture must form a new culture through the bonding of each culture. However, it must be noted that each culture will retain its values, customs and traditions, but must readily accept and try to understand the values, customs and traditions of the alternate culture. The result will be a new cultural group."

The author, inspired by the work of Professor Julian M�ller, applied Paul Tillich�s notion of love to affirm the value of pastoral counselling as a constituent practice and research focus of practical theology. The focus of the discussion was upon love as the primary witness of the church and motivating factor for offering pastoral counselling and care to those who seek it. Distinctions were drawn between psychotherapeutic counselling and pastoral counselling. M�ller�s postfoundationalist approach to listening and reflecting upon the work of pastoral counselling and valuing the counselee or co-researcher role as teacher was supported."
10.1155/2016/9510201,Optimizing Safety Stock Levels in Modular Production Systems Using Component Commonality and Group Technology Philosophy: A Study Based on Simulation,"Modular production and component commonality are two widely used strategies in the manufacturing industry to meet customers growing needs for customized products. Using these strategies, companies can enhance their performance to achieve optimal safety stock levels. Despite the importance of safety stocks in business competition, little attention has been paid to the way to reduce them without affecting the customer service levels. This paper develops a mathematical model to reduce safety stock levels in organizations that employ modular production. To construct the model, we take advantage of the benefits of aggregate inventories, standardization of components, component commonality, and Group Technology philosophy in regard to stock levels. The model is tested through the simulation of three years of operation of two modular product systems. For each system, we calculated and compared the safety stock levels for two cases: (1) under the only presence of component commonality and (2) under the presence of both component commonality and Group Technology philosophy. The results show a reduction in safety stock levels when we linked the component commonality with the Group Technology philosophy. The paper presents a discussion of the implications of each case, features of the model, and suggestions for future research."

In this article I investigate the reception of this synthesis in the late 1780s and early 1790s. I show that during this early reception Kant’s attempt at a synthesis, and its empiricist side in particular, proved to be a failure when it was confronted with a powerful challenge from the side of Gottlob Ernst Schulze, Salomon Maimon and Karl Leonhard Reinhold. This failure, I argue, resulted in a break within the Kantian movement itself between a rationalist and an empiricist Kantianism"

Is it to help us find the right path in life, with the philosopher as guide and mentor? Or is it, as D. Z. Phillips proposes, to contemplate ‘the world in all its variety’, deepening our understanding of multiple perspectives (both religious and non-religious) without trying to appropriate or reject any of them? Recognizing certain shortcomings of the former conception, this article seeks to elucidate the latter and to engage with the critical reception of Phillips's work by other Wittgenstein-influenced philosophers. Towards the end, with reference to Rush Rhees and Wittgenstein, I discuss how giving expression to ‘wonder at what is terrible’ illustrates theethical demandof a contemplative approach, and in conclusion I offer some thoughts on how this approach could usefully be enriched and extended."
10.1017/sjp.2016.54,Financial Surrogate Decision Making: Lessons from Applied Experimental Philosophy,"Abstract
            An estimated 1 in 4 elderly Americans need a surrogate to make decisions at least once in their lives. With an aging population, that number is almost certainly going to increase. This paper focuses on financial surrogate decision making. To illustrate some of the empirical and moral implications associated with financial surrogate decision making, two experiments suggest that default choice settings can predictably influence some surrogate financial decision making. Experiment 1 suggested that when making hypothetical financial decisions, surrogates tended to stay with default settings (OR = 4.37, 95% CI 1.52, 12.48). Experiment 2 replicated and extended this finding suggesting that in a different context (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.1, 4.65). Experiment 2 also suggested that those who were more numerate were less likely to be influenced by default settings than the less numerate, but only when the decision is whether to “opt in” (p = .05). These data highlight the importance of a recent debate about “nudging.” Defaults are common methods to nudge people to make desirable choices while allowing the liberty to choose otherwise. Some of the ethics of using default settings to nudge surrogate decision makers are discussed."
10.17570/stj.2015.v1n1.a3,"The revelation of Christ as an impossible impossibility: a critical reading of Jean-Luc Marion’s contribution to the post-modern debate in phenomenology, philosophy of religion and theology","This article is an attempt to establish the phenomenological and theological value of the concept of Revelation in the work of the French philosopher Jean-Luc Marion in a post-modern cultural and intellectual context. Is it possible to speak of revelation in a phenomenological sense and more radically, about the Revelation of God, after the critique of metaphysics and phenomenology by Derrida, Caputo and others? Marion argues that by overcoming metaphysics and broadening the limits of traditional phenomenology to include phenomena of Revelation, the Revelation of Christ is a phenomenological impossible impossibility. Using Marion’s reinterpretation of Husserl and Heidegger`s understanding of “givenness”, “the given” and the “gift” and his concept of Revelation as a saturated phenomenon, I want to critically illuminate his contribution to the concept of r/Revelation as a post-metaphysical and theological possibility."
10.22439/fs.v0i0.4933,Foucault’s Fossils: Life Itself and the Return to Nature in Feminist Philosophy,"This essay asks about the return to nature and “life itself” in contemporary feminist philosophy and theory, from the new materialisms to feminist science studies to environmental ethics and critical animal studies. Unlike traditional naturalisms, the contemporary turn to nature is explicitly posthumanist. Shifting their focus away from anti-essentialist critiques of woman-as-nature, these new feminist philosophies of nature have turned toward nonhuman animals, the cosmos, the climate, and life itself as objects of ethical concern. Drawing on Foucault, the essay probes the ethical meanings of the term “life itself” invoked in many of these renaturalizing projects. Focusing especially on the archival matter that guides Foucault’s thinking, I suggest that we rethink “life itself” not as a transhistorical substance but as the unstable materiality of history. I then reframe Foucault’s archival, genealogical perspective through the lens of the Anthropocene and geological time. Reconceiving our archive as a fossil record, I suggest that Foucault has much to contribute to environmental challenges to human exceptionalism and the anthropogenic destruction of other species and ourselves."
10.22439/fs.v0i19.4822,This Is What a Historicist and Relativist Feminist Philosophy of Disability Looks Like,"With this article, I advance a historicist and relativist feminist philosophy of disability. I argue that Foucault’s insights offer the most astute tools with which to engage in this intellectual enterprise. Genealogy, the technique of investigation that Friedrich Nietzsche famously introduced and that Foucault took up and adapted in his own work, demonstrates that Foucault’s historicist approach has greater explanatory power and transgressive potential for analyses of disability than his critics in disability studies have thus far recognized. I show how a feminist philosophy of disability that employs Foucault’s technique of genealogy avoids ahistorical, teleological, and transcultural assumptions that beleaguer much work in disability studies. The article also situates feminist philosophical work on disability squarely in age-old debates in (Eurocentric) Western philosophy about universalism vs. relativism, materialism vs. idealism, realism vs. nominalism, and freewill vs. determinism, as well as contributes to ongoing discussions in (Western) feminist philosophy and theory about (among other things) essentialism vs. constructivism, identity, race, sexuality, agency, and experience. "
10.1017/s0003055416000289,“Of Darkness from Vain Philosophy”: Hobbes's Critique of the Classical Tradition,"The early modern revolution in political philosophy not only transformed political philosophy itself; it also played a crucial role in shaping the character of modern politics. This article contributes to our understanding of that revolution through an examination of Thomas Hobbes's critique of the classical tradition. Although it is well known that Hobbes was a critic of that tradition, the details of his critique have not been sufficiently uncovered. Hobbes's key target was Aristotle, whom he regarded as the most important source of the tradition he opposed. Hobbes's critique of Aristotle consists of two main lines of argument—one moral-political, the other metaphysical—that ultimately prove to be connected. An examination of Hobbes's twofold critique can help us understand what was at stake in the reorientation of political philosophy that eventually gave rise to modern liberalism."

In contrast, emergentism claims that mental states are dependent on brain states, but have properties that go beyond the field of neurobiology.Conclusions: Only emergentism is compatible with a closer dialog between psychoanalysis and neuroscience."
10.2478/jped-2014-0007,Living in the senses and learning with love – John MacMurray’s philosophy of embodied emotion,"AbstractIn this article we analyse the central role that the body plays in John MacMurray’s account of learning to be human. As with Merleau-Ponty, MacMurray rejected mind-body dualisms and argued for the need to understand what it means to be a person. Through our analysis we highlight the key principles that characterize MacMurray’s philosophy in relation to personhood and the body, namely: 1) all human knowledge and action should be for the sake of friendship and 2) human persons exist first and foremost in their bodies as ‘knowing agents’ rather than in their minds as ‘knowing subjects’. We thereafter explain MacMurray’s views on education and how it must support people to live in personal rather than functional relation with each other by attending more to bodily experience and education of the emotions. Accordingly, MacMurray considered that persons can either ‘use’ their bodily senses as mere instruments for functional purposes or they can ‘live’ in their bodily senses by learning to love (not ‘using’ but rather apprehending the real value of) other persons. In conclusion, we suggest that MacMurray’s philosophy can open up a different way of thinking about the educational value of physical activity. For MacMurray shared physical pursuits are especially educational when carried out for their own sake and when all persons’ present experience moments of bodily joy and togetherness and a better understanding of each other."
10.1017/s0265052516000339,IN WHAT SENSE MUST POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY BE POLITICAL?,"Abstract:
            Political philosophy appears to have recovered from its alleged death in the
                    middle of the last century, but now faces the realist charge that in the work of
                    John Rawls and those influenced by him it fails to be political in the right
                    way; it is merely “applied moral philosophy.” I dismiss
                    the hyper-realist position of authors such as Raymond Geuss for taking an
                    implausibly narrow view of politics. There is more merit in Bernard
                    Williams’s claim that legitimacy, not justice, is the central problem
                    of political philosophy. Yet we cannot understand the significance of
                    legitimation without referring to the moral values that are realized when it
                    succeeds. Thus, Williams fails to show that political normativity can be
                    detached entirely from ethics. Moreover the legitimacy requirements of a liberal
                    state, according to Williams, are substantively close to the requirements of
                    justice according to Rawls. In light of the latter’s turn to
                    “political liberalism,” they appear also to hold
                    convergent views about the status of the theories they are advancing. I conclude
                    by suggesting that the “applied moral philosophy” charge
                    would apply only to philosophers who believe that general moral principles, like
                    utility or rights, can do all the work of political evaluation. Politics does
                    indeed have special features that impose distinctive justificatory requirements
                    on its procedures and the outcomes they produce."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190236953.001.0001,The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Race,"The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Race provides up-to-date explanation and analyses by leading scholars of contemporary issues in philosophy of race and African American philosophy. Ideas about race held by Locke, Hume, Kant, Hegel, and Nietzsche are supplemented by suppressed thought from the African diaspora, early twentieth-century African American perspectives, and Native American, Asian American, and Latin American views. Philosophical analysis is brought to bear on the status of racial divisions as human categories in the biological sciences, as well as within the architectonic of contemporary criticism and conceptual analysis. The special applications of American philosophy and continental philosophy to ideas of race are presented as methodological alternatives to more analytic approaches. As a collection of analyses and assessments of “race” in the real world, there is trenchant and relevant attention paid to historical and contemporary racism and what it means to say that “race” and racial identities are socially constructed. Analyses of contemporary social issues include the importance of racial difference and identity in education, public health, medicine, IQ and other standardized tests, and sports. Societal limitations and structures provided by public policy and law are realistically considered. As a critical theory, the study of race is compared to feminism. Historical and contemporary, as well as academic and popular, racisms pertaining to male and female gender receive special consideration. Although this comprehensive collection may have the effect of a textbook, each of the original essays is a fresh and authentic development of important present thought."
10.4102/satnt.v36i1.1388,The changing role of continuity and discontinuity in the history of philosophy and mathematics,"The aim of this article is to highlight the inevitability of employing discreteness and continuity as primitive (indefinable) modes of explanation in the history of philosophy and mathematics. It embodies the general challenge to account for the coherence of what is unique. Gödel emphasises the coherence of ‘primitive concepts’. Greek philosophy already discovered the spatial whole and/or parts relation with its infinite divisibility. During and after the medieval era philosophers toggled between an atomistic appreciation of the continuum and its opposite, for example found in the thought of Leibniz who postulated his law of continuity (lex continui). The discovery of incommensurability (irrational numbers) by the Greeks caused the first foundational crisis of mathematics, as well as its geometrisation. Leibniz and Newton did not resolve the problems surrounding the limit concept and soon it induced the third foundational crisis of mathematics. It caused Frege and the ‘continuum theoreticians’ to assign priority to the continuum – discreteness is a catastrophe. Recently Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis appreciated what is ‘continuous’ as constituting ‘an unbroken or uninterrupted whole’. Intuitionistic mathematics once more proceeded from an emphasis on the whole and/or parts relation. In spite of alternating attempts to understand continuity exclusively, either in arithmetical or in spatial terms, the history of philosophy and mathematics undeniably confirms that the co-conditioning role of these two modes of explanation remains a constant element in reflections on continuity and discontinuity. (The role of continuity and discontinuity within the disciplines of physics and biology will be discussed in a separate article.)"
10.1017/s0002731600081233,Some Issues in the Philosophy of Archaeology,"This paper identifies a domain of inquiry that lies at the interface between archaeology and the philosophy of science. I argue that in the recent past archaeology has contributed little to the philosophy of science. This situation can change if archaeologists succeed in calling those issues or controversies that have genuine philosophical import to the attention of philosophers. This paper provisionally explores two such areas: first, the use of ecological principles to explain human behavior; and second, problems of confirmation in ethnoarchaeology."

This Handbook encapsulates and furthers the influence of philosophy on probability, and of probability on philosophy. Nearly forty articles summarize the state of play and present new insights in various areas of research at the intersection of these two fields. The volume begins with a primer on those parts of probability theory that we believe are most important for philosophers to know, and the rest is divided into seven main sections: history; formalism; alternatives to standard probability theory; interpretations and interpretive issues; probabilistic judgment and its applications; applications of probability: science; and applications of probability: philosophy."

The paper claims that those transformations outline a research field more appropriately defined as historical knowledge studies, and focused on the conditions of possibility, operation, structure, institutional praxis, critical potential and political relevance of our knowledge about history. The study provides an outline of the emergence of new problems and topics in philosophy of history based on an analysis of the contents of a prominent journal crucial to the development of the field, &lt;em&gt;History and Theory&lt;/em&gt;, which has hosted many important debates on historical knowledge since the 1960s and whose editorial policy is recognised for its pluralism. This account of the transformation of the research field is supplemented by the findings of a study of the institutional localisation and geographic distribution of university courses in philosophy of history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;"
10.5194/gmd-2017-30,Practice and philosophy of climate model tuning across six U.S. modeling centers,"Model calibration (or ""tuning"") is a necessary part of developing and testing coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models regardless of their main scientific purpose. There is an increasing recognition that this process needs to become more transparent for both users of climate model output and other developers. Knowing how and why climate models are tuned and which targets are used is essential to avoiding possible misattributions of skillful predictions to data accommodation and vice versa. This paper describes the approach and practice of model tuning for the six major U.S. climate modeling centers. While details differ among groups in terms of scientific missions, tuning targets and tunable parameters, there is a core commonality of approaches. However, practices differ significantly on some key aspects, in particular, in the use of initialized forecast analyses as a tool, the explicit use of the historical transient record, and the use of the present day radiative imbalance vs. the implied balance in the pre-industrial as a target.

The widespread claim that the analytic philosophy of religion was from the beginning an Anglo-American affair is an ill-informed one. It is demonstrable that the enterprise, although not the label “analytic philosophy of religion,” appeared in Poland in the 1930’s. Józef Bocheński’s post-war work is a development of the Cracow Circle’s pre-war work in the analytic philosophy of religion, or at least of important elements of that earlier work. Bocheński’s approach in his Logic of Religion is quite original and might still be profitably studied and discussed by philosophers of religion of the analytic persuasion. "
10.22329/il.v26i2.440,The Philosophy of Error and Liberty of Thought: J.S. Mill on Logical Fallacies,"Most recent discussions of John Stuart Mill’s System of Logic (1843) neglect the fifth book concerned with logical fallacies. Mill not only follows the revival of interest in the traditional Aristotelian doctrine of fallacies in Richard Whately and Augustus De Morgan, but he also develops new categories and an original analysis which enhance the study of fallacies within the context of what he calls ‘the philosophy of error’. After an exploration of this approach, the essay relates the philosophy of error to the discussion of truth and error in chapter two of On Liberty (1859) concerned with freedom of thought and discussion. Drawing on Socratic and Baconian perspectives, Mill defends both the traditional study of logic against Jevons, Boole, De Morgan, and others, as well as the study of fallacies as the key to maintaining truth and its dissemination in numerous fields, such as science, morality, politics, and religion. In Mill’s view the study of fallacies also liberates ordinary people to explore the truth and falsity of ideas and, as such, to participate in society and politics and develop themselves as progressive beings."

I argue that there is a level of adversariality peculiar to philosophy that merits specific feminist examination, yet doesn’t assume controversial gender differences claims. The dominance of the argument-as-war metaphor is not warranted, since this metaphor misconstrues the epistemic role of good argument as a tool of rational persuasion. This metaphor is entangled with the persisting narrative of embattled reason, which, in turn, is linked to the sexism-informed narrative of the “man of reason” continually warding off or battling “feminine” unreason."
10.22329/p.v7i2.3814,Affective Resonance: On the Uses and Abuses of Music In and For Philosophy,"Because music communicates extra-propositionally, philosophers often use musical concepts and metaphors to discuss implicit and/or affective knowledges. Music is a productive means to philosophically analyze affect, but only when these analyses are grounded in rigorous studies of actual musical works and practices. When we don’t ground our study of music in musical practices, works, and theories, “music” just becomes a mirror of whatever assumptions and biases we already have. I show how the overly-abstract treatment of music and sound in Jean-Luc Nancy’s Listening leads to significant philosophical and political problems. By following his musical metaphors all the way through, I show how his theory of listening naturalizes maleness/masculinity, and, like liberal multiculturalism, values “difference” only as a way to re-center whiteness and patriarchy. As an alternative, I use R&amp;B/electropop singer Kelis’s 2010 single “Acapella” (sic) to develop an alternative account of music, affect, and the politics of difference."
10.15173/jhap.v5i4.2963,On Operator N and Wittgenstein’s Logical Philosophy,"In this paper, I provide a new reading of Wittgenstein’s N operator, and of its significance within his early logical philosophy. I thereby aim to resolve a longstanding scholarly controversy concerning the expressive completeness of N. Within the debate between Fogelin and Geach in particular, an apparent dilemma emerged to the effect that we must either concede Fogelin’s claim that N is expressively incomplete, or reject certain fundamental tenets within Wittgenstein’s logical philosophy. Despite their various points of disagreement, however, Fogelin and Geach nevertheless share several common and problematic assumptions regarding Wittgenstein’s logical philosophy, and it is these mistaken assumptions which are the source of the dilemma. Once we recognize and correct these, and other, associated expository errors, it will become clear how to reconcile the expressive completeness of Wittgenstein’s N operator, with several commonly recognized features of, and fundamental theses within, the Tractarian logical system."
10.1039/c7rp00054e,Does a course on the history and philosophy of chemistry have any effect on prospective chemistry teachers’ perceptions? The case of chemistry and the chemist,"The creative comparisons prospective chemistry teachers make about “chemistry” and the “chemist” may reflect how they perceive these concepts. In this sense, it seems important to determine which creative comparisons prospective teachers make with respect to these and how these can change after the history of chemistry is treated in the classroom. This study seeks to investigate the impact of the basic History and Philosophy of Chemistry course on prospective chemistry teachers’ perceptions towards chemistry and the chemist. The study was conducted during the 2012–2013 academic year at a state university in Turkey with 38 prospective chemistry teachers. A creative comparisons questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were used as data collection instruments in the study. This questionnaire was administered to the prospective teachers in the form of a pre-test, post-test, and retention test. Results of the analysis showed that the prospective teachers produced creative comparisons related to chemistry in the pre-test that mostly relied on their own experiences and observations, but that in the post-test and retention test, their comparisons mostly contained references to the role of chemistry in daily life, its development, and its facilitating aspects. Similarly, it was observed that in the pre-test, the prospective teachers made creative comparisons regarding the chemist that related mostly to the laboratory, but that the post-test and retention test rather contained the aspects of chemists as researchers, meticulous persons, facilitators and managers. Also, 18 prospective teachers were engaged in interviews to understand their prior knowledge about chemistry and the chemist, as well as the reasons for the changes in their creative comparisons. The results of the interviews indicated that a large majority of the prospective teachers were able to fully reflect on their inadequacy about their previous knowledge about “chemistry” and “chemist,” and it was seen that they could explain the reason they changed their creative comparisons as an outcome of the History and Philosophy of Chemistry course. In the light of these results, it can be said that the History and Philosophy of Chemistry course may help prospective chemistry teachers in their perceptions about both chemistry and the chemist and may add depth to their knowledge."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195146875.003.0003,Prehistory of Presocratic Philosophy in an Orientalizing Context,"Philosophy up to now is bound to a chain of tradition that starts with Greek texts about 2,400 years ago: the works of Plato and Aristotle have been studied continuously since then; they were transmitted to Persians and Arabs and back to Europe and are still found in every philosophical library. Plato, in turn, was not an absolute beginning; he read and criticized Heraclitus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Protagoras, and other sophists; Aristotle read and criticized Plato and everything else he could find, up to Anaximander. Even if philosophy is anything but certain about its own identity, the definition of philosophy is inseparably bound to the Greek fundaments. Nobody has been able to reinvent philosophy because it has always been there."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195146875.001.0001,The Oxford Handbook of Presocratic Philosophy,"The Oxford Handbook of Presocratic Philosophy brings together leading international scholars to study the diverse figures, movements, and approaches that constitute Presocratic philosophy. In the sixth and fifth centuries bc a new kind of thinker appeared in Greek city-states, dedicated to finding the origins of the world and everything in it, using observation and reason rather than tradition and myth. We call these thinkers Presocratic philosophers, and recognize them as the first philosophers of the Western tradition, as well as the originators of scientific thinking. New textual discoveries and new approaches make a reconsideration of the Presocratics at the beginning of the twenty-first century especially timely. More than a survey of scholarship, this study presents new interpretations and evaluations of the Presocratics' accomplishments, from Thales to the sophists, from theology to science, and from pre-philosophical background to their influence on later thinkers. Many positions presented here challenge accepted wisdom and offer alternative accounts of Presocratic theories. This book includes chapters on the Milesians (Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes), Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, the Pythagoreans, the atomists, and the sophists. Special studies are devoted to the sources of Presocratic philosophy, oriental influences, Hippocratic medicine, cosmology, explanation, epistemology, theology, and the reception of Presocratic thought in Aristotle and other ancient authors."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195146875.003.0017,"Reason, Cause, and Explanation in Presocratic Philosophy","In the Archaic Geek world of epic poetry, the causes of things are shrouded in divine mystery; the gods intervene in human affairs, and bring about events, in a cruel and capricious fashion, according to their whims; Apollo visits the devastating plague of Iliad 1 on the Greek host to avenge Agamemnon's ill-treatment of one of his priests; Poseidon shakes the earth and angers the sea, bringing to destruction those who have incurred his ire, as does Zeus himself with his thunderbolts. The gods take on human shape and intervene in battle with devastating effect. In tragedy, the houses of Atreus and of Laius are brought low when men offend against the gods. This article focuses on the explorations of the fundamental concepts of reasons and causation, and the problems of explanation, and argues that it is indeed reasonable to see in Presocratic thought the foundations of Western scientific explanation."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195146875.003.0020,Aristotle's Account of the Origins of Philosophy,"This article sheds light on Aristotle's own understanding of philosophy. It tries to give an account of how Aristotle seeks to determine and to explain the origin of philosophy and to account for its early development. It focuses on his account of the history of philosophy from its beginnings down to his own time in Metaphysics 1.3–10, in particular 1.3–6. It derives a good deal of knowledge about early Greek philosophy directly from Aristotle. A great deal of the information provided by later ancient sources itself is derived from Aristotle and his students, like Theophrastus or Eudemus. The evidential value of this information is rather high. It also is clear that Aristotle had his own particular perspective on the history of early Greek philosophy, and that his students largely shared his general view of the early history of Greek philosophy."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195146875.003.0002,The Sources for Presocratic Philosophy,"Between about 2,600 and 2,400 years ago, a group of men lived whose thought formed the beginning of the discipline of philosophy. All contemporary material records of these men have disappeared, with the possible exception of a piece of a statue and some likenesses on early coins and vases. The very notion that these philosophers can be best understood as Presocratics is redolent with interpretative interventions. Although this view is not without ancient precedents, the driving force behind its dominance in the twentieth century was the great achievement of the German classical scholar Hermann Diels (1848–1922), which exercises authority to this day. The aim of this article is to examine the sources for Presocratic philosophy. It commences with the dominant legacy of Diels. Thereafter, it examines various strands of transmission streamlined by Diels. Finally, it reaches some tentative conclusions on what should be the way forward in future research."
10.19030/jber.v11i2.7624,Differing Federal Individual Income Tax Perceptions: Political Party Affiliation And Ideological Philosophy,"Individuals who are affiliated with different political parties and who subscribe to different ideological philosophies also tend to have different views on many issues. This paper explores taxpayer perceptions of the federal individual income tax, which can be traced back to 1913 in its present form, based upon their political party affiliation as well as their ideological philosophy. The analysis revealed that the responses to the federal individual income tax statements included in this survey were not independent of political party or ideological philosophy. These results suggest that the political and ideological makeup of Congress and the President are likely to have an impact on future decisions with respect to possible modifications to the federal individual income tax. The question remains whether these differences may be set aside in a consolidated effort to find long range solutions to our countrys fiscal challenges."
10.19030/iber.v9i8.607,The Thai Financial Crisis And The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy,"This article revisits the financial crisis in 1997 using the sufficiency economy philosophy bestowed by His Majesty the King Bhumibol Adulyadej, shading some light on what went wrong, the lessons learnt, and possibly what can be done to prevent such crisis from happening again. The origin of the crisis was the fact that Thai economy grew too fast with the help of the financial liberalization in early 1990s. This rapid growth, however, violated the three elements of the sufficiency economy, which are moderation, reasonableness and self-immunity, in turns, exposed the country to trouble. On July 2, 1997, Thai land had to let the baht float freely, and that when the crisis started. More than ten years have passed, and we believe that we will not make the same mistakes again if we follow the sufficiency economy philosophy. The application of the philosophy is not limited only to the national level, but it is applicable to people from all walks of life at all levels. The philosophy can be boiled down to five axioms; (1) know what you are doing; (2) be honest and persevere; (3) take middle path; (4) be sensible and insightful in taking decisions; (5) build protection against shocks despite different applications, they all share the same goal of balanced and sustainable development."
10.19030/jier.v10i1.8465,Implementing Pragmatism And John Deweys Educational Philosophy In Jordanian Public Schools,"The teachings and writings of John Dewey, an American philosopher and educator, offer insightful influences on contemporary education, not only in the United States but also worldwide. His philosophy of education, commonly referred to as Pragmatism, focused on learning by doing as an alternative to rote knowledge and strict teaching. The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which this philosophical thought is implemented in Jordanian public schools according to Jordanian teachers. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed in this study. The findings reveal that Jordanian teachers believe Pragmatism is implemented in Jordan to a moderate degree."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0007,Classical Political Philosophy: Plato and Aristotle,"Systematic political thought in ancient Greece begins with Plato, and quickly reaches its zenith in the rich and complex discussions in Aristotle's Politics. The political theories of both philosophers are closely tied to their ethical theories, and their interest is in questions concerning constitutions or forms of government. Herodotus sketches a fascinating debate by proponents of three forms of government: democracy, monarchy, and oligarchy. In Euripides' Suppliant Maidens, there is a debate between Theseus, champion of Athenian democracy, and a messenger from Creon, ruler of Thebes. Among Plato's predecessors there was a tradition of political thought and debate, but he was the first Greek thinker to undertake a careful, systematic analysis of fundamental questions in political philosophy. This article discusses Socrates' influence on Plato. It then looks at Plato's masterpiece, the Republic, and considers his model of an ideal constitution. It concludes with a discussion of Aristotle's complex and sophisticated analysis of political constitutions."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0009,Early Christian Political Philosophy,"Early Christian political philosophy is not a unified, theoretical, and coherent system, but is embedded in a range of Christian works of apology, theology, and exegesis. Literate (and therefore elite) Christians from the apologists to Augustine were subject to a range of political and social pressures, and their political thinking was often contingent and incidental. What is the ultimate goal of political life for Christians? What is the good life for Christians? Between Constantine's reign and that of Theodosius at the close of the fourth century, emperors veered from the pious to the “heretical,” with a single pagan interruption. It was a common rhetorical conceit for Christians to redefine philosophy as Christianity, and one that became more urgent during Julian's reign. He attempted to wrest Greek philosophy and culture from the Christians for his revived paganism, dubbed “Hellenism,” and even barred Christians from teaching in his school edict of 362. This article focuses on early Christian political philosophy as well as ecclesiology, eschatology, and asceticism."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0013,Renaissance Political Philosophy,"Since the idea of Rome and a united Christendom was the horizon within which Renaissance political thought developed, the alternatives to papal and imperial tutelage consisted in subverting the Roman-papal paradigm from within (Niccolò Machiavelli's solution) or rejecting Rome altogether (the road taken by French légistes such as Francis Hotman and Jean Bodin). This article focuses on the two most prominent, and arguably also most influential, political thinkers of the Renaissance period, Niccolò Machiavelli (1469–1527) and Thomas More (1478–1535). Although it is highly unlikely that either author knew of the existence of the other, let alone was familiar with his work, the fact that Machiavelli's Prince (1513) and Discourses on Livy (1514–1518) and More's Utopia (1516) were written only a few years apart invites comparison. While focusing on Machiavelli and More, we must not forget that there were many other Renaissance writers, humanists, philosophers, and others, who commented on politics and contributed to the overall development of political thought and political philosophy in the period."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0004,The Value of the History of Political Philosophy,"To ask, “What is the worth or value of the history of political philosophy?” is a rather complicated question with many competing answers. The answer(s) one gives depends to a very large degree on the approach one takes or the “school” of interpretation to which one belongs. Some answer that there are “perennial questions” and “timeless truths” to be found in classic works of political philosophy that speak to us still. Others answer that such study reveals the roots or origins of present-day political movements such as communism and fascism. This article considers the possibility that the history of political philosophy and its scholarly study are without value. After dispatching this rather philistine view, it shows how various approaches to interpretation assign very different value to the study of the history of political philosophy. These approaches include the “perennial problems,” Marxism, “ideological origins,” feminism, Straussian approach, postmodernism, and the Cambridge School."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0005,History of Political Philosophy as a Discipline,"Whether one speaks of the study of the history of political philosophy, the history of political theory, or the history of political thought, the reference is typically to one basic scholarly genre. Although this body of scholarship is now the province of a distinctly interdisciplinary academic practice, bridging, and including, fields such as philosophy, history, and literary criticism, it is professionally largely the product of a subdiscipline located primarily in departments of political science, politics, or government. In the United States, the emerging social sciences, during the nineteenth century, were primarily the confluence of three closely related tributaries: elements of academic moral philosophy, often inspired by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers; individuals such as William Graham Sumner, who taught a scientific understanding of society and elicit the secret of social progress; and movements such as those represented in the American Social Science Association, which invoked the cognitive authority of science as they pursued a variety of causes from abolition to civil service reform."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0006,The Origins of Political Philosophy,"“Political philosophy” betrays by its name that its origins lie in Greece. Both words, “political,” and “philosophy,” derive from ancient Greek. “Philosophy” comes from philia (“love”) and sophia (“wisdom”) which, taken together, indicate the love of wisdom. “Political” derives from the adjective politikos, which means “belonging or pertaining to the polis.” Typically translated as city or city state, a polis was distinguished from other types of community by the presence of distinct activities, among them commercial exchange, judicial proceedings, and public deliberation. The Greek urban settlements that came to be called poleis date to some time around 1000 bce; they were generally built around an agora or marketplace. We might identify the origins of political philosophy as lying in the conversion of traditions of wisdom literature, under the pressure of the needs of democracy, into analytical accounts of politics that relied increasingly on an abstract and systematic conceptual vocabulary. This article looks at how Greek political thinkers such as Herodotus, Solon, Thucydides, Gorgias, and Lysias contributed to the birth of political philosophy."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0018,Enlightenment Political Philosophy,"Toleration, secularization, and an associated critique of confessional religion might have served previous generations as organizing themes for an account of political philosophy during the Enlightenment. Two prominent attempts have been made in recent years to bring clarity to the political philosophies of the enlightenment era. The first is Jonathan Israel's assertion of a radical enlightenment critical of state and clerical authority, and of social hierarchies, which he traces from rebellions such as the Fronde in France (1648–1653), the Masaniello revolt in Naples (1647), and the civil wars in England, Scotland, and Ireland between 1638 and 1660, up to their culmination in the French Revolution (1789–1799). A sense of the contrasting scholarly perception of enlightenment political philosophy is evident by comparing Israel's views with those of John Robertson's The Case for the Enlightenment: Scotland and Naples 1680–1760 (2005). This article explores Enlightenment political philosophy and discusses the absolute monarchy of France, political philosophy in Britain and in Europe's small states, and philosophies of despotism."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0025,Political Philosophy and the Idea of a Social Science,"It appears that the first recognizably modern understanding of the term “social science” was developed during the French Revolution. From its origins, the search for a science of politics modelled upon the perceived success of the natural sciences has been shaped at least as much by political objectives as by pure intellectual curiosity. From their first appearance, the concepts of a social science or of moral or political science were used interchangeably. There can be no doubt that the emergence of the social sciences has had a transformative effect upon the language and style of modern political philosophy. From its origins in ancient Greece, political philosophy has sought the foundations of political order. The major and most influential philosophy of science was, and to a large extent still is, positivism in its various formulations. The origins of this philosophy are associated primarily with Auguste Comte and, in England with some qualification, John Stuart Mill."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0026,Contemporary Anglo-American Political Philosophy,"According to a now familiar narrative, in the middle of the twentieth century, political philosophy was “dead,” but it has since been resurrected in a new form. Credit for the death certificate is given to Peter Laslett, who bemoaned the absence of major philosophers writing in English, like the tradition of thinkers from Thomas Hobbes to Bernard Bosanquet. According to many theorists, responsibility for the revival of political philosophy belongs to John Rawls. One of Rawls's most important contributions is the method of “reflective equilibrium.” In A Theory of Justice (1971), Rawls attempts to reconcile freedom and equality in a principled way, offering an account of “justice as fairness.” Three years after publication of Theory, Rawls's Harvard colleague Robert Nozick published Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974), which is, after Theory, probably the most celebrated and widely discussed work in political philosophy in recent decades. This article explores contemporary Anglo-American political philosophy, the evolution of Rawls's thought, communitarianism, feminism and liberalism, multiculturalism, and global justice."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0028,Political Philosophy in a Globalizing World,"Political philosophy in a globalizing world is not confined to thinking about globalization. “Globalization” is identified with economic trends such as the internationalization of commerce and finance, cultural trends such as the spread of English, and political trends such as the erosion of state sovereignty and the emergence of transnational policy networks. If globalization means increasing interdependence—moral, economic, and ecological—it invites reflection on how this interdependence is affecting the study of political philosophy. Subsequent debates over the role of great powers, the threat or advantages of empire, the role of the United Nations, and the lessons of the European Union have continued the line of inquiry begun by Immanuel Kant. With globalization, however, debate has moved away from confederation to focus on the idea of constitutionalism without the state. Contra Karl Marx, the point of philosophy is to understand the world, not to change it. Political philosophy in this sense is only one part of “political thought,” most of which in any society is politics itself under another name."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0048,Confucian Political Philosophy,"Confucianism is an ethics tied intimately with political philosophy. According to the text that is the most reliable guide to the teachings of Confucius, the Analects (Lunyu), he took the Mandate of Heaven (tianming) as a guide. The Mandate was formulated during the early period of the Zhou dynasty to justify the overthrow of the Shang dynasty and to legitimate the rule of the Zhou kings. The Confucian diagnosis of China's troubles suggests that the way out of the turmoil required a moral transformation led by the top ranks of Chinese society, a return to the virtue of the early Zhou kings. This article discusses Confucianism and its relation to political philosophy, the role of ritual in the cultivation of goodness, the concepts of ren and junzi, filial piety, the debate between Mozi and Mencius over filial loyalty versus impartial concern, family as the paradigm in a relational and communal conception of political society, the goodness or badness of human nature and its relation to morality, perfectionism and harmony, democracy, rights, and gender equality."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0050,Hindu Political Philosophy,"The long tradition of Hindu philosophy in India had several distinct peaks of systematic thought. The apogee of its political theory developed during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as a response to the British imperial authority, commonly known as the Raj. This article describes modern Hindu political philosophy's admixture of its classical tradition with contemporary Indian nationalism as it encountered British theories of freedom, equality, power, and social or political change. The result was an original and cogent system of ideas that at once responded to the British intellectual challenge and reconstituted key elements of the classical Indian philosophical tradition. The leading formulators of this formidable project were four major Hindu theorists: Swami Vivekananda, Aurobindo Ghose, Rabindranath Tagore, and Mohandas K. Gandhi. These four are intricately connected by a logical nexus of concepts derived from their common religion, their interpretative intellectual project of reforming Hinduism in the face of British colonialism, and their significant commitment to the cause of Indian independence."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238804.003.0049,The Muslim Tradition of Political Philosophy,"The doctrine of salvation in Islam centers on the community of believers. Contemporary Muslim political philosophy (or, preferably, political theory) covers a broad expanse that brings under its rubric at least two diverse tendencies: an approach that stresses the integration of religion and politics, and an approach that insists on their separation. Advocates of the first approach seem united in their desire for the “Islamization of knowledge,” meaning that the epistemological foundation of understanding and explanation in all areas of life, including all areas of political life, must be “Islamic.” Thus, one needs to speak of an “Islamic anthropology,” an “Islamic sociology,” an “Islamic political science,” and so on. But there is also a distinction that one may make among advocates of this first approach. Moreover, one can say about many, perhaps most, advocates of the first approach that they feel an urgency to apply Islamic law throughout all arenas of society. This article focuses on the Muslim tradition of political philosophy and considers the following themes: the individual and society, the state, and democracy."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199664153.013.021,Contributions from Philosophy,"Gender, like race, is a controversial and volatile topic. We encounter one another as embodied and thus gendered beings. But what precisely is gender? What does it mean to be feminine? This chapter offers a philosophical analysis of the concept of gender and discourses about gender. The opening sections begin with a discussion of key terms and distinctions such as gender essentialism, gender as a social construction, the distinction between gender and (biological) sex, gender realism and nominalism, and so forth. Specific examples—both historical and contemporary—are employed to elucidate the claim that gender is socially constructed. Two sections are devoted to prominent feminist philosophers, Judith Butler and Linda Martín Alcoff. The topics addressed in these sections include: Butler’s notion of performing gender and her rejection of the gender/sex distinction, and Alcoff’s development of gender as positionality and fluid identity and her historically and materially sensitive version of gender realism."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.9,The Methodology of Legal Philosophy,"This article examines methodological debates in legal philosophy by focusing on two (related) methodological claims in H. L. A. Hart’s 1961 book, The Concept of Law: that Hart’s theory is both general and descriptive, and an exercise in both linguistic analysis and descriptive sociology. It considers what these claims reveal about Hart’s theoretical ambitions and methodological commitments, and what light they shed on debates in legal philosophy since then. In particular, it discusses the most important elements of Hart’s theory, such as the union of primary and secondary rules in law, the “rule of recognition” as a social rule, and the relationship between legal and moral norms. It also explores several objections to Hart’s approach to the problems of legal philosophy, including one that questions the fruitfulness of the methodology of conceptual analysis. Finally, it analyzes the argument of Hart and all legal positivists that legal systems are social constructs."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.33,Methods in the Philosophy of Literature and Film,"This article discusses methods in the philosophy of literature and film (PLF). It begins by providing some background on PLF and how it differs from those philosophically influenced projects for understanding and interpreting literature and film most often undertaken by film and literary scholars. It then reviews the history of the study of literature and film before considering how particular filmic or literary works might function as evidence for, or as things to be explained by, general claims offered within PLF. It examines the claim that literary and filmic works may themselves be sources of philosophical ideas and, sometimes, contributions to philosophy itself. It then describes Darwinian approaches to PLF. Finally, it considers the role of empirical evidence in assessing claims about the value of literature as a source of knowledge."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.15,Critical Philosophy of Race,"This article tries to provide a genealogy for, and a characterization of, “critical philosophy of race,” which has only recently begun to gain formal recognition as a subject within the discipline. After discussing the contested periodization of race and racism, the author turns to the related question of whether they have affected the history of Western philosophy from the classical epoch to modernity. Then he reviews contemporary scholarship in critical philosophy of race, looking at standard divisions of the field: metaphysics (the metaphysics of race); epistemology (social epistemology, standpoint theory, and “whiteness”); aesthetics (race and structures of feeling, racism and anti-racism in works of art); ethics (the moral challenges of slavery, white supremacy, and their ongoing legacy); social and political philosophy (competing analyses of racism as a concept, competing etiologies of racism as a reality, racial domination and racial justice); and existentialism, phenomenology, and pragmatism (the lived experience of race)."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.14,Experimental Philosophy,"Experimental philosophy is an extension of the Naturalists’ Challenge to the use of intuitions in philosophy. This chapter explores this challenge and traditional or “armchair” responses to it, focusing especially on the case of reference. It first considers the role and nature of intuitions, along with two kinds of experimental philosophical challenges to their use: the challenge from irrelevant determination and the challenge from diversity. It then explores using the challenge from diversity to undermine the reliability of intuitions as evidence for the truth of philosophical claims, and examines critical responses to the challenge from diversity. The chapter concludes by evaluating the possibility that diversity in responses to thought experiments occur even within individuals, and the implications of this for the Naturalists’ Challenge."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.6,Disagreement in Philosophy,"This article explores the epistemological significance of disagreement in philosophy in the light of some currently prominent theories of disagreement. More specifically, it asks whether the kind of pervasive and intractable disagreement that is characteristic of philosophy warrants a certain kind of skepticism about the subject. Some hold that, given the kind of disagreement found in philosophy, it would be irrational to hold confident views about controversial philosophical questions. According to this line of thought, the rational response to the diversity of opinion within philosophy is that of the philosophical agnostic, who consistently suspends judgment about controversial issues. Against this, it is argued that there is no plausible view about the epistemology of disagreement on which philosophical agnosticism is compelling."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.28,Ordinary Language Philosophy,"The article presents, clarifies, defends, and shows the contemporary relevance of ordinary language philosophy (OLP), as a general approach to the understanding and dissolution of at least very many traditional and contemporary philosophical difficulties. The first section broadly characterizes OLP, points out its anticipation in Immanuel Kant’s dissolution of metaphysical impasses in the ‘Transcendental Dialectic’ of the Critique of Pure Reason, and then shows its contemporary relevance by bringing its perspective to bear on the recent debates concerning the philosophical ‘method of cases’. The second section responds to a series of common objections to, and misunderstandings of, OLP."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.36,Philosophy and Psychology,"Philosophy and psychology have always been inseparable, particularly with regard to issues of  methodology.  The chapter begins with a brief history of the a priori and introspectivist traditions of both, and of the various forms of behaviorism that were a reaction to them.  It then turns to the “computational” and “functionalist” approaches to the mind that grew out of the development of the computer and especially the linguistic work of Noam Chomsky.  These blossomed into the research program of “cognitive science” that combines work in linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, biology, and computer science to empirically address questions about the nature and architecture of the mind, and issues in semantics, epistemology, and moral psychology.  the chapter concludes by briefly discussing two important cases concerning the nature of consciousness, its supposed “unity,” and various forms of self-blindness, which raise surprising empirical questions about our introspective access to our mental states."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.22,Philosophy of Mathematics,"This article examines a number of issues and problems that motivate at least much of the literature in the philosophy of mathematics. It first considers how the philosophy of mathematics is related to metaphysics, epistemology, and semantics. In particular, it reviews several views that account for the metaphysical nature of mathematical objects and how they compare to other sorts of objects, including realism in ontology and nominalism. It then discusses a common claim, attributed to Georg Kreisel that the important issues in the philosophy of mathematics do not concern the nature of mathematical objects, but rather the objectivity of mathematical discourse. It also explores irrealism in truth-value, the dilemma posed by Paul Benacerraf, epistemological issues in ontological realism, ontological irrealism, and the connection between naturalism and mathematics."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.17,The Methodology of the History of Philosophy,"What are the methodological consequences of the fact that Philosophy has a history and that Philosophy incorporates the products of the history of Philosophy into its current practice? Is an internal ‘philosophical’ history of Philosophy possible and desirable or is the history of Philosophy best approached as a branch of Intellectual History and/or Cultural History. This chapter first sketches some of the history of the study of philosophy’s past and contrasts some widely employed ‘doxological’, ‘anthropological’, and sociological approaches to that study with the approaches employed in a particular, historically recent discipline, History of Philosophy. It argues that History of Philosophy has a distinctive methodological structure which poises it interestingly between the disciplines of History and Philosophy and which can be usefully compared with, but is quite distinct from, that of the History of Science."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.1,Nineteenth-Century and Early Twentieth-Century Post-Kantian Philosophy,"This article examines three moments of the post-Kantian philosophical tradition in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: Kantianism, Post-Kantian Idealism, and Neo-Kantianism. It elucidates the distinctive methods of a tradition that has never entirely disappeared and is now acknowledged once again as the source of contemporary insights. It outlines two problematics—naturalist scepticism and historicist nihilism—threatening the possibility of metaphysics. The first concerns sceptical worries about reason, emerging from attempts to extend the methods of natural science to the study of human beings. Kant’s project of a critical and transcendental analysis of reason, with its distinctive methods, should be considered a response. The second arises from the development of new methods of historical inquiry, seeming to undermine the very possibility of individual agency. Also considered are Kant’s successors’ revisions of the critical and transcendental analysis of reason, undertaken to overcome challenges confronting the original versions of Kant’s methods."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.23,Methodology in Nineteenth-and Early Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy,"Early analytic philosophical methodology was dominated by two paradigms. The first, arising from the logicism of Frege and Russell, held that linguistic and logical analyses are tools for answering traditional philosophical questions—for example, What are numbers, material objects, and other minds? and How do we know about them? The answers were that these things are whatever they have to be to explain our knowledge of them. For Russell, this inspired a conception of logical analysis that led to revisionary metaphysical minimalism in the service of an unexamined conception of knowledge. The second paradigm, stemming from Wittgenstein and Carnap, was based on philosophical theories of the limits of meaningful discourse that excluded most traditional philosophy. G. E. Moore, whose starting point was common-sense knowledge, offered a partial corrective to both paradigms. The era’s most important achievements were the foundations it laid for genuine sciences of language, logic, and information."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.013.11,Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art,"This article focuses on aesthetics and the philosophy of art as branches of so-called analytic philosophy. It begins with a historical overview of aesthetics and the philosophy of art before turning to a discussion of how the philosophy of art bears upon human culture. It then considers the methods used in attacking problems in aesthetics and the philosophy of art by highlighting the distinctions between pure and applied philosophy, between internal and external perspectives on aesthetic and artistic phenomena, and between first-order and second-order methods. It also examines how aesthetics and the philosophy of art are affected as the arts evolve and as empirical studies of aesthetic and artistic phenomena become well established in the social and behavioural sciences as well as the humanities."

Alternately, the term is sometimes used to refer to agricultural practices that avoid depleting resources or which can be expected to leave future generations as well off as the present generation or which will avoid diminishing future opportunities or the ability of later generations to satisfy their needs. This chapter considers several alternative conceptions of “sustainability” and different ways to understand and articulate the concept of “sustainable agriculture.” Then it considers several specific agricultural practices, evaluating what it would mean for them to be sustainable."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199372263.013.38,"Farming, the Virtues, and Agrarian Philosophy","Food production can be viewed as one among many activities that produce goods in modern industrial societies, with ethical issues analogous to those of other sectors of the economy. Contrarily, agriculture and farming have historically been thought to have unique influence on the nature of social institutions, the reinforcement of moral virtues, and the reproduction of cultural forms. Mainstream approaches in consequentialist and deontological ethics implicitly adopt the first perspective: the industrial philosophy of agriculture. The chapter summarizes alternative agrarian viewpoints, emphasizing the role of the household farm in the thought of Aristotle and Xenophon, as well as the special role accorded to agriculture in early modern debates on property and political economy. It concludes with the emergence of contemporary agrarian philosophies that see farming and food systems as uniquely significant for environmental ethics and sustainability."

Dalam karyanya berjudul Aenesidemus, Gottlob Ernst Schulze mempertanyakan klaim Kant bahwa skeptisisme Hume telah terjawab melalui filsafat kritisnya. Artikel ini pertama-tama membahas teks Aenesidemus dengan memberikan perhatian khusus pada kritik Schulze terhadap pandangan Karl Leonhard Reinhold mengenai ‘fakultas’ representasi dan kegagalan Kant dalam membedakan antara sebab dan syarat pengetahuan. Dalam tanggapannya terhadap karya Schulze ini, Fichte memperlihatkan kesalahpahaman Schulze atas pokok-pokok penting dalam filsafat kritis sekaligus menunjukkan arah filsafat kritis yang hendak ditempuhnya sendiri. Di satu sisi, filsafat kritis memang menuai polemik dengan berbagai kritik dan tanggapan yang mengubah arah filsafat Barat sendiri. Akan tetapi, di sisi lain, seluruh rangkaian peristiwa ini justru memperlihatkan sebuah dialog dalam filsafat sendiri sebagai usaha untuk menemukan fondasi kuat dan mantap atas klaim-klaimnya. Dialog ini menunjukkan keterbukaan filsafat terhadap berbagai bentuk kebenaran yang terus menerus disingkapkan.&#x0D;

10.1515/ang-2018-0007,Notes toward The Philosophy of Theatre,"AbstractThis article draws from the contemporary French thinker François Laruelle to perform a ‘non-philosophical’ analysis of recent literature from the analytic or Anglo-American philosophy of theatre. Much of this literature, I argue, suffers from the problem of application, namely: non- or extra-theatrical assumptions are both brought to bear upon and remain unchallenged by the philosopher’s encounter with theatre – particularly in the form of assumptions as to the nature of philosophy or the role or position of philosophy with respect to other forms of thought, such as theatre and performance. Having sought to articulate some of the problems arising from the conception of the philosophy of theatre as a definitional project, the article then considers – via Laruelle – what kind of ‘stance’ a philosophy of theatre might need to occupy in order not to impose its thought on theatre but to be open to theatre’s thoughts."
10.24973/2017.158.00001,A philosophy for Opening Biotechnology Collaboration for Therapeutics,"The pharmaceutical industry faces a host of worsening problems:  Multibillion-dollar expenses and decade-long development times to bring new drugs to market, high failure rates for new drug candidates, and a patent system that is both expensive and uncertain.  Demanding regulatory requirements and governmental pressures on prescription costs add yet more pressure on drug development.  Although the situation does not yet constitute a crisis, its current trajectory is becoming increasingly untenable.   While the industry itself has been resourceful in introducing technological advances and operating reforms such as increased collaboration through patent pooling,  these efforts do not exhaust the possibilities for improvement.  In particular, there has been an emerging, more agile and responsive alternative model in pharmaceutical research and development, namely open source synthetic biology – a rapidly developing and highly collaborative effort based on engineering principles involving the design and construction of biological systems using standardized modules of DNA.  Synthetic biology began entirely open to those who wished to participate, provided that they agreed to share their results without restrictions.  In its current and more mature state, it retains much of its open source character and is consequently less dependent on secrecy and patent protection than the pharmaceutical industry’s largely proprietary approach.
The success of open source synthetic biology has inspired us to further develop that approach for research and development in Biotechnology and its pharmaceutical applications.  Here, we reviewed the history and progress of open source science and technology."
10.12957/childphilo.2018.29859,putting philosophy to the service of schools to give children’s voices real value,"This article explores a modern approach to childhood that abandons the traditional view of children in western societies as inferior, fragile and vulnerable. The modern approach explored in this paper takes a plural perspective in the conception of children as people who are able to think for themselves and who have the absolute right to participate in the affairs that affect them. This modern approach is related in this study to the free-rangers thesis, in which childhood is interpreted as a process of maturation and not as a stage of life, which is the conception linked to the traditional percepcion of childhood in the western societies. In the framework of formal education, this modern approach to childhood is related to Freire’s liberating education and the proposals for the school of philosophy with children in which philosophical practices are encouraged from an early age, thereby stimulating a much more active role for children in schools and giving their voice due recognition. So, this study highlights the importance of promoting liberating education in schools with the aim of making every effort to subvert the traditional roles of both teachers and pupils in formal education to give a more active role to children. In thi sense, this paper calls for the activity of philosophy whith children and encourages the idea of putting philosophy at the service of schools to give children’s voices greater value."
10.1017/s0017816015000139,Georges Florovsky's Monograph “Herzen's Philosophy of History”: The New Archival Material and the Reconstruction of the Full Text,"Georges Florovsky (1893–1979) was a prominent Russian émigré historian, philosopher, Orthodox theologian, and ecumenist. He was also the first Orthodox theologian to teach at Harvard Divinity School (1957–1964). In the 1920s, Florovsky wrote and defended his dissertation on the leading nineteenth-century Russian public intellectual, Alexander Herzen (1812–1870). Until now, the full text of Florovsky's work had been considered lost. I recently found five documents containing a substantial portion of the dissertation in the Georges Florovsky Papers archive of the St Vladimir's Seminary Library (GFP SVS). This newly discovered material amounts to about one-half of the dissertation and contains some important clues for reconstructing the remaining half of the work. My article discusses: 1) the plan of the dissertation and the history of its composition; 2) Florovsky's defense of the dissertation in Prague in 1923, as summarized in Alexander Izgoev's report, preserved in the Georges Florovsky Papers at the Princeton University Library (GFP PUL); 3) Florovsky's preparation of the dissertation for publication; 4) the description of the newly discovered archival material; and 5) the reconstruction of the dissertation, as preserved in the redactions of 1928–1930. The dissertation is the only monographic study that Florovsky ever finished, his other book-length studies being surveys rather than monographs. The dissertation is also important for understanding the methodological presuppositions of Florovsky's magnum opus,The Ways of Russian Theology(1937)."
10.20396/etd.v20i1.8647043,The written production of argumentative and dissertation text: a didactic project based on Bakhtin's philosophy,"This article is characterized as a theoretical and practical research related to a project developed during the year 2015 in two schools - one public, the other private- , in the city of Birigui, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The main goal of the study was to analyze: the pedagogical project and the teachers’ activities oriented towards teaching and learning of argumentative and dissertation texts. The methodology used in this research comprised: (i) visiting both schools, (ii) producing a description of ongoing school practices, with focus on the teaching of argumentative and dissertation texts, (iii) suggesting a teacher’s activity to improve this apprenticeship, (iv) putting this activity into practice and (v) analyzing obtained results. The theoretical framework used for this study was the Bakhtinian philosophy (BAKHTIN, 2013; 2006a; 2006b; 2006c; 2006d; 2010; 2013; VOLOSHINOV, 1986). This theoretical approach was chosen due to the importance of comprehension of the text not just as an amalgamated set of words, phrases and paragraphs; other than that, we understand it as a structure of meaning, in which we encounter linguistic forms, ideologies and discursive stance. At last, we can say the results show that the argumentative texts render assistance to the development of the students’ argumentative competence and skill, that is, in their ability to argue and organize ideas in a communicative situation."
10.1017/s0018246x17000310,"FREDERICK THE GREAT AND JEAN LE ROND D'ALEMBERT ON PHILOSOPHY, TRUTH, AND POLITICS","AbstractThe prize question of the Berlin Academy of Sciences for 1780, on the utility of deception, has attracted both controversy and scholarly interest. Yet very little attention has been dedicated to the question's peculiar beginnings in the correspondence between the philosopher and mathematician Jean Le Rond d'Alembert and Frederick the Great, king of Prussia, in a discussion concerning the expulsion of the Jesuits from France. This correspondence not only reveals the prize question's complex genealogy in long-standing debates on the true ends of philosophy, but also helps revise conventional frameworks for understanding the relationship between philosophy and politics in Enlightenment Europe. Far from an adornment intended to boost the ‘Enlightened’ credentials of an absolutist king, d'Alembert held the momentum in this relationship, and recruited Frederick to his own campaign of promoting publicly useful philosophy. ‘Philosophy’ here amounted to a commitment to the truth and its public defence, rather than subscription to or belief in a specific set of ideas or political reforms. Placing pressure on rulers to disavow deceitful politics, the far-reaching implications of this conception of philosophy for political life were no less ambitious than the agendas espoused by protagonists of a supposed ‘radical Enlightenment’."

10.30752/nj.69567,What is Jewish in Jewish philosophy?,"The aim of this article is to explore understandings of Jewish philosophy. According to Daniel H. Frank, Jewish philosophy is an academic discipline invented in the nineteenth century by scholars intent on gaining a foothold of academic respectability. Once the category Jewish philosophy was created by the German Wissenschaft des Judentums it was associated with general philosophy in order to include certain thinkers and exclude others. The author defines two criteria on what can be defined as Jewish philosophy. The author claims that Jewish in Jewish philosophy is in some reasonable way, 1) the identity of the philosopher and 2) the theme or the subject of his or her philosophy. We can speak of Jewish philosophy without thinking about it as a subdivision of general philosophy. It is then what Jewish philosophers do when they make Jewish tradition or Jewish questions their subject matter."
10.18535/ijsshi/v5i5.03,Legalisasi Islamic Law with analytic philosophy approach Model of language analysis,"Legalization of Shari'a is related to the establishment of a religious society. Shari'a is derived because there are causes that expect it to be derived and its application is dependent on the existence of the continuous changes on the society's reality and the events that are always new event.

Law makers are not limited to the text set by the Qur'an, but they include the results of ijtihad with qiyas and so on. On this basis, scholars need the reorientation of the theory of law limitation: There is a law that is set by the Qur'an which is limited to a specific time only, and there is a law that is set by the Qur'an which is applied generally based on the existing context."

As a multidicipliner science, counseling more flexible than any other dicipline. But in this 21 century counseling as a profession that has been challenges by something that must admit and counselor must know about this, such counseling multicultural, indigineous science that become an interesting subject, counseling has a value contract or not?, and counseling to educate and make client learn something or something that client found by them self?

10.1155/2015/704587,From Determinism and Probability to Chaos: Chaotic Evolution towards Philosophy and Methodology of Chaotic Optimization,"We present and discuss philosophy and methodology of chaotic evolution that is theoretically supported by chaos theory. We introduce four chaotic systems, that is, logistic map, tent map, Gaussian map, and Hénon map, in a well-designed chaotic evolution algorithm framework to implement several chaotic evolution (CE) algorithms. By comparing our previous proposed CE algorithm with logistic map and two canonical differential evolution (DE) algorithms, we analyse and discuss optimization performance of CE algorithm. An investigation on the relationship between optimization capability of CE algorithm and distribution characteristic of chaotic system is conducted and analysed. From evaluation result, we find that distribution of chaotic system is an essential factor to influence optimization performance of CE algorithm. We propose a new interactive EC (IEC) algorithm, interactive chaotic evolution (ICE) that replaces fitness function with a real human in CE algorithm framework. There is a paired comparison-based mechanism behind CE search scheme in nature. A simulation experimental evaluation is conducted with a pseudo-IEC user to evaluate our proposed ICE algorithm. The evaluation result indicates that ICE algorithm can obtain a significant better performance than or the same performance as interactive DE. Some open topics on CE, ICE, fusion of these optimization techniques, algorithmic notation, and others are presented and discussed."

10.1093/oso/9780190687328.003.0005,The College for Instruction in Elementary Philosophy,"Ebenezer Sibly returned to London in 1787–90. He followed many enthusiasms, trying to make his interests turn a quick profit. “Quick” seems to have been the operative term—he displays very little patience, flitting from one money-making scheme to the next. None were very successful. In 1788, Sibly joined John Bell, a mesmerist, and Stephen Freeman, a quack doctor, in a failed attempt to set up a school for esotericism. Sibly continued to work on the “numbers” of his work on astrology, perfecting his technique as a plagiarist. He used this skill to publish yet another revival of Nicholas Culpeper’s popular The English Physician. Thus, by 1789 it becomes apparent that Sibly had changed direction: no longer an astrologer per se, he took a series of very deliberate steps to become a quack doctor."
10.1093/oso/9780198783909.003.0002,Common Sense and Ideal Theory in Seventeenth-Century Scottish Philosophy,"In the nineteenth century James McCosh and many others identified the Common Sense school with “Scottish philosophy” tout court: the supposedly collective “Scottish” reply to Hume was the rejection of skepticism and Ideal Theory. This chapter addresses the anticipations of the Common Sense school and its broader place in the history of Scottish philosophy. The seventeenth-century Scottish philosophers reacted to Cartesian skepticism with epistemological views which anticipate Thomas Reid: direct realism and perception as a faculty of judgment. Common sense-like views seem to have been a popular strategy against skepticism already before the Common Sense school, thus providing additional evidence for McCosh’s claim of the special role of common sense in the history of Scottish philosophy."

Experimental philosophy is a new movement that seeks to use empirical techniques to illuminate some of the oldest issues in philosophy. It is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of philosophy, psychology, and related disciplines, such as linguistics and sociology. Although the movement is only a few years old, it has already sparked an explosion of new research, challenging a number of cherished assumptions in both philosophy and the cognitive sciences. This volume includes both theoretical and experimental chapters as well as chapters that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries. It is divided into three parts that explore epistemology, moral and political philosophy, and metaphysics and mind, showcasing the diversity of work that has arisen as traditionally philosophical questions have met the tools of social science."
10.21814/eps.1.1.55,"ARE WE POST-JUSTIFICATION? STOUT’S CASE FOR SELF-KNOWLEDGE, POLITICAL JUSTIFICATION AND PUBLIC PHILOSOPHY","Must the participant to public discourse have knowledge of her beliefs, attitudes and reasons as well as belief-formation processes to have justified political belief? In this paper, we test this question with reference to Jeffrey Stout’s (2004) approach to public discourse and public philosophy. After defining self-knowledge and justification along the lines of James Pryor (2004), we map thereon Stout’s view of public discourse and public philosophy as democratic piety, earnest storytelling and Brandomian expressive rationality. We then lay out Brian Leiter’s (2016) naturalistic critique of public philosophy as “discursive hygiene” to see whether Stoutian public philosophy survives the former’s emotivist-tribalist gauntlet. Lastly, we find that Leiter’s critique proves less radical than it may appear and requires the moderating influence of a public philosophy like Stout’s. All in all, Stoutian public discourse and public philosophy powerfully illustrates a strong, necessary connection between self-knowledge and political justification. Post-truth is not post-justification."

10.30752/nj.69569,Slimy stones and philosophy: some interpretations of tohu wa-bohu,"The creation account in the first chapter of Genesis tells us how, from this state called tohu wa-bohu in Hebrew, God created and formed the world in the course of six days. To this is added a mythical statement, probably by a Babylonia Amora, Rav, about tohu as a green line encircling the world and bohu as wet stones immersed deep in water. During centuries, the Jews became exposed to philosophy and science which were built on Greek heritage. Almost a thousand years after Rav, Abraham bar Hiyya, a Spanish astronomer, presented tohu and bohu as identical to the Aristotelian matter and form. Jewish thinkers were sometimes discussing the physical reality, sometimes the divine reality, sometimes both. Tohu and bohu, which in the beginning were empty, without value and next to nothing, had grown to be the roots of being, the secret of knowledge both physical and divine."

Taking Whitehead’s claim of inscribing all problems of knowledge, of reality, and of experience within a “speculative scheme” seriously, this chapter is organized around a number of questions: How to inherit from speculative philosophy in the aftermath of the critiques that haven been formulated with respect to it in the beginning of the 20th century, most notably by pragmatism, Bergsonism, and phenomenology? Which are the instruments thanks to which speculative philosophy can enlarge the field of thought in order to account for experiences that transcend human limitations?"

10.21071/refime.v22i.6218,Compatibility Between Philosophy and Magic in the Work of Albertus Magnus,"Albertus Magnus (1193?-1280), also known as doctor universalis, delved into several fields of science and philosophy, a pursuit which resulted in a massive production of works. Within these works, however, one discerns a provocative paradox, in which a cleric is involved in a forbidden art: magic. In this paper I argue that a paradox of this kind can be justified and explained in terms of philosophy. To this end, I advance three case studies to shed light on the afore-mentioned problem. First, I scrutinize indirect and direct sources in order to clarify Albertus’s relation to magic, thus addressing whether it is possible to trace any supportive data that permits a connection between magic and philosophy. Next, I show that this connection is achievable, since some parts of Albertus’s philosophy, such as psychology, cosmology and the liberum arbitrium, seem to be associated with magia naturalis in terms of astrology. Finally, I argue that the German philosopher was not successful in legitimizing magic through philosophy, and thus failed to prove himself a unique pioneer of an innovative body of knowledge."

His first and most famous novel, The Name of the Rose (1980), had the merit of drawing the attention of the common reader to mediaeval thought, which is usually neglected and still not widely known. However, this portrayal was characterized by a negative and deforming image of medieval monasticism and its philosophical conceptions. By contrast the scholastic Middle Ages (Roger Bacon, Marsilius of Padua, and especially William of Ockham) were looked upon by Eco with very modern —even “postmodern”— eyes, so that very little was left of the Middle Ages themselves."

But the young Heidegger also maintained an important dialogue with medieval philosophy. This article is intended as an approximation to this last topic, in the light of the new volumes that appeared within the framework of the Gesamtausgabe. The heideggerian confrontation with medieval philosophy is primarly a philosophical confrontation and is changing according to the changes in Heidegger’s own philosophical conceptions. On the other hand, the article does not deal with the problem of Heidegger’s relationship with the medieval Mystic."

Even when the work adopts the form of a «protrepticon», its exposition on the «arts» points further tan what we can take as an elementary knowledge, not just in the skills a «master» should got at hand, but also in the subject matters taken regularly in the so called «french schools». Adelard’s conception of philosophy points to a renewal wich, in a sense, is going to be an example of a new attitude on the knowledge that the history of intellect has ascribe to the stream of changes attributed to the «Renaissance of the 12th Century»."

Hegel shares the «anti-medieval» prejudice prevailing in modern thought since the Renaissance and Reformation. In Hegel, the Protestant heritage is especially strong. Yet when he observes the subjectivist tendencies of modern Protestant theology, he proposes, as a counter-model, the more speculative and philosophical approaches of medieval thinkers.One can thus speak of a «vindication» of medieval philosophy in Hegel´s thought, despite his anti-medieval prejudice."

For Scotus, the object known is real, causes in the faculty the act of knowing; therefore, it is previous to the act. The truth consists in the similarity of the act of knowledge with the mental object: objectivism. With that thesis he separates of the previous medieval thought, for which the mental object is not real, but intentional: the mental object, not the act, is similar to the reality. This scotist´s thesis is a precedent of the posterior theory of knowledge."
10.12726/tjp.18.2, Role of Philosophy of Education in India,"One of the important aspects of educational philosophy is that it helps to construct a comprehensive system of education. During different periods, India has witnessed various stages of development. New priorities have emerged in education with the influences of monastic scholastic, realistic, idealistic and pragmatic trends. While education institutions have evolved, there remain several gaps between the philosophical ideals proposed by educational institutions and their everyday functioning. The paper brings forth the urgent need to bridge the gaps in order to attain a comprehensive philosophy of education, in principle and in action. The authors posit that the Indian philosophy of education, normatively speaking, could extend the culture and tradition of the philosophical positions of Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Sri Aurobindo and Swami Vivekananda. Such an approach could help in developing an integrated approach of teachers towards education and assist in strengthening their role in shaping the inner potential of a learner in a constructive manner."

&#x0D;
&#x0D;
A disciple of Titu Maiorescu (1840–1917), Petre Paul Negulescu, along with Constantin Radulescu-Motru (1868–1957) and Ion Petrovici (1882–1972), is regarded as being among the most prolific thinkers in Romanian modern thought and one of the founders of the modern Romanian culture. Historical changes he could never envisage have left their mark upon the perception, reception and interpretation of his work. The paper reviews the key characteristics of Petre Paul Negulescu’s work as reflected in his studies on the origin of culture, the philosophy of Renaissance and two magnificent works, The History of Contemporary Philosophy and The Destiny of Humanity. The aim is to contextualise these works within the field of philosophy in terms of their sources, conceptual approach and hermeneutics. As well as furnishing the Romanian culture with a wealth of original thought, his pertinent analysis of social, economic, cultural and political changes, and his involvement in improving the educational system through his position as Minister of Instruction, have made him worthy of criticism and an outstanding reference point in times of revival.&#x0D;

Macpherson and Philosophy, “Crypto” or Otherwise: A Response to Frank Cunningham","I have a high regard for Frank Cunningham and his work, on socialism, on democratic theory—and on C.B. Macpherson. To take one example, his new introductions to the recent reissues of Macpherson's books from Oxford University Press, including The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism and Democratic Theory: Essays in Retrieval, are excellent. Lucid and informative, they highlight the value Macpherson's ideas hold for contemporary political thought. So I am grateful that he has offered so fulsome a critical response to my book—even though he finds my approach, based on the idea that there is a suppressed philosophical dimension in Macpherson's work, though (dubiously) audacious, to be of limited accuracy or usefulness—indeed ultimately misguided. It results, he claims, in an analysis that “detracts from Macpherson's political-theoretical and political strengths.”"

Secara esensial, sesuatu itu tersusun atas substansi dan aksiden. Setiap sesuatu juga bergerak atau berubah. Di sini para filsuf berdebat tentang bagaimana sebuah gerak bisa terjadi. Apakah gerak terjadi hanya pada aksiden sesuatu tersebut seperti warna, bentuk, bobot, posisi, dan lain sebagainya, ataukah pada keduanya? Mullâ Ṣadrâ menyakini bahwa ketika sesuatu bergerak, gerak tersebut terjadi baik di tataran substansi maupun aksidennya. Bahkan, dari keduanya substansilah yang merupakan sumber. Gerak pada aksiden bersumber dari gerak substansi. Dalam filsafat Ṣadrâ, pembahasan tentang gerak terkait erat dengan kajian ontologi. Artikel ini akan mencoba menelusuri definisi dan latar ontologis gerak. Ini adalah riset kepustakaan. Data yang terkumpul akan dianalisis secara interpretatif untuk menjelaskan perubahan-perubahan gradual pada alam semesta khususnya pada diri manusia.

Co-branded between theOxford Philosophy Handbookand IPPP (International Perspectives in Philosophy and Psychiatry) book series, the volume includes a number of features designed to reflect the dynamic two-way interplay between theory and practice that has emerged as such a key feature of the new field. Thus, 1) the topics covered include many of the standard problems of philosophy (such as consciousness, other minds, freedom, and personal identity) but these are organised into sections reflecting the stages of the clinical encounter (from first contact, through psychopathology and diagnosis to causation and thence to care and cure); 2) although predominantly philosophical in focus each chapter draws in different ways on practice-informed expertise (including clinical, scientific and service user perspectives); 3) the development of the book was supported by an international advisory board including a mental health NGO as well as academic organisations; and 4) the book is further supported by a unique web-site resource of first-hand narratives of mental disorder and other practice-based materials. In incorporating these features,The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Psychiatryaims not merely to reflect the current state of the field but also to drive its further development as a distinctively philosophical contribution to twenty-first century mental health."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190464745.013.19,The Philosophy of Mind-Wandering,"This chapter provides an introduction to the philosophy of mind-wandering. It begins with a philosophical critique of the standard psychological definitions of mind-wandering as task-unrelated thought or stimulus-independent thought. Although these definitions have helped bring mind-wandering research onto center stage in psychology and cognitive neuroscience, they have substantial limitations. They do not account for the dynamics of mind-wandering, task-unrelated thought that does not qualify as mind-wandering, or the ways in which mind-wandering can be task-related. The chapter reviews philosophical accounts that improve upon the current psychological definitions, in particular an account of mind-wandering as “unguided thinking.” It critically assesses the view that mind-wandering can be defined as thought lacking meta-awareness and cognitive agency, as well as the view that mind-wandering is disunified thinking. The definition of mind-wandering as unguided thinking not only is conceptually and phenomenologically precise, but also can be operationalized in a principled way for empirical research."

It also contends that both realms of experience, the psychological internal and the political external, infuse each other and each depends on the other."
10.3846/23450479.2016.1241834,HOW PHILOSOPHY CAN HELP IN CREATIVE THINKING,"In this paper we aim to show that philosophy can be helpful in creative thinking. Although we take into account only selected philosophical concepts and rules, we will try to demonstrate that a person who has a good command over these few ideas can formulate new ideas and projects when confronted with new and demanding situations. Correspondingly, the ability to think abstractly in some specific circumstances can lead to positive and unexpected results. In this way, the mind “plasticity” that results from a philosophical education can become an engine of creativity. This article concerns people who study philosophy (formally or informally) and who in their professional lives are involved in various jobs and activities where creative thinking is needed and even required. In general, the paper is a part of philosophical heuristics."
10.12681/historein.217,Explorations between philosophy and history,"This introduction summarizes the basic ideas behind the articles collected in &lt;em&gt;Przekraczanie granic: eseje z filozofii historii i teorii historiografii&lt;/em&gt; [Bordercrossings: essays on the philosophy of history and theory of historiography]. The first basic idea is the idea that the writing of history has a “border crossing” character, meaning that history writing involves border crossings, first, between history and philosophy and, second, between history and “politics” in a broad sense. The second basic idea is that the dialectical mechanism of “inversion” (of “negation” and of “the unity of opposites”) is fundamental for our understanding of debates in the philosophy of history and in historiography. The third idea is that interesting prejudices and other assumptions in both philosophy and in history are found by contrast, not by analysis (Feyerabend). Analysis of controversies is therefore the most fruitful point of departure in the philosophy of history and in historiography. Because all key ideas in the humanities are “essentially contested concepts” (Gallie), controversies are the “normal” discursive condition in the humanities.&lt;!--[endif] --&gt;"
10.11634/216796061706158,OHAZURUME: The Philosophy and Practice of Decision Making and Consensus Building among the Ndigbo of Nigeria,"This paper studies the OHAZURUME philosophy and practice of decision making and consensus building among the Ndigbos (the Igbos) of Nigeria. OHAZURUME, which literarily means ‘it is the communal will; is a, philosophy and practice that ensures that decisions are easily accepted because of its collective properties.  Because the issue is decided collectively by the ‘oha’ [the people], no individual can upturn it.   OHAZURUME draws from the overall ‘ohaka’[the community is supreme] philosophy and  is predicated on the conditions that the matter is tabled openly for discussion, that EVERYBODY  is allowed to contribute and that the preponderance of public opinion is upheld as the communal judgment. This paper adopts the participant observation and interview methods and identifies a simple, Nine-stage process of OHAZURUME and establishes that  as in other decentralized systems, individual rights and views are respected; individuals accept and respect the  communal interest;  dissent is accommodated; there is direct participation in decision making  and every eligible male has equal right. The paper also undertakes a comparative analysis and discovers that OHAZURUME shares the basic features of other consensus building models like Japanese, Quaker, and CODM, which include group ownership of decisions, participation, and respect for dissention.  The paper avers that the key attraction of OHAZURUME is its simplicity. The implication of this study, especially for an international audience is that it develops and articulates a new management concept and practice, enlarges the  consensus literature, identifies management philosophies and practices from other climes and expands the dimensions to comparative management."

It isn’t fully clear, however, whether it differs from analytic philosophy of religion in some important way. Is analytic theology really just a sub-field of analytic philosophy of religion, or can it be distinguished from the latter in virtue of fundamental differences at the level of subject matter or methodology? These are pressing questions for the burgeoning field of analytic theology. The aim of this article, then, will be to map out several forms that analytic theology might (and in some cases actually does) take before examining the extent to which each can be thought to be distinct from analytic philosophy of religion."

There are, however, metaphors that do not suit the objects they should represent, which thus impacts the accuracy of the knowledge which derives from these objects. It is the case of the machine metaphor, when resorted to in the study of living organisms. Canguilhem has tackled problems it created in twentieth-century life sciences head on. In his criticism, he links the analysis of Descartes’ work to his own philosophical thesis on “biological normativity”. By doing so, he so sheds a light on the pitfalls, both historical and biological, over which the machine metaphor stumbles. He thereby orders sciences to periodically make sure of the relevance of their metaphors and explanatory models to their objects."
10.1515/jbcpp-2017-0143,The case for a distinctive philosophy of physiology and pathophysiology,"Abstract
What is an organ and what is an organ system? According to the ‘standard’ hierarchical model of physiology, each living organism comprises of organ systems including those that offer sensory and control functions (nervous system), energy accumulation (gastrointestinal system), internal dissipation (circulatory system) and mobility (musculoskeletal system). Each organ system in turn is comprised of individual organs. This taxonomy has conceptual flaws as not every organ has a single organ system function but may participate in a myriad of physiological functions. To answer this philosophical question, several principles are applied. At one level, the assessment of physiological function and organ system can be considered to have some relation to the broader issue of the species problem in the philosophy of biology. Additionally, however, there is a relationship to the more fundamental issue of the biochemistry of each organ that can be considered through the philosophy of chemistry. The philosophy of physiology can therefore be considered to occupy a position somewhere between these two strata of thought on the path of science reductionism. A distinctive philosophy of physiology and pathophysiology may ultimately offer a myriad of new pathways through which to better explore the metaphysical elements of medicine and science."

The matter manipulation is not limited to the actual “matter”. Brothers Quay perceive the acting “matters” as symbols and signs of human activities and relationships. For them, there is no fundamental difference between “matters” and living beings inhabiting their films. Matter manipulation is the process of “machine” production, reproduction, destruction, repair and deconstruction. The creation process acts as a magic spell, in which objects are transformed into something else. The Street of Crocodiles (1986) is an example of deep understanding of lifelessness as a mask, a kind of conspiracy, behind which unknown life forms hide. Brothers Quay’ creative works tell us about autonomous existence of objects beyond their direct utilitarian purpose. The article will be devoted to such problems as synergistic vision of the world in which the material and the spiritual are inseparable. Despite the paradox of visual embodiment, it fits into a philosophical metatheory of the “new materialism”, which transversely crosses streams of matter and mind, body and soul, nature and culture. The legacy of Brothers Quay open to us the world of ordinary, “banal” things, signs of time on their body shell, in contradiction with the dominance of endless consumption of new, intrusive advertising and cult of youth, in which there is no room for “sign of the times”.

The author discusses aspects of pretemporal life of awareness and discloses philosophical time travel in order to engage in a dialogue with others. The argument of this paper makes the following points: a) empirically it is not possible to leave our chronological position; b) human memory is quite limited; c) yet we dialogue with members of our species through times in terms of our “signitive” capacity; d) we read texts that “mean” events, things and others and thus engage in a dialogue with them. All this implies that we are aware of what other said or saw and made accessible “through” the empirical signs prior to asking a question of “when” – this means “atemporally”.

10.1093/oso/9780190225100.003.0006,Pleasure in Later Medieval Latin Philosophy,"This contribution examines, through a discussion of Thomas Aquinas’s teaching, what philosophers in the later Middle Ages thought about the nature of pleasure. Generally speaking, Aquinas and his contemporaries consider pleasures as passions of the soul. After exploring what this means for their understanding of pleasure, it is explained how this approach to pleasure is compatible with two aspects we often associate with pleasure: perfection and feeling. The essay then turns to the distinction between different kinds of pleasures, especially between sensory and intellectual pleasures. This leads to the question of where pleasures are located in the soul and to the idea, defended by some authors, that truly human pleasures belong to the will. Finally, by way of concluding, some brief indications are given as to how other later medieval philosophers further develop or react to the views on pleasure that we can find in Aquinas’s works."

This chapter considers the parallels that Berkeley draws between sensible quality perceptions and pleasures/pains. Importantly, Berkeley holds that we can have intuitive or demonstrative knowledge of the existence and nature of the physical world on the basis of our sensory perceptions. His parallel analysis of pleasures and pains thus surprisingly implies that these, too, can provide us with intuitive or demonstrative knowledge of the physical world. Taking pleasures and pains to have an epistemic and cognitive function allows us to reread certain Berkeleyan texts in ways that are illuminating. This includes texts on the laws of nature, which enable us to regulate actions precisely because knowledge of the natural laws involves generalizing over regularities of sensory perceptions, which include pleasures/pains."

This period was characterized by the development of a variety of Buddhist philosophical schools and approaches that have shaped Buddhist thought up to the present day: the scholasticism of the Abhidharma, the Madhyamaka’s theory of emptiness, Yogācāra idealism, and the logical and epistemological works of Diṅnāga and Dharmakīrti. The book attempts to describe the historical development of these schools in their intellectual context, with particular emphasis on three factors that shaped the development of Buddhist philosophical thought: the need to spell out the contents of canonical texts, the discourses of the historical Buddha and the Mahāyāna sutras; the desire to defend their positions by sophisticated arguments against criticisms from fellow Buddhists and from non-Buddhist thinkers of classical Indian philosophy; and the need to account for insights gained through the application of specific meditative techniques. While the main emphasis of our presentation is the period up the the sixth century CE, we will we also discuss some important selected figures who influenced Buddhist thought between this time and the decline of Buddhist scholastic philosophy in India at the beginning of the thirteenth century."

Basing its main argument on the work of Pierre Hadot, the study argues that ancient philosophers understood philosophy primarily as the ‘art of living’, a way of life, which, in turn, points to the importance of classical virtue theory in this respect. The chapter also examines the question of how Graeco-Roman philosophers described the character of the philosophical sage, focusing on such descriptions in the first and second century, using the writings of Seneca as an example. Descriptions of the philosophical sage are most prominent in Stoic sources."

On the ethical front, al-Rāzī, Ibn Bājja, Ibn Ṭufayl, and the Brethren of Purity are shown to have presented remarkable defenses of benevolence towards animals. Regarding psychology, the chapter explores the range of cognitive powers ascribed to animals, focusing on the higher faculties that overlap with the so-called “internal senses” in humans."

This chapter is a dialogue on this and related questions. Has the present economic system reversed the means–end relation between markets and life? What forms of reasoning and value might redress this? Given our growing awareness and relations, what responsibilities do we have toward people in other parts of the planet? Will enterprises face a sunset on the notion of limited liability? The chapter discusses the marketing economy’s manufacture of needs and the seeming overfinancialization of the economy. It concludes by proposing that if something is necessary to act morally, it is rational for us to believe in it. The spontaneous outcomes of the free market have to be evaluated against our societal goals, and the process reshaped via education and not only regulation."

Each volume features original essays that contribute to an understanding of a wide range of themes and problems in all periods of ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, from the beginnings to the threshold of the Middle Ages. From its first volume in 1983, OSAP has been a highly influential venue for work in the field, and has often featured essays of substantial length as well as critical essays on books of distinctive importance. Volume LIV contains: an article on the equal sticks argument for Forms in Plato’s Phaedo; an article on why Plato abandoned the Socratic method; and another on the cognition of the world soul in the Timaeus; two articles on Aristotle’s Posterior Analytics, one on the prohibition against ‘kind‐crossing’, the other on the requirements for a middle term’s being an explanatory cause; an article on the mixture of elemental qualities in Aristotle’s On Generation and Corruption 2. 7, and another on First Philosophy in Metaphysics Lambda; and an article on Alexander of Aphrodisias’ use of dialectical method in his treatises On Fate and On Providence."

It outlines an extensive project in First Philosophy, which has close connections with ΑΒΓΕ‎, but which proceeds on a different trajectory from ΖΗ‎. The principal problem in understanding λ‎ as a whole is how to reconcile Aristotle's explicit presentation of the book as a highly unified study with the disparate character of its two halves – the first a general‐metaphysical enquiry into the features which changeable substances have as being substances of that kind (and also into what can be said generally about their attributes), the second a detailed investigation of the specific character and activity of immaterial substances. My paper aims to show how this reconciliation is possible, and what we can learn about Aristotle's conception of first philosophy as a result."

Next, Putnam’s changing views on modality are surveyed, moving from the modal pre-formal to the de-modalized formal characterization of logical validity. Section three suggests a complementary view of Platonism and modalism underlying different stages of a dynamic mathematical practice. The final section argues for the pervasive platonistic conception of the working mathematician."

However, Kant does not elaborate his conception of the whole of reason. Nor does the secondary literature.

This necessary standard is the discipline of pure reason."

It takes its point of departure in the most important factors that influenced and shaped the Patristic thought. Subsequently, the paper considers the relative autonomy of Byzantine philosophy and offers a brief profile of major philosophers that contributed to the stream in the period from 9th to 15th century. From the numerous subjects that were taken into account by the most prominent Byzantine philosophers, the article discusses such issues as: the view of God, the problem of ‘conceptual realism’, the relationship between such ‘disci  plines’ as logic, metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics and philosophical anthro  pology. Furthermore, such questions as the place of man in the world, the scope of their freedom and the problem of evil are also touched upon here. The paper concludes with some remarks on the develop  ment of Byzantine philosophy after the fall of Byzantium."

The investigation provides a basis for distinguishing two majorperiods in his activity. The one preceding the Delphic oracle consists inconducting inquiries in a group of closest friends. The one following theDelphic oracle consist in addressing a much larger audience. An analysisof both periods suggests that the oracle from Delphi greatly affectedSocrates’ relations with other Athenians. While the present article dealsalso with the issue of Socrates’ daimonion, it hypothesizes that the voiceof daimonion and the voice of Pythia could be regarded as Apollo’sinterventions."

10.14746/pea.2013.1.10,Philosophy and Ataraxia in Sextus Empiricus,"This essay addresses two interconnected questions: (a) In what sense is Skepticism a philosophy? (b) How can ataraxia emerge out of epochē? Skepticism is a practice that articulates three moments: equipollence, epochē (suspension of judgment), and ataraxia (freedom from disturbance) and Sextus’ account of how one can move through these moments demonstrates the its philosophical nature. However, to clarify the transition from epochē to ataraxia Sextus offers only one clue: the story of Apelles. If this story is paradigmatic, it is also ambiguous since the transition from epochē to ataraxia can neither be causal nor inferential. Apelles achieves his goal purely by chance. Contrary to a common interpretation, this doesn’t mean that the Skeptic abandons the inquiry (just as Apelles doesn’t abandon painting). Lastly, the essay argues that Skepticism is not only the practice of a certain dialectical method but also a practice upon oneself. The Skeptic must learn to dissociate herself from the thoughts she entertains. Sustained inquiry can coexist with ataraxia because the Skeptic has discovered that her consciousness is distinct from its intentional content now bracketed by epochē. To free ourselves from our attachment to dogmatic beliefs is to opens up a space of self-detachment.  "

10.31219/osf.io/w2cvu,Interpretations of the concepts of resilience and evolution in the philosophy of Leibniz,"In this article I interpret resilience and evolution in view of the philosophy of Leibniz. First, I discuss resilience as a substance’s or a monad’s “quantity of essence” — its “degree of perfection” — which I express as the quality of the Whole with respect to the sum of the qualities of the Parts. Then I discuss evolution, which I interpret here as the autopoietic Principle that sets Itself in motion and creates all reality, including Itself. This Principle may be considered as a sort of ante-litteram metaphysical Darwinian Selection. My interpretations provide a different formulation for questions such as “why natural evolution evolves?” and “why is this the best of all possible worlds?” In this article I also provide a geometrical interpretation of a key aspect behind the “divine mathematics” of the autopoietic Principle."

It aims to make progress on philosophical questions by using experimental methods traditionally associated with the psychological and behavioral sciences, such as null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Motivated by recent discussions about a methodological crisis in the behavioral sciences, questions have been raised about the methodological standards of x-phi. Here, we focus on one aspect of this question, namely the rate of inconsistencies in statistical reporting. Previous research has examined the extent to which published articles in psychology and other behavioral sciences present statistical inconsistencies in reporting the results of NHST. In this study, we used the R package statcheck to detect statistical inconsistencies in x-phi, and compared rates of inconsistencies in psychology and philosophy. We found that rates of inconsistencies in x-phi are lower than in the psychological and behavioral sciences. From the point of view of statistical reporting consistency, x-phi seems to do no worse, and perhaps even better, than psychological science."

10.31231/osf.io/x7vj3,The Philosophy of Mind-Wandering,"This chapter provides an introduction to the philosophy of mind-wandering. It begins with a philosophical critique of the standard psychological definitions of mind-wandering as task-unrelated thought or stimulus-independent thought. Although these definitions have helped bring mind-wandering research onto center stage in psychology and cognitive neuroscience, they have substantial limitations. They do not account for the dynamics of mind-wandering, task-unrelated thought that does not qualify as mind-wandering, or the ways in which mind-wandering can be task-related. The chapter reviews philosophical accounts that improve upon the current psychological definitions, in particular an account of mind-wandering as “unguided thinking.” It critically assesses the view that mind-wandering can be defined as thought lacking meta-awareness and cognitive agency, as well as the view that mind-wandering is disunified thinking. The definition of mind-wandering as unguided thinking not only is conceptually and phenomenologically precise, but also can be operationalized in a principled way for empirical research."

This novel is able to describe the social condition of the society. The story in Pasar novel is really simple. The storyline is a Javanese society, represented by a sub-district, Gemolong District. People who play in it was not much. However, it cann’t be denied, the novel is full of meaning, especially about the values of Java which has been considered very noble. These Javanese values concern the issue of attitude, soul, and culture. Kuntowijoyo is indeed a Javanese. As a writer and culturalist, he is able to integrate the cultural reality that takes place in his society by cleverly composing the word into a compelling novel. Without impressed patronizing, the reader seemed to be invited to remember and reflect on the Javanese values that began to fade left by the Javanese themselves. Javanese values revealed in this Pasar novel are values that should be held firm and become the basis for the Javanese in navigating his life. These values include (1) self-awareness (as best a deed is to see oneself) as students must have an honest character, tolerance and discipline, (2) a life of samadya, honest, willing to sacrifice, answer, also about the secrets of life, and so on."

10.31608/pjcp.v1i1.4,The Difference of Feminist Philosophy: The Case of Shame,"This essay is written in two parts. The first is a commentary on the affective politics of philosophy as a discipline. The theme here is philosophy’s reverence problem, an affective bond to the teacher and the text, which is threatened or even injured by feminist philosophy. Feminist philosophy emerges as disruptive irreverence in the midst of the discipline, and injured reverence becomes a powerful prereflective motivation for resistance to feminist thought. The second part of the essay is an exploration of the field of inquiry called feminist phenomenology. Is feminist phenomenology simply phenomenology from another point of view, that of the embodied female subject? Is it conducted, in other words, in a space beyond politics and power where the difference of this subject discloses values and meanings that have not yet been thematized in phenomenological inquiry, but which phenomenology is already competent to pursue? Or does feminist phenomenology disrupt or transform phenomenological practice as we traditionally understand it? In this paper, I claim that phenomenology must be critical in order to be feminist, that it must disrupt phenomenological practice rather than simply “applying” it to a new object, “woman.” In the work of Simone de Beauvoir we find a different phenomenological practice that feminists can count as a positive inheritance. The real difference of feminist phenomenology, however, only emerges in the practice itself. In order to capture something about this difference I take the phenomenon of shame as a case study, and compare three recent phenomenological accounts of shame."

One of theseinfluence areas is education studies. Education has been influenced by the philosophy of education, which hasoccurred more specifically than philosophy. Educational leaders and pre-service teachers should notice theavailability of using this influence and the educational philosophy as a tool. This research was conducted in order todetermine the perception of educational philosophy in the industrial age 4.0 and to find the educational philosophyproductivity of pre-service teachers. The study group includes 111 pre-service teachers who take the trainingphilosophy course in the 2nd class level in the Faculty of Education of Mustafa Kemal University in Turkey. 72 ofthese pre-service teachers are female, and 39 are male. This research where quantitative and qualitative data are usedtogether is a mixed educational research. In the study, a 25-question test developed by the researcher and asemi-structured interview form consisting of 3 questions has been used to collect data. While the pre-test andpost-test studies were conducted with the test which is the data collection tool, the data were analyzed by using thedescriptive analysis and the content analysis of the data obtained from the interview form. When the findings of thestudy were taken into consideration, it was found that there was a significant difference between pre-test scores andpost-test scores of the pre-service teachers participating in the research. The teaching process of the trainingphilosophy course given has been found to be successful. It has been concluded that pre-service teachers haveexpressed the philosophy and education relationship with human-based views. It has been found that pre-serviceteachers prefer the ""progressive training philosophy"" if they want to make a new educational design. However, it hasbeen determined that pre-service teachers did not have an idea about technology and technological developments inthe industrial age 4.0."

It deals with the epistemological, material, political, and categorical conditions of permeability, some of which initiate a separation of historical science from philosophy, whereas others allow, on the one hand, for history to profit from philosophy and, on the other, for philosophy to profit from history. The article illustrates how both history and philosophy benefit through reciprocal openness within education as an academic field.

10.30664/ar.67468,A postcolonial philosophy of religion and interreligious polylogue," In this article, an agenda for the development of a philosophy of religion which is informed by the challenges and possibilities of religious plurality is suggested. It is argued that the philosophy of religion as an academic discipline is in need of a kind of reconstruction if it is to maintain its relevance and connection to actual religious phenomena as they present themselves globally. The problem originates in the fact that the modern concept of religions has a distorting effect when applied to non-western traditions. The article focuses on a way to understand religious diversity by using aspects of Heidegger’s fundamental ontology to illuminate different ways of being religious within the same tradition and also to find similar religious dispositions across traditions. It is argued that this can inform interreligious dialogue so that this dialogue—or rather, polylogue—itself can serve as a tool to develop a postcolonial existential philosophy of religion. Part of this project would be to find and apply concepts and categories by reading religious traditions and subtraditions through each other. The article ends with a few suggestions on how this can be done, in this case by drawing on traditions from India.Willy Pfändtner is Senior Lecturer, Study of Religions, Södertörn University, Sweden.

10.31192/np.15.2.5,Reflection on the Artistic Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche,"Friedrich Nietzsche je vrlo dojmljiva osoba suvremene filozofije. Njegova misao usmjerena je na kritiku europskog čovjeka oblikovanog metafizičkim naslijeđem. S druge strane, on pokušava, u vlastitom suočavanju sa zbiljnošću, donijeti novu perspektivu mišljenja. Ono se u intuitivnom ophođenju sa svijetom želi ozbiljiti po uzoru na umjetnički zadatak. Cilj je filozofa iskristalizirati svoju umjetničku bit, pri čemu stvaralački mora postaviti nove vrijednosti. Iznimna neprozirnost Nietzscheova djela, filozofije koja se više skriva negoli otkriva, onemogućuje sustavni prikaz njegova filozofijskog opusa. Razlog tomu jest Nietzscheov upravo nesustavni i pjesnički neiskaziv odnos sa zbiljnošću u skladu s razmatranjem nemogućnosti njezina oblikovanja pojmovnim kategorijama koje bi se istinito odnosile na njezinu bit. Svjestan nemogućnosti oslonca na metafiziku, kojoj je pripisao jedino moralistički i vrijednosno-sustavni odnos sa svijetom, pokušava Nietzsche iznijeti diskurs budućeg razumijevanja u znaku intuitivnog prepoznavanja i opravdanosti paradoksa koji se nalazi u heraklitovskoj biti života, čime ujedno iznalazi umjetničku potvrdu života kao velebne igre gradeće-razarajućeg pra-temelja."

Perhaps it is most valuable because it reveals some of the foundational assumptions that run so deep in the poles of comparison that they might otherwise have gone unnoticed. These revelations may invite us to challenge those assumptions that have led to the kind of thinking responsible for much of the environmental degradation that we see today. Japanese Environmental Philosophy gathers papers focused on the environmental problems of the twenty-first century. Drawing from Japanese philosophical traditions they investigate our relationships with other humans, nonhuman animals, and the environment. The heart of the book consists of chapters written by fifteen top scholars from Japan, the United States, Europe, and Australia. The essays cover a broad range of topics drawn from various strains of Japanese thought—including Zen Buddhism, Shintoism, the Kyoto school, and Japanese philosophy of art and aesthetics—as well as from traditional Japanese culture and the contemporary science of planning for natural disasters. These articles demonstrate that Japanese scientific, philosophical, religious, and cultural traditions can provide meaningful insight to address the current global environmental crisis."
10.1515/auk-2018-0008,Value Pluralism and Philosophy of History,"Abstract
				In my reply to George Crowder’s criticism of my essay on the Soviet Revolution in the last issue of Analyse &amp; Kritik, I discuss two problems: the nature of a reasonable value pluralism and the relation between ethics and philosophy of history. Concerning the first, I insist on the necessity of an objective rank ordering of values; with regard to the second, I side with Kant, who builds philosophy of history on ethics, and reject the Marxist idea that ethics is itself grounded in philosophy of history."

10.4312/as.2012.-16.1.29-41,論戴震 (1723–1777) 之考證哲學及其反思/On Dai Zhen’s (1723–1777) Philosophy of Evidential Research and Its Reflection,"摘要清代乾嘉時期之學風係以考證知名。之所以如此，主要由於乾嘉學者不滿宋、明學者以哲學思辯之方式研究儒學典籍，而未能把握原始儒學之真貌，故轉而以考證之方式來研究儒家之原典，其目的在於欲恢復原始儒學之真貌。在乾嘉時期，戴震雖被視為最重要之考證學者之一，然戴氏為學之旨趣，實超出考證學之外，而欲以之作為彰顯儒學原貌之方法學。戴氏明言，其為學之方法乃是一語言學或訓詁之方法，亦即欲以訓詁之方法來研究哲學之問題，以之作為彰顯原始儒學真相之最佳方法，並由此建立其考證哲學，其目的即欲以本身之哲學來取代宋、明理學。依此，本文旨在探究戴震在重建原始儒學之努力，並針對戴氏之考證哲學作一反思，以明其價值及限制。關鍵詞：考證學、復古主義、理學、漢學、考證哲學Dai Zhen was known as a leading proponent of the evidential research (kaozheng) school during the Qian Jia Era. However, he regarded kaozheng as primarily a means of revealing the truth. Moreover, he was regarded as a philosopher rather than as merely a kaozheng, or textual, scholar. In this respect, his philosophical writings reflect an attempt to substitute his own philosophy for the Song Philosophy of Principle (lixue). Dai Zhen’s philosophical writings indicate the impact philology had on philosophical issues. The methodology Dai Zhen adopted was essentially linguistic, that is, xungu (etymology, lit., “glossing”). The merit of this methodology was that it would trace back the original meanings of key terms in the Classics, and this in turn, would benefit the understanding of the Confucian tradition. The aim of this paper is to explore Dai Zhen’s attempt to reconstruct the Confucian tradition, and to assess his philosophy of evidential research in order to manifest its value and limitation. "
10.4312/as.2011.-15.2.101-122,The Ideological Foundations of Taiwanese Modernity:  Mou Zongsan’s New Moral Philosophy,"In order to understand the social, political and intellectual process of Chinese modernization, it is necessary to evaluate their ideological foundations and to thus become able to place it in the suitable political context. Chinese philosophy of the first half of the 20th century was still determined by the conditions of the decline of the pre-modern era. The present article aims to explore and to introduce the rise and growth of Modern Confucianism, as well as some crucial philosophical elaborations in the field of the new moral philosophy, developed by the most well-known exponent of its so-called 2nd generation, Mou Zongsan."
10.4312/as.2015.3.1.105-128,Phenomenon of Life and Death by Dōgen and Heidegger––In View of “Embodied Cognition” in Buddhist Philosophy and Phenomenology,"Contrary to occidental philosophy, which is to grasp and solidify the principles of essential being (ontos on), Buddhism seeks to understand the existence of human beings and the significance of suffering in human life. In the East Asian languages human beings are described as “inter-beings” in that they are enveloped by the topos of life and death. From breath to breath, our life is bound to the moments of emerging and vanishing, being and non-being in an essential unity. Dōgen’s philosophical thinking integrated this conception with the embodied cognition of both the thinking and the acting self. In the phenomenological point of view, Heidegger, in his early work, emphasizes that being is bound to a fundamental substantiality, which borders on the Abgrund, falling into nothingness. With Dōgen, the unity-within-contrast of life and death is exemplified in our breathing because it achieves a unity of body and cognition which can be called “corpus”. In perfect contrast, the essential reflection for Heidegger is that of grasping the fundament of being in the world, which represents the actualization of a thinking-being-unity. The goal of this comparison is to fundamentally grasp what is the essentiality of being, life, and recognition (jikaku 自覚), bound to embodied cognition in our globalized world."
10.4312/as.2016.4.1.97-112,The Significance of “mushin”: The Essential Mind of Zen Buddhist Philosophy for Humans in a Contemporary World,"In our time of an information highway, digital networks are linked around the clock. Among various data many people are unconsciously depending on IT and digital medias with their body––but without any mind. The human origin, its creative thinking and acting, transmitting one idea to another for reforming and developing something new has been quite forgotten. Against this omnipresent phenomenon the Zen Buddhist Philosophy of Mind shows a dynamic approach to re-create and re-construct a human life, accompanied by the unique concept of the absolute one, “mu” (無), mu-shin (無心), the mind of mu presents a dynamic unity in its flexible activity."
10.4312/as.2016.4.2.95-108,The Logic of “Mutual Transmission” in Huayan and Zen Buddhist Philosophy – Toward the Logic of Co-existence in a Globalized World,"Is it true that in the history of East Asian cultures there was less “philosophy”, less “logic” and “rationality” before the process of modernization began in the nineteenth century? A number of scholars of East Asian Studies believe this is a form of prejudice. For example, Nishida Kitarō stated that in East Asian cultures there is another form of logic, which can be called the “logicus spiritus” (心の論理). This article examines the essential parts of this logic with regard to Huayan and Zen Buddhist philosophy, and is thus an effort at comparative philosophy."
10.4312/as.2017.5.1.67-80,The Early Zhou Period: Origin of the Idea of Political Legitimacy and the Political Philosophy of Confucianism,"The Chunqiu and Zhanguo Periods are usually regarded as the birth of Chinese philosophy, especially with regard to practical or moral philosophy. If we think about the concept of political legitimacy in the Early Zhou Period, with ideas like the “Mandate of Heaven”, “respect virtue” and “protect ruled people”, then this Period is not only the origin of this in ancient China, but also of Chinese philosophy, and primarily the political philosophy of Confucianism. The paper will first explain some documents in the “inscriptions on ancient bronze objects” in order to prove that the ideas of the “Mandate of Heaven”, “respect virtue” and “protect ruled people” really originated from this time. Through analysis of several Zhou documents from the Book of the Documents the paper will then demonstrate that these ideas are the three most important innovations in the history of Chinese thinking at that time."
10.4312/as.2017.5.1.147-171,In the Shadow of the Decay. The Philosophy of History of Mencius and Xunzi,"The aim of my paper is to analyze the debate between Mencius and Xunzi from the perspective of their views on the nature of the historical process. The Mencian approach embraces not only elaboration on the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven, resulting in a cyclical vision of history, but also strong idealization of the past. I will show that ren (benevolence), treated as a historical principle, could link two dimensions of his historical thinking: the moral and ontological. Xunzi rejected the possibility of the intervention of Heaven in history, however, his theory of rituals and belief in moral use of history made his philosophy of history much more conservative, embalming the idealization of the past. In short, I will look for the main common points and differences between these two major figures of Confucianism regarding their views on history, attempting to answer which beliefs could constitute a unique Confucian philosophy of history."

In most of the discussions, the controversy over what constitutes an African philosophy tends to dominate, sometimes so much that it forms almost the entire content of the course."
10.1093/oso/9780190690649.003.0010,Philosophy of Mathematics,"Philosophy of mathematics deals both with ontological issues (what is it that mathematics studies?) and epistemological issues (how is mathematical knowledge possible?). This chapter reviews the main answers given to these two sets of issues, stressing how interrelated they are. It starts from the classical opposition between empiricist, rational, and critical approaches to set the sage and poses the question of mathematics’ relationship with experience as well as the one of the respective roles of intuition and logical principles. A detailed account of two anti-realist programs (finitism and intuitionism) is provided. Arguments in favor of realism are presented, and distinct realist views are distinguished. Having confronted the epistemological difficulties of various realist views, the last part of the chapter deals with naturalist perspectives and mathematical structuralism."
10.1093/oso/9780190690649.003.0017,Philosophy of Linguistics,"This chapter is an enquiry into the goals and methods of linguistics, with the aim of understanding both the specifics of the discipline and the relationships between linguists’ take on the methodology of their field and general principles of philosophy of science. The first part highlights linguistics as an inquiry into language, as opposed to languages. The second part describes the shift from structural linguistics to generative grammar as a paradigm shift, involving major changes in both what is studied and how it is studied. The next section focuses on the empirical import of contemporary linguistics, discussing standards of explanation and prediction, as well as confirmation and refutation of linguistic hypotheses. The last part introduces linguistic universals, what they are and how they may be identified and explained, thus making explicit the connection with the goal of understanding not only the variety of languages but the faculty of language."
10.1093/oso/9780190690649.003.0013,Philosophy of Medicine,"This chapter views philosophy of medicine as a domain within philosophy of science as opposed to a province of bioethics. Thus, it first deals with the philosophical analysis of health, disease, and illness concepts and with the scientific nature of medicine. Relative to the second theme, it addresses questions relative to the causes and explanations of disease and the status of theories in biomedical science. A central concern here is the status and nature of proof in medicine and the relationship between theory and practice at the heart of evidence-based medicine. Finally, the chapter focuses on the specific problems raised by causal analysis and experimentation in medicine and on the nature of clinical reasoning."
10.1093/oso/9780190690649.003.0007,Philosophy of Science and Science Studies,"Science studies have proposed a novel and integrated outlook on scientific activity, to be described in a quasi-anthropological way and without the supposed normative prejudice of most philosophers of science. This chapter examines the stiff competition between philosophy of science and science studies in accounting for what science really is about. This competition is best framed at a methodological level, in particular in terms of the relationship between the study of science and its history. Should one strive for ahistorical generalizations or focus on the irremediably singular low-level interactions that constitute the day-to-day business of scientific life? Should one accept to practice “judged history,” and put past theories in perspective with what we learned to be right and wrong about them, or should one refrain from any such overseeing perspective? The chapter concludes with prospects for accounting from within philosophy of science for the important phenomena that science studies have contributed."
10.1093/oso/9780190690649.003.0015,Philosophy of Economics,"Although there are no doubts regarding the impact of economics in society and politics, doubts regarding its epistemological status endure. Does economics provide us with bona fide empirical theories? Are its mathematical models on a par with those of the hard sciences, or is its scientific character exaggerated? This chapter focuses on the key problem of the philosophy of economics: the reconciliation of its claim to empirical significance with what often appears as a non-empirical methodology, favoring deduction from a priori principles and showing little sensitivity to refutation by observation and experiment. Several attempts at answering this problem are considered, both in the Millian tradition and following neo-positivist approaches. Finally, the empirical status of the discipline is put in perspective with its recent extension to new fields of inquiry, such as behavioral economics and neuroeconomics, where experiments seem to be part of the core methodology."
10.1093/oso/9780190690649.003.0011,Philosophy of Physics,"Philosophical reflections on physics and its theories have been shaping the agenda of general philosophy of science, including issues such as the nature of scientific theories, the meaning of scientific terms, and scientific modeling. But physics is also well worth being considered a special science of its own, whose methods and tools raised specific questions for philosophers of science: this is the approach followed in this chapter, which has as its main thread the role of mathematics in physical theories. It tackles classical issues concerning measurement and determinism and long-standing controversies in the philosophy of statistical mechanics (how may the reversible laws of mechanics account for the irreversible principles of thermodynamics?) and in the philosophy of quantum physics (does quantum mechanics provide us a with a complete description of quantum phenomena?). It also addresses emerging issues in the field, such as computer simulations and their role between theory and observation."
10.1093/oso/9780190878597.003.0002,Concepts of Emotions in Modern Philosophy and Psychology,"Until the late nineteenth century the classical empiricist concept of emotions dominated modern philosophy and psychology. The work of William James and Sigmund Freud rendered this concept obsolete and gave rise to the concepts that now prevail in philosophy and psychology. This essay explains the conceptual changes in the theory of emotion that James and Freud brought about and then critically examines the concepts of emotion to which their work gave rise and that now prevail in philosophy and psychology. The examination focuses on the concepts central to cognitivist theories of emotion that take emotions to be or to contain essentially judgments, cognitivist theories that take emotions to be or to contain essentially perceptions, affective theories that take emotions to be information bearing feelings, and theories that take the intentionality of emotions to have an essentially affective character."
10.1093/oso/9780190690649.003.0009,Philosophy of Logic,"Logic may be characterized as the science aiming at revealing the deep logical structure of statements and, correlatively, at evaluating the arguments involving such statements. This chapter focuses on the content of different categories of expression of ordinary language, a question that arises typically in the analysis of singular terms and propositional attitudes. It starts from the paradoxes of the “indiscernibility of identicals” and goes through two main solutions to these paradoxes: a “logic of sense and denotation” (à la Frege) and a “logic of meaning” (à la Russell). A logic halfway between the two is also discussed. In the closing section, a comparative appraisal of these solutions is proposed."
10.1093/oso/9780190690649.003.0012,Philosophy of Biology,"The aim of this chapter is to address the conceptual, theoretical, and methodological questions bearing on the foundations of today’s life sciences. It discusses the main themes of the philosophy of evolutionary biology, asking what is meant by the idea of adaptation and reviewing the various answers to the units of selection problem. The latter considers on which biological entities—genes, genomes, cells, organisms, groups, species, and so forth—natural selection operates and is a nice illustration of how philosophy of biology situates itself at the frontier between philosophy and the most theoretical parts of biology. The chapter also presents recent debates over the notions of genetic programming and organismal development and the reduction of macromolecular biology to molecular biology."
10.1093/oso/9780190690649.003.0016,Philosophy of Cognitive Science,"Cognitive science, which appears as an articulated group of research programs whose aim is to constitute a science of the mind, raises a number of issues from the point of view of philosophy of science. This chapter will sample the field by dealing with two main topics. The first one is the hypothesis of a modular architecture of the mind, which has occupied cognitive science since more than 30 years. The second part of the chapter is devoted to the foundations and limits of cognitive science, dealing notably with the functionalist framework (in particular, the computational theory of the mind) and the so-called language of thought hypothesis. We conclude by saying a few words about the division of labor among philosophers who are interested in cognition."
10.1093/oso/9780190690649.003.0014,Philosophy of Social Sciences,"This chapter addresses problems and themes in the social sciences. Social sciences are understood specifically as sciences that have (or should have) the following minimal characteristics: their object of study is human behavior and they follow a certain number of methodological principles, including a marked effort towards analytical clarity; the investigation of causal explanations through the formulation of causal laws or at least causal mechanisms; and a subscription to a form of methodological individualism, if an amended one, which puts at the heart of social science the notion of choice. We discuss three principal themes. The first raises the question of the status of laws in the social sciences and, in particular, that of “consequence laws,” otherwise known as functionalist explanations. The second theme takes up methodological individualism, as compared to holistic approaches. The last theme concerns hypotheses of rationality and self-interested motivations, which increasingly figure in social scientific explanations."
10.1093/oso/9780198783916.001.0001,The Philosophy of Charles Travis,"The work of Charles Travis belongs to the analytical tradition, yet is also radically at odds with many assumptions characteristic of the tradition. Such an approach, while being at odds with some dominant strains of thought, does speak to a strand of the analytical tradition running from Frege, through Cook Wilson, Wittgenstein, and Austin, up to aspects of contemporary thinkers as diverse as Chomsky and McDowell. This volume is the first of its kind. It collects thirteen previously unpublished papers, including one of the last papers of the late Hilary Putnam, that tackle a range of issues arising in Travis’s work, offering both critical and positive responses. The volume also includes detailed replies by Travis to each of the papers and an introductory chapter by the editors that situates Travis’s ideas in the context of contemporary philosophy of language and mind. The volume divides into three sections, relating to language, thought, and perception. Topics covered in detail include: the character of linguistic and perceptual representation; the nature and evidential role of intuitions; Gottlob Frege; Ludwig Wittgenstein; the role of context in fixing speech content; and the structure of thought."
10.1093/oso/9780198779636.003.0001,A Manifesto for a Processual Philosophy of Biology,"This chapter argues that scientific and philosophical progress in our understanding of the living world requires that we abandon a metaphysics of things in favour of one centred on processes. We identify three main empirical motivations for adopting a process ontology in biology: metabolic turnover, life cycles, and ecological interdependence. We show how taking a processual stance in the philosophy of biology enables us to ground existing critiques of essentialism, reductionism, and mechanicism, all of which have traditionally been associated with substance ontology. We illustrate the consequences of embracing an ontology of processes in biology by considering some of its implications for physiology, genetics, evolution, and medicine. And we attempt to locate the subsequent chapters of the book in relation to the position we defend."
10.1093/oso/9780198809753.003.0003,The Pursuit of Philosophy,"This chapter reflects on a long philosophical career. According to the author, what attracted him to philosophy was in part precisely the idea that it wasn’t like getting a job or following a professional career. He thought of philosophy as something you studied just for its own sake. The author also shares his life as a graduate student at Harvard University, where he was influenced by the likes of Burton Dreben and Rogers Albritton. He went to Berkeley in 1961, and cites his erstwhile colleague Thompson Clarke as the one philosopher to whom he owes the most. The author concludes by asserting that what he and his fellow philosophers have been doing is similar to the kind of investigation undertaken by greats such as Plato, Aristotle, René Descartes, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant."
10.1093/oso/9780198815037.001.0001,Locke and Cartesian Philosophy,"This book is a collection of twelve critical essays, by leading French and Anglo-American scholars on Locke’s relation to Descartes and to Cartesian Philosophers, such as Malebranche, Clauberg, Arnauld, and Nicole. The essays, preceded by a substantial introduction, cover a large variety of topics from natural philosophy (cosmology) to religion, philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and epistemology. The volume underlines Locke’s complex relationship to Descartes and Cartesianism, where stark opposition and subtle family resemblances are tightly intertwined. Since the turn of the twentieth century, the theory of knowledge has been the main locus for the comparison of the two authors. According to an influential historiographical conception, Descartes and Locke form together the spearhead in the ‘epistemological turn’ of early modern philosophy. In bringing together the contributions to this volume, the editors advocate for a shift of emphasis. A precise comparison of Locke’s and Descartes’s positions should cover not only their theory of knowledge, but also their views on natural philosophy, metaphysics, and religion. Their conflicting claims on issues such as cosmic organization, the qualities and nature of bodies, the substance of the soul, God’s government of the world, are relevant not only in their own right to take the full measure of Locke’s intricate relation to Descartes, but also as they allow a better understanding of the epistemological debate that is still running between their heirs."
10.1093/oso/9780198809753.003.0002,What is Philosophy?,"This chapter addresses the question ‘What is philosophy?’, which it suggests is absurd. It argues that it is not so much the question that is absurd as the attempt to answer it. It contends that it is much better—more reliable—to look at what a philosopher does in a particular case than to listen to what he or she says about what is being done. It also asserts that philosophy does not necessarily exist—and certainly does not thrive—in every society or culture; that religious belief or religious thought is not the same as philosophy, or philosophical thought; and that philosophy is an activity, not a set of doctrines or truths at all. The chapter concludes that ‘What is philosophy?’ is a question to be treated rather than answered."
10.1093/oso/9780198821625.003.0006,"Evil, Feminism, and a Philosophy of Transformation","Rather than offering another ‘solution’ to the problem of evil, in the form of, say, a theodicy, the discussion of this chapter is situated within an ethical framework concerned with unmasking the enactment and perpetuation of ‘structural evils’ on the political and social levels. Indebted to the insights of feminist philosophers such as Michèle Le Doeuff, but also Hannah Arendt’s analysis of evil, the novelist Muriel Spark, and Pierre Bourdieu’s work on social suffering, the chapter seeks, not to justify the ways of God, but to critique and transform unjust structures, and to pave the way for alternatives that might best support human flourishing. This necessitates attempting to identify and understand the sources of human wickedness—social and individual—while contending that, ultimately, the only appropriate response to evil and suffering is to commit to a reorientation of the self towards others and the world."
10.12978/jat.2018-6.112400120222a,Of Generic Gods and Generic Men: The Limits of Armchair Philosophy of Religion,"Thomas Crisp has attempted to revive something akin to Alvin Plantinga’s Principle of Dwindling Probabilities to argue that the historical case for the resurrection of Jesus does not make the posterior probability of the resurrection very high. I argue that Crisp’s argument fails because he is attempting to evaluate a concrete argument in an a priori manner. I show that the same moves he uses would be absurd in other contexts, as applied both to our acquaintance with human beings and to evidence for divine intervention. Crisp’s attempt to relate the evidence for a specific act of God such as the resurrection to generic theism, thereby creating skepticism about the power of the evidence, is symptomatic of a larger problem in the philosophy of religion which I dub “separationism” and which has characterized the work of both advocates of classical apologetics and philosophers of science."
10.23941/ejpe.v11i1.356, Philosophy With Feet in the Mud,"EJPE interviewed Professor Robeyns about her formative years, her scholarship on the capability approach, her ERC-funded Fair Limits project, the relevance of political philosophy for public policy, and her advice for young philosophers aspiring to an academic career."
10.4312/ah.9.1.58-75,The Gaze of the Soul and of the Angel in the Renaissance Philosophy of Marsilio Ficino,"The Renaissance rediscovered the soul as the focus of the universe. Marsilio Ficino calls the soul the “bond of the world” (copula mundi), because it connects the earth and the heaven, immanence and transcendence, time and eternity. On the other hand, the centre of the world becomes more and more relative during the Renaissance period, and individual souls live more and more in their particular times and spaces. In Renaissance paintings, a soul's point of view is determined by perspective, as developed by Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Piero della Francesca et al., and the very position of the eye also features as a “symbolic form” (Erwin Panofsky). However, above each individual and “mobile” soul there are the wings of the “motionless” angel: super animam mobilem est immobilis angelus, as Ficino says in his renaissance Christianity, in reviewing the Platonic-Gnostic myth of the omnipresent angelic gaze. In the archetype of the angel Ficino perceives a metaphor for the all-knowing Intellect, towards which the human soul ascends. Following the iconology of Ernst Gombrich, this paper also takes notice of the influence of Ficino's philosophy on Botticelli's paintings."
10.15421/40280330,PHILOSOPHY OF THE PRIMACY IN THE WORLD-PERCEPTION OF PHYSICS OF INFORMATIONAL SPACE,"Innovative approach to reveal the relationship between matter and consciousness has been proposed. It is shown that the relevance of the problem is determined today by new discoveries of the natural sciences which cannot be explained from the standpoint of the existing categorical apparatus and features of the development of modern human civilization. Individual and collective awareness of the physical picture of the world and the place of individuals in it began to significantly lag behind the achieved level of research in natural sciences. Earlier, mankind was simply interested in the laws of nature as such, but the question arises now: why are they exactly like these, and not different? Do they contain any ""intelligence""? What forces keep in equilibrium the world given to us in our sensation? The analysis of space physics in the present context is, first of all, an analysis of the primacy or secondariness of being, matter and information. According to the author's assumption, we move in time on the scale of informational exploration of the world in the opposite direction with respect to the information which becomes exhausted on the periphery of the world, but not on the scale of distances.With this view of the physics of the process, we can imagine that it is not galaxies that are moving apart, but information contained in the radiation from other galaxies has a redshift effect. The farther away a galaxy, the more exhausted is the information, the less it is and the slower time should go by. The red shift (cosmological, the Doppler effect) in the spectrum of galaxies can be a consequence of hunger for information on the horizon of the events of the development of the Universe. So, the galactlic dispersal must take place in all directions, which provides an equilibrium between space, time, mass, and information. In this, motion does not act as a form of existence of matter. The form of the existence of matter is the information about it. In this case, radiation is the energy form of information about the object of radiation. Therefore, space boundary cannot be the presence of physical objects. The boundary of space is the availability of information about space, its growth or 'burnout', which is equivalent to the dispersal of galaxies or their collapse. The information expires, the purpose of the existence of our material-spatial dimension will end. In our opinion, the paradox of our knowledge may consist in the fact that galaxies are moving away from one another on the information scale rather than on the physical one, and we perceive the real world in the form of information about it. In terms of primacy, it is our thinking and being that are secondary in relation to information which in its entirety covers and extends its influence on the entire space. If this were not the case, space would have lost its stability, becoming chaos. Consequently, it should be concluded that information is a highly organized system capable of ""self-awareness and thinking""."
10.4312/ah.12.1.189-203,What is African Philosophy?,"The article focuses on the concept of African philosophy. I enter the discussion with some of the earliest texts that we can classify both as philosophical and of African origin. I proceed with an overview of four approaches to philosophising in Africa, as identified by Henry Oruka (ethno-philosophy, philosophic sagacity, nationalist-ideological philosophy, and professional philosophy) and, in reference to other categorisations, emphasise the critique by Peter Bodunrin, who attributes the status of true philosophy exclusively to professional or academic philosophy. The explication makes it evident that the question of African Philosophy is in essence the question of Philosophy itself."
10.1590/s0104-59702001000400008,History and Philosophy of Science: a Phylogenetic approach,"In the aftermath of Thomas Kuhn's The structure of scientific revolutions, there was a great deal of discussion about the relationship between the History of Science and the Philosophy of Science. A wider issue was at stake in these discussions: 'normativism' versus 'naturalism' in Epistemology. If the History of Science, at best, gives us reliable information about what actually occurred historically, how can it inform debates about such things as confirmation or explanation in Philosophy of Science? This essay makes a case for the centrality of historical investigation in the Philosophy of Science. I will defend what I term the 'Phylogenetic' approach to the Philosophy of Science. I will argue that since the foundations and dominant methods of a particular scientific field are shaped by its history, studying that History can give us considerable insight into conceptual and methodological problems in a particular Science. The case will be made both on general, philosophical grounds, and by compelling instantiation."
10.2478/mjss-2018-0115,Orí (Head) as an Expression of Yorùbá Aesthetic Philosophy,"Abstract
Aesthetics was never a subject or a separate philosophy in the traditional philosophies of black Africa. This is however not a justification to conclude that it is nonexistent. Indeed, aesthetics is a day to day affair among Africans. There are criteria for aesthetic judgment among African societies which vary from one society to the other. The Yorùbá of Southwestern Nigeria are not different. This study sets out to examine how the Yorùbá make their aesthetic judgments and demonstrate their aesthetic philosophy in decorating their orí, which means head among the Yorùbá. The head receives special aesthetic attention because of its spiritual and biological importance. It is an expression of the practicalities of Yorùbá aesthetic values. Literature and field work has been of paramount aid to this study. The study uses photographs, works of art and visual illustrations to show the various ways the head is adorned and cared for among the Yoruba. It relied on Yoruba art and language as a tool of investigating the concept of ori and aesthetics. Yorùbá aesthetic values are practically demonstrable and deeply located in the Yorùbá societal, moral and ethical idealisms. It concludes that the spiritual importance of orí or its aesthetics has a connection which has been demonstratively established by the Yorùbá as epressed in the images and illustrations used in this paper."
10.2478/ebce-2018-0009,The ethical context of social philosophy in contemporary India,"Abstract
				Public and academic philosophical thinking in contemporary India provides evidence that philosophy and religion have never been truly separated, although there have been attempts to bring philosophy closer to science and, thus, create two autonomous systems. In light of these changes, P. V. Athavale, C. T. K. Chari, N. S. Prasad and some other authors have formed and are developing modern ethical and social theories. Moreover, feminism and gender studies have appeared in the panorama of changing philosophical and sociological thinking in India, embracing gender equality in contemporary Indian society. There has been increasing interest in sociological research and a critical interpretation of Mahatma Gandhi’s spiritual message in the cause of India’s independence, whose thoughts authors engaged in contemporary ethical problems believe to be impractical and useless today. Existentialism as a philosophical stream earned broad public acceptance and played a significant role in the history of modern philosophical thinking in India in the second half of the 20th century."
10.24908/eoe-ese-rse.v15i0.5370,Using Quentin Skinner in history and philosophy of education,"Quentin Skinner’s work is central to Intellectual History. This article reviews his methodological critiques and exegetical recommendations as they can be of interest for historians of education, educational comparatists, and analysts of educational policies. The article analyzes Skinner’s proposals against alternative methodologies. Firstly, it explores the criticisms he makes to traditional forms of the History of Ideas. These criticisms attack, in an original way, well known fallacies that are also common in History of Education. Secondly, the article explores his constructive proposals based in linguistic philosophy. The article introduces Skinner’s idea of “meaning,” which focuses on the intention of the author in issuing or writing the utterance or text. This intention can be worked out by considering the linguistic-rhetoric context of the work. The focus on intentions and contexts, which puts at the center of the exegesis what was considered a fallacy among positivist historians, implies a change in the conception of History of Education and in its relation to Philosophy of Education. The article sketches, as a way of conclusion, some implications of these constructive proposals for the work of comparatists, historians and philosophers of education.&#x0D;

10.24908/eoe-ese-rse.v14i0.5036,Cosmopolitanism as a Philosophy for Life in Our Time,"Educators the world over struggle with contemporary conditions that militate against their vocation.  Endless top-down accountability measures, rapid economic turns and inequality in supportive resources, a torrent of consumerist media stimuli that distract educational focus, and other forces require educators to work that much harder to sustain serious educational values.  In this article, I put forward a cultural and ethical vision of cosmopolitanism as an orientation that can help educators in their work.  This vision pivots around teachers and students learning to fuse reflective openness to new people, ideas, values and practices with reflective loyalty to local commitments and ways of life.  This orientation mirrors how the school can become a cosmopolitan canopy.  The school can become a place in which all participants develop ethical strength and perspective in order to respond thoughtfully and actively, rather than react passively, to today’s pressures."

Where is it going?,"This paper examines the question of philosophy of education’s direction through an examination of its historical self-understandings. The North American, and particularly, U.S. context is highlighted. The thesis is that philosophy of education must reconstruct itself through attention to its past self-understandings, but most importantly, through acceptance of projects, issues, and topics that are relevant to it, and not simply to philosophy or educational practice. Some consequences of this thesis are presented at the end of the paper.&#x0D;

In this article, the authors describe one such course which they teach to education masters’ students at Victoria University of Wellington. They argue that such courses must be concerned to address the philosophical bases of research at least as rigorously as the methods used to investigate matters of enquiry.

This is marking himas a pantheistic and monadic author. However, it is possible to find among them a large number of resemblances, not only on their metaphysic conception but also on their ethic approaches, which turn into the aesthetic ones for Nietzsche because of the art re-conceptualization done by this thinker. We might run the risk andpropose that Spinoza represents the closest precedent to Nietzsche’s thinking."
10.22329/celt.v11i0.4969,A learning philosophy assignment positively impacts student learning outcomes,"Engaging students in metacognition can improve their learning outcomes. Students’ consideration of their learning philosophy is one way for students to be metacognitive about their learning. This study analyzed the effect of a learning philosophy assignment on students’ intellectual development and mastery of first-year biology and second-year biochemistry course content. All students were invited to complete the Learning Environment Preferences (LEP) survey at the beginning and end of the term to determine if students’ cognitive complexity was impacted by the assignment. The ability to master course content was assessed by comparing students’ midterm and final exam marks. We found that the learning philosophy assignment rescued Bachelor of Science students in the first-year biology course from a decrease in cognitive complexity. Additionally, the guided metacognition rescued second-year biochemistry students from performing poorer on the final relative to the midterm exam and promoted an increase in their cognitive complexity. These results suggest that a learning philosophy assignment may be an effective way of engaging students’ in metacognition of their learning to promote their intellectual development and mastery of course material."

Even on the Continent his work has been very inadequately recognized. It is not that he has written little: he published some books and many articles during his lifetime, in German as well as in Magyar, and since his death, Barth of Leipzig has issued an edition of his selected works, including his most important contribution,Naturphilosophische Vorlesungen, also theWahrnehmungslehreandZur Weltmechanik. He has many enthusiastic admirers, and those who care to look up thePreussische Jahrbücher, March 1926, will find there a most informative and highly appreciative article on his general philosophy by Werner Deubel, who in the same journal, some two years previously (October 1924), discussed the work of a kindred spirit, Ludwig Klages. It was Deubel's article that first roused my interest in Palágyi and led me to study his more important writings."

Significantly less studied brand as a phenomenon of the art market. In this context, the goal of the research was formulated – to identify the signs of the brand, which is not just a part of the business culture, but a cultural phenomenon in general. We had to discuss a number of other aspects. First, the influence of the historical roots of culture on the formation of the brand. Secondly, the receptivity of the brand's creators to the aesthetic ideals of culture of different eras. Third, the ability to maintain ethical and high standards of culture in the development of the brand. The practical value of the research can be attributed to the possibility of applying its results in real business practice in the luxury retail management."

10.4102/ac.v18i1.585,Infusing African management philosophy into project management,"Orientation: The project management field of study is investigated in the context of the current debate on decolonisation of the university curriculum.Research purpose: Current project management theories and curriculum are based on Western management philosophy (WMP). This creates tension on the African continent where the debate is currently about the revival of African management philosophy (AMP) and how it should form part of management theories and the discourse in general.Motivation for the study: The problem currently is that AMP is not incorporated or even discussed within project management literature. The aim of this article is to create discussion around AMP and how it can be infused into project management theories and ultimately the curriculum. The AMP and WMP are discussed through the lens of project management, specifically the Project Management Body of Knowledge.Research design, approach and method: Philosophical discussion was employed to facilitate the discussion of infusing AMP into project management. Various historical concepts and practices were explored to provide perspective concerning management philosophies and theories.Main findings: Infusing AMP into the curriculum must be a conscientious effort from the academic staff who teach project management. Moreover, true infusion of AMP is best facilitated through the interaction between academics, students and stakeholders. There are, however, certain processes that are principle agnostic and are independent of either AMP or WMP.Practical/managerial implications: We should philosophise more on infusing AMP into project management, creating new theories, and that the curriculum should be adjusted to incorporate AMP.Contribution/value-add: This paper stimulates discussion around AMP and project management."

10.1093/oso/9780198733058.001.0001,The Philosophy of Social Evolution,"From microbes to humans, the natural world is full of spectacular examples of social behaviour. In the 1960s, W. D. Hamilton introduced three key innovations—now known as Hamilton’s rule, kin selection, and inclusive fitness—that changed the way we think about how social behaviour evolves, beginning a research program now known as social evolution theory. This is a book about the philosophical foundations and future prospects of that program. Part I, ‘Foundations’, provides a philosophical analysis of Hamilton’s core ideas, with some modifications along the way. We will see that Hamilton’s rule provides a compelling way of organizing our thinking about the ultimate causes of social behaviour; and we will see how, in inclusive fitness, Hamilton found a fitness concept with a special role to play in explaining cumulative adaptation. Part II, ‘Extensions’, shows how these ideas, when extended in certain ways, can help us understand cooperation in micro-organisms, cooperation among the cells of a multicellular organism, and culturally evolved cooperation in the earliest human societies. In all these cases and more, living things cooperate because they are related, where the concept of relatedness picks out relevant statistical patterns of similarity in the transmissible basis (genetic or otherwise) of social traits."
10.2478/ijas-2013-0006,Confucius: Philosophy between Philosophy,"Abstract
				 The article is devoted to the philosophy of the well-known ancient Chinese sage Confucius paying attention to the Western misunderstandings of it. The fundamental differences between Chinese and Western civilizations, the problem of transcendence, and different attitude towards history are discussed in the text. Being neither a religion nor a philosophy in the strict Western sense of the word, Confucian thinking still finds its parallels among Western philosophies. The article faces the phenomenological task to discover concrete modes of awareness, their active engagements, and their correlate contents that are sufficiently broad and founding to cut across diverse disciplinary and cultural phenomena. This brief essay is a step in that direction with explicit commitment to Confucian explication and continuity of Chinese civilization. Despite variations and different levels of interpretation, a common context between Confucius and Western philosophical trends may be found."
10.1515/dcse-2016-0015,"Philosophy of Sustainable Development, Polish Perspective","Abstract
The aim of the present paper is to awake awareness of the term “sustainable development” and show that the very term is not understood in a unilateral way. A discrepancy of perception and thus understanding of the notion of sustainability blurs its meaning. Numerous scholars and researchers use the term sustainable or sustainability to refer to the area where abilities of using methods to prevent natural resources can be demonstrated. Besides, scholars and researchers, especially in Central Europe, approach sustainability in a holistic way, paying more attention to a doer (subject) than to the doer’s vicinity full of natural resources (objects). Also school teachers in Poland, when given a task to explain the meaning of sustainable development, tend to underscore personal, social and intellectuals’ abilities and skills of people. The teachers’ observations served as catalysts to develop the presented in the paper discussion and conclusions."

10.15421/1717160,On the Possibility to Teach Doing Philosophy,"The purpose of this paper is to clarify and evaluate the possibility of teaching doing philosophy. Using analysis as a main method, I argue that philosophizing, as an activity, has different levels, some of which are connected with specifically philosophical abilities. By analyzing John Rudisill’s minimal conception of «doing philosophy», I demonstrate that many philosophical practices, such as the interpretation, analysis, and critical assessment of arguments and presuppositions, as well as the application of simple philosophical concepts, do not need a background of specifically philosophical abilities. However, other philosophical practices, including the application of sophisticated philosophical concepts and the development of novel approaches, need such a background. I show that specifically philosophical abilities are: (1) high ability of abstract thinking, (2) high motivation to achieve intellectual autonomy, and (3) capability to feel «philosophical astonishment». I also argue that there is a real possibility to teach doing philosophy, although students without specifically philosophical abilities will successfully learn only basic levels of philosophizing. Consequently, careful selection of prospective students for philosophy courses is important. Moreover, I claim that the possibility of teaching doing philosophy highly correlates with a teacher’s expertise in the pedagogical approaches and techniques of philosophy teaching. The results of my research provide to philosophy teachers information to help them choose proper methodology and raise teaching effectiveness."
10.30674/scripta.67411,The philosophy of nature as a springboard into social realism: about Ibsen's Emperor and Galilean and a post-secular interpretation of the drama by Hilda Hellwig,"Friedrich von Schelling was a significant cultural influence when Henrik Ibsen lived in Germany in the 1850s. However, because of Schelling’s Naturphilosophie, which stood out as irreconcilable with the scientific philosophy of the positivists, Schelling came to be more and more neglected after the mid-nineteenth century. His pronounced idealism, belief in God, and metaphysical comments were branded ‘old-fashioned’ soon after his death. Today, Schelling is mentioned in contexts where ideas about ‘mindfulness’ are of importance. In 1979 a clinic for Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) was founded and although originally articulated as an element of Buddhism, it is pointed out by committed practitioners that there is nothing inherently religious about mindfulness. It is however about integrating the healing aspects of Buddhist meditation practices with the concept of psychological awareness and healing. To a high degree in Western countries, psychotherapists have adapted and developed mindfulness techniques. When it comes to metaphysics, Schelling’s influence on the religious ideas that were accepted by Ibsen was never acknowledged. This text will throw some light upon Schelling as a source of inspiration for Ibsen and his milieu. Is it so, that Schelling’s ideas not until our ‘post-secular’ epoch have come into their own? Ibsen producers and actors are familiar with ‘New World Mindfulness’ and the history of mindfulness in the West."
10.30674/scripta.67146,"Psychology, philosophy, theology, epistemology: some reflections","This paper considers the implication of the researcher's own world-view for his research; the relationship between theory and empiri. General questions concerning the formation of knowledge, its epistemological propositions and social functions, so much dis-cussed in the humanities and social sciences, have had little impact upon the history of religion, where the theoretical debate seems to remain more specific, more bound to the discipline. In the polarization between ""positivists"" vindicating the notion that theories are abstracted from ""reality"" and ""relativists"" maintaining that ""reality"" is selected and formed according to theories, most historians of religion belong in practice to the first camp, and many belong so exclusively that they do not even acknowledge the problem itself. The historian of religion is not concerned with metaphysics, but with faith in its human and cultural manifestations. The researcher' own atheistic or religious commitment has no bearing on the result of the investigation, nota bene provided that he adheres to strictly empirical principles. Is this credo not only a necessary ideal, but also a true description of research? Is an uncomplicated belief in its possible realisation a strength or a hindrance in the pursuit of a relative objectivity that might be attainable outside the predictions of natural sciences? Does the historian of religion have no metaphysical involvement in the material under investigation? Is it without interest whether he is a materialist or a devout religious person, whether he is a believer or non-believer in the physical reality of the gods and spirits he describes, and in the actual efficacy of the sacrifices and other rituals in which he partakes? Statements about human and social reality are mostly true or false from a certain point of view. Objectivity in a deeper sense must be multi-dimensional and complex. Both the object beheld and the beholder must be taken into consideration. Too strong a belief in objectivity, actual or pretended, might produce subjectivity of either a naive or a hypocritical kind."

10.1017/s0362152900011351,"The Diffusion of Aristotle's Moral Philosophy in Spain, ca. 1400 — ca. 1600","Throughout much of the Middle Ages the Iberian Peninsula had been responsible for the transmision to Europe of many of Aristotle's works and those of his Arab commentators. Without the ‘school’ of translators, which flourished at Toledo for nearly a century after its foundation in the 1120s by archbishop Raimundo, the twelfth-century revival of Aristotelianism at Paris would scarcely have been possible. But the motley Christian kingdoms of the Peninsula benefited less from the tradition of Arab scholarship than did their northern neighbours. Intellectual concerns were rather narrowly limited to the requirements of the schools and interest in the moral writings of Aristotle was therefore less pronounced than it was in the sphere of natural philosophy. The evidence for Spanish scholarly initiatives in respect of Aristotle's moral philosophy before the beginning of the fifteenth century is, indeed, slender; there are some commentaries and compendia used in teaching but certainly nothing to compare with the activities of Grosseteste, Moerbeke, Burley, and Oresme."

The author of the paper investigates Martha C. Nussbaum’s philosophical concept of education in which education is considered key to all human development. In the first part, the author focuses on some of the more interesting ideas in Nussbaum’s philosophy of education regarding the growth, development and improvement of the individual, community, society, nation, country and humankind. The second part is a critical exploration of the individual in education, looking specifically at the general development of humankind and the shaping of abstract cosmopolitan world citizens, which are the main political goals of Nussbaum’s philosophy of education."

This has been so because it is not in the best interest in the teaching of an intelligent and national curriculum which forms the bedrock to the development of a truly vibrant educational system in Nigeria. This paper, therefore, is an attempt to investigate the relevance of the philosophy of education to the development of an intelligent curriculum which is imperative to the teaching of functional education in the technical, the sciences, the humanities and social sciences towards the revitalization of the Nigerian educational sector. "

10.1017/s1471068411000457,An overview of Ciao and its design philosophy,"AbstractWe provide an overall description of the Ciao multiparadigm programming system emphasizing some of the novel aspects and motivations behind its design and implementation. An important aspect of Ciao is that, in addition to supporting logic programming (and, in particular, Prolog), it provides the programmer with a large number of useful features from different programming paradigms and styles and that the use of each of these features (including those of Prolog) can be turned on and off at will for each program module. Thus, a given module may be using, e.g., higher order functions and constraints, while another module may be using assignment, predicates, Prolog meta-programming, and concurrency. Furthermore, the language is designed to be extensible in a simple and modular way. Another important aspect of Ciao is its programming environment, which provides a powerful preprocessor (with an associated assertion language) capable of statically finding non-trivial bugs, verifying that programs comply with specifications, and performing many types of optimizations (including automatic parallelization). Such optimizations produce code that is highly competitive with other dynamic languages or, with the (experimental) optimizing compiler, even that of static languages, all while retaining the flexibility and interactive development of a dynamic language. This compilation architecture supports modularity and separate compilation throughout. The environment also includes a powerful autodocumenter and a unit testing framework, both closely integrated with the assertion system. The paper provides an informal overview of the language and program development environment. It aims at illustrating the design philosophy rather than at being exhaustive, which would be impossible in a single journal paper, pointing instead to previous Ciao literature."
10.24908/pceea.v0i0.7332,LESSONS FROM ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY,"Current educational literature calls for a shift in educational paradigm from a system of facts and tests to a system of curiosity, innovation and entrepreneurialism. Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner defines intelligence for students today as “the ability to solve problems that one encounters in real life, the ability to generate new problems to solve and the ability to make something or offer a service that is valued in one’s culture” [2]. Engineers in the field are models of learners for life. They have blended content knowledge, skills and competencies into an intuitive engineering sense. Engineers work collaboratively with others knowing that the best possible solution will be a negotiation between perspectives, boundaries and possibilities. They are flexible in their approach to new tasks, they learn from failures and they welcome uncertainty. Engineers are able to assess a situation, identify a component or process that could be improved, gather data, develop ideas, and create something, an item, process or service that is valued. What might education learn from engineering?"

In thinking about the relationship between the ‘public intellectual’ and science communication, however,  philosophy has some important contributions to make, despite the differences of content and disciplinary approach. What, then, can both these professions learn from each other about how to engage with the public - and the risks that this might involve?"

10.21913/jps.v5i1.1487,"The ethics of narrative art: Philosophy in schools, compassion and learning from stories","Following neo-Aristotelians Alasdair MacIntyre and Martha Nussbaum, we claim that humans are story-telling animals who learn from the stories of diverse others. Moral agents use rational emotions, such as compassion, which is our focus here, to imaginatively reconstruct others’ thoughts, feelings and goals. In turn, this imaginative reconstruction plays a crucial role in deliberating and discerning how to act. A body of literature has developed in support of the role narrative artworks (i.e. novels and films) can play in allowing us the opportunity to engage imaginatively and sympathetically with diverse characters and scenarios in a safe protected space that is created by the fictional world. By practising what Nussbaum calls a ‘loving attitude’, her version of ethical attention, we can form virtuous habits that lead to phronesis (practical wisdom). In this paper, and taking compassion as an illustrative focus, we examine the ways that students’ moral education might usefully develop from engaging with narrative artworks through Philosophy for Children (P4C), where philosophy is a praxis, conducted in a classroom setting using a Community of Inquiry (CoI). We argue that narrative artworks provide useful stimulus material to engage students, generate student questions, and motivate philosophical dialogue and the formation of good habits, which, in turn, supports the argument for philosophy to be taught in schools."

Barad’s agential realism is presented as the cornerstone of a relationalist metaphysics, challenging the mainstream masculine metaphysics of separateness. Agential realism is also applied as a fruitful perspective for an  alternative understanding of religion, and as an important and solid theoretical perspective for the further development of feminist philosophy of religion. The latter claim is substantiated through a discussion of Pamela Sue Anderson’s and Grace Jantzen’s feminist philosophies of religion, showing how they can benefit from and find support in Barad’s ontoepistemological metaphysics."

Od svih filozofa upravo je Karl Marx najviše utjecao na sva područja ljudskog života te je svojim radom promijenio svijet. Jedan od ključnih problema njegove filozofije problem je ljudskog otuđenja. Čovjek, proizvodeći za kapitalista, udaljuje se od proizvoda svojeg rada, svoje djelatnosti, a samim time i od svoje ljudske biti. Kako je čovjek društveno biće, njegovo otuđenje od vlastite biti utječe i na otuđenje od drugih ljudi. Ekonomsko otuđenje postaje izvor svih drugih otuđenja. Rješenje problema Marx je vidio u proleterskoj revoluciji koja je kasnije dovela do novog ekonomskog i društvenog uređenja. Djelovanje Gaje Petrovića, najistaknutijeg predstavnika škole hrvatskih praxisovaca, bilo je usmjereno prema proučavanju čovjeka i društva. U tom smislu bavio se i problematikom ljudskog otuđenja. Pod pojmom ljudskog (samo)otuđenja podrazumijeva stanje u čovjeku ili u ljudskom društvu koje ne vodi napretku tog društva, nego njegovu nazadovanju. Petrović kao mogućnost ljudskog razotuđenja vidi revolucionarnu društvenu praksu u kojoj ljudi, mijenjajući društvene odnose, mijenjaju i vlastitu prirodu."

Vagueness is a linguistic phenomenon as well as a property of physical objects. Fuzzy set theory is a mathematical model of vagueness that has been used to define vague models of computation. The prominent model of vague computation is the fuzzy Turing machine. This conceptual computing device gives an idea of what computing under vagueness means, nevertheless, it is not the most natural model. Based on the properties of this and other models of vague computing, an attempt is made to formulate a basis for a philosophy of a theory of fuzzy computation."

The attitude of a person to the world is determined by symbols and meanings, in order to communicate communicatively in the world and in itself its own purpose.Values determine motivation, in particular, when it comes to corporate solidarity, when you want to do what you have to and should do only what you want. The conflict can be solved in a timely manner when public opinion goes to the quick realization of which – in particular the development of a new humanistic interpretation of the meaning of professional purpose, to which an individual is tied or touches the cadets’ respect for new forms of learning as a specific value. In education, there are several initial (basic) types of value relation of a young person to the world, because he can act as a «future» professional as a «stranger». Culture is the universal way in which a person makes the world his own, transforming it into a «House of Human (meaning) existence». Valuable professionalization, even the whole world, turns communicative ideas into the world of ideals of cultural development of being.The value of the aspect of the professional side of being always manifests the civilization level of information development of humanistic human levers, and far from always they can be expressed rationally: most axiological senses reveal the essence of conscious and unconscious depths of the human soul. But these and other aspects of professionalism can become universal, combining the sole purpose of many carriers of national cultural meanings, and, acting as the basis of their thoughts and feelings. It is such a value that forms the information field of culture in general, influencing the status of national values. Key words: Philosophy, sociocultural space, information society, system of education and upbringing."

This chapter argues that we should endorse features of the manifest image only to the extent that they are part of the scientific image. It presents a case study in epistemology, showing how these issues play out in discussion of doxastic deliberation. The manifest image of such deliberation is flatly in conflict with the best current scientific theorizing about the nature of deliberative processes. The only reasonable response to such conflict, the chapter argues, is to embrace the scientific account and reject our first-personal view of deliberation as illusory. This case study is suggestive of a broader conclusion about the relationship between the scientific and the manifest image."

This chapter first critiques recent philosophical work by two prominent experimentalists, Joshua Greene and Shaun Nichols. The chapter argues that the cases they make for this sort of strong impact of experimental work on moral philosophy suffer from a problematic form of scientism and ultimately fail. Indeed, they fail for reasons that likely apply to other projects with similar ambitions as well. Second, the chapter clarifies the dialectical situation with respect to empirically driven attempts to debunk traditional philosophical views, which leads to a general challenge to such debunking projects going forward. It ends by suggesting a more modest and plausible role for experimental work in connection with moral philosophy that gives up the overreaching debunking ambitions."

This chapter reviews the nature of Jewish philosophy as well as the tension between Judaism and Science. It positions Jewish philosophy within the broader context of Western thought, and distinguishes philosophy from the world of the Rabbis. It then provides an overview of the major themes of the work, which include issues of omniscience, providence, reason, and moral theory."

It provides a corrective to available works, and a supplement to available histories of philosophy, many of which devote little space to Jewish philosophy. The focus of this work is on the tensions between Judaism and rational thought, as reflected in particular philosophical controversies arising in the context of issues in metaphysics, rationalism, language, cosmology, science, faith and reason, and philosophical theology. Much new research has occurred in these latter areas, and so it is important to introduce readers to the rich discussions found in medieval Jewish philosophical texts. The aim of this book is twofold: to provide a broad historical survey of major figures and schools within the medieval Jewish tradition, and to focus more narrowly on the importance and challenge of rationalist discourse within this tradition."
10.1515/rem-2015-0003,A tale about Zen philosophy and a motorcycle (that is: OER & MOOC quality),"Abstract
The paper introduces the concept of education quality, mainly based on a shared culture, that is a background for a permanent reflection on a process in which teachers, students, and stakeholders are involved, in a gradual improvement of their competence. People can achieve quality if they head for an open, participatory, iterative trajectory towards personal identity construction through the achievement of satisfaction of a well done work. In this context measurement tools and final quality controls are only a means “toward the end of satisfying the peace of mind of those responsible for the work” (Pirsig, first edition 1974, 2005, p.304).
The also describes the Open Educational Resources and Massive Open Online Courses phenomenon, and presents the most recent studies about the theoretical framework and practical tools available in the scientific literature to scaffold the quality evaluation of open education. The discussion, taking full advantage of the literature presented, recognises that we are still in the infancy of the Open Education quality evaluation, and that the available tools have still to demonstrate their value in the application's fields, through empirical researches."

Modes of change are pointed to as definitive of levels of organization; these include physical, chemical, and biological modes of change. Conceptual uses of the subsumptive hierarchy format are employed throughout this paper. Developmental change in dissipative structures is examined in some detail, generating an argument for the use of final causality in studies of natural systems. Considerations of ‘internalism’ in science are presented along the way."
10.24908/eoe-ese-rse.v12i0.2364,A Source for Freire’s Philosophy of Human Nature and its Educational Implications,"A major source for Freire’s focus on culture in his codifications and, by implication, his pedagogy of the oppressed, has been neglected in the literature: Erich Kahler’s work (1943). Kahler’s definition of human beings, as beings of discernment and transcendence in contradistinction to animals, forms the backbone of Freire’s own views on human nature. In particular, Freire’s distinction of being in the world and being with the world as conditions for being a subject of education is derived from Kahler’s work. Theoretically, Freire transforms Kahler’s separation of humans from non-human animals into a dialectical unity of discernment and transcendence in which each mediates the other, and pedagogically Freire embodies such a unity in the codifications on culture. The separation of humans from non-human animals also grounds Freire’s insistence that the curriculum must be formulated on site rather than formulated a priori."
10.21913/jps.v1i1.996,Philosophy in Schools: Then and Now,"It is twelve years since the article you are about to read was published. During that time, the philosophy in schools movement has expanded and diversified in response to curriculum developments (see Cam 1993, 1997, 1998; Kennedy 2013; Sprod 2001; Wartenberg 2009, 2013; Worley 2011), teaching guides (see Cam 1994, 2006; Freakley, Burgh &amp; MacSporran 2008; Goering, Shudak &amp; Wartenberg 2013; McCall 2009; Wilks 1996), web-based resources, dissertations, empirical research (Daniel &amp; Michel 2000; Leckey 2001; Garcia-Moryon, Rebollo &amp; Colom 2005; Reznitskaya 2005; Russell 2002) and theoretical scholarship (Davey Chesters 2012; Hand &amp; Winstanley 2008; Haynes &amp; Murris 2012; Kennedy 2006; Kohan 2014a, 2014b; Lone 2012; Lone &amp; Israeloff 2012; Shapiro 2012; Sprod 2001). Philosophy and philosophy of education journals regularly publish articles and special issues on pre-college philosophy. There are more opportunities for undergraduate and graduate philosophy students to practice and research philosophy for/with children in schools. The Ontario Philosophy Teachers Association (OPTA) (founded in 1999) reports that in English-speaking Canada there are over 28,000 senior high school students studying philosophy in over 440 schools, and philosophy is now a Teachable Qualification (for an overview see Pinto, McDonough &amp; Boyd 2006). In the USA, the Philosophy Learning and Teaching Organization (PLATO) was founded in 2009 to create a network of pre-college philosophy teachers. With the loss of its founders—Matthew Lipman (1922-2010), Ann Margaret Sharp (1942-2010) and Gareth Matthews (1929-2011)—the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC) is developing a digital archive in P4C. My original article was inspired by the design (1999) and pilot (2000) of a new philosophy elective for the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE). This initiative garnered considerable interest from the P4C community because many believed that (a) the decision to offer a VCE philosophy elective reflected the effectiveness and popularity of P4C in elementary schools, and (b) the new philosophy elective would establish P4C as an essential prerequisite for the study of philosophy in senior secondary school and at university. In my view, enthusiasts overlooked an important difference in the conception of philosophy informing the new philosophy elective: it introduced students to the theoretical or academic discipline of philosophy, whereas P4C conceived of philosophy as a wisdom tradition—otherwise known as the art of living. "
10.1017/s0260210518000062,Between philosophy and social science: Harm and its object in International Relations,"AbstractAs a discipline, IR returns repeatedly to the ‘problem of harm’; debating what harm is or should mean. Exploring the discipline through this lens allows us to understand it as contributing to a broader process of negotiation centred on harm as a principle of restraint. However, existing accounts of what harm means for IR are challenged by the scale and visibility of large-scale harm. This article attempts to push beyond recent accounts of harm by Linklater and Mitchell by examining their respective framings of the relationship between harm and its explanation in IR. Building on their limitations, I propose a framework centred on arguments for ontological realism and structure as a focus for explanation. The resulting ontology sustains the concerns of both while: (a) more fully characterising the relationship between explanation and values in IR; and (b) providing a more adequate account of the role of abstraction. In developing upon existing accounts, this article seeks to provide a stronger ground for the analysis of harm in IR. More broadly, it contributes to contemporary debates centred on the relationship between ontology and values with a view to clarifying the nature of explanation in IR as a social science."
10.1515/gth-2017-0017,Hermeneutische Implikationen im sozialphilosophischen Denken von Jósef Tischner / Hermeneutical Implications in Jósef Tischner’s Social Philosophy,"Summary
				 In this article, I point out the hermeneutical implications of the Philosophy of Jósef Tischner, a modern Polish philosopher. In his early writings, the author of the Ethics of Solidarity strongly criticized the claim of the historicity of understanding as developed in Heidegger’s Being and Time and Gadamer’s Truth and Method. Later, however, he dismissed his critical attitude and recognized in both, Heidegger’s and Gadamer’s concepts, an important source of inspiration for a new formulation of the question of the other. At the same time, he tried to stay true to the tradition of the Philosophy of Dialogue (M. Buber, F. Rosenzweig, E. Levinas) as well as to the transcendental method of asking for the last “conditions of possibility” elaborated by Husserl. Thus, in his late work, he took into account some aspects of the hermeneutic concepts of the historicity of understanding and at once fundamentally transformed their meaning. In the last part of my article, I compare his concept of the hierarchy of ideas and values, which determines human relationships, with Gadamer’s notion of prejudices and tradition."
10.21476/pp.2015.1131,The ‘Philosophy of Performance’ and the Performance of Philosophy,"The notion of the 'philosophy of x', which has recently tended to become part of many subjects, from music to management, tends to obscure a range of important issues. The idea behind it seems to be that, by designating one's reflections on a subject as the ‘philosophy’ of whatever it is one is reflecting about, one achieves some kind of higher insight. Such an approach arguably grants too much to a subject whose main manifestation is actually endless disagreement on fundamental issues. In the light of this less flattering view of philosophy I want to suggest that we may sometimes achieve more by thinking of some of our practices, particularly in the aesthetic domain, as manifestations of what philosophy might become, rather than just thinking of those practices as objects of philosophical analysis."

It stresses the strong continuities in this textual tradition, which was based on the works of a small group of Greek authorities, of whom the most influential were Aristotle and Galen. At the same time, it describes differences in content and emphasis that resulted from the social orders, institutions, and faiths—Christianity, Islam, and Judaism—that shaped the viewpoints of the authors that contributed to it. The resulting narrative challenges accounts that reduce the variety and complexity of this story by invoking simplistic and misleading doctrines such as the “one-sex” body."

During the study of language as a form of the realization of VC researchers have built new and refined already known models: information, code, semiotic, performative, language and others. Thus, they completed the overall picture, but they did not explain the connection of all elements of VC as a single system, which generates an endangered result, as well as they did not take into account the entire composition of elements of VC, which includes consciousness, thinking and experience (knowledge and skills). However, the amount of accumulated scientific knowledge through the isolation and location of research does not give answers to the basic questions of philosophy of language, linguistics and psychology in understanding the connection of consciousness, thinking, experience (knowledge and skills) and language (as the second signalling system). The verbal communicative activity is polydimensional and multidimensional. It means that the presentation and study of it in a linear form is not enough. The proposed review of the models known to science and the reference to the systematic analysis of the components of the VC (linguistic (language), psychological, cognitive, intellectual, psychophysical, as well as social aspects of the personality of the communicant) provides the basis for developing a synergistic model of VC as a functional system that would show an interconnected link of the functioning of consciousness, thinking, experience (knowledge and skills) and language (second signalling system)."

Despite the centrality of language to political life and agency, limited attempts have been made thus far in contemporary political philosophy to consider this possibility. We therefore set out to explore the possible influence of linguistic relativity effects on political thinking in linguistically diverse societies. We begin by introducing the facts and fallacies of the “linguistic relativity” principle, and explore the various ways in which they “color,” often covertly, current normative debates. To illustrate this, we focus on two key Rawlsian concepts: the original position and public reason. We then move to consider the resulting epistemic challenges and opportunities facing contemporary multilingual democratic societies in an age of increased mobility, arguing for the consequent imperative of developing political metalinguistic awareness and political extelligence among political scientists, political philosophers, and political actors alike in an irreducibly complex linguistic world."

Jcup is a software library mainly focused on weather/climate models and was developed for the purpose of coupling components of various models. Jcup has flexibility in application to an unspecified number of components of earth system models. In order to achieve high order safety and versatility, we divided 5 the processes of a general coupling program into processes of changing and not changing the values of the data, and placed the former outside the program and under the control of the user. As a result, Jcup has two features: 1) that the correspondence relationship of grid indexes is used as input information, and 2) that the user can implement an arbitrary interpolation code. Jcup was applied to atmosphere–ocean coupling, IO component coupling, and seismic model–structure model coupling, and the validity and usefulness of the design were demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

10.1017/apa.2018.14,Schlick on the Source of the ‘Great Errors in Philosophy’,"AbstractMoritz Schlick's work shaped logical empiricism and thereby an important part of philosophy in the first half of the twentieth century. A continuous thread that runs through his work is a philosophical diagnosis of the ‘great errors in philosophy’: philosophers assume that there is intuitive knowledge or knowledge by acquaintance. Yet, acquaintance is not knowledge, but an evaluative attitude. In this paper I will reconstruct Schlick's arguments for this conclusion in the light of his early practical philosophy and his reading of Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Idea. Having the historical roots of Schlick's dichotomy between acquaintance (intuition) and knowledge in view will put us in a position to explore and question its presuppositions."
10.2307/628631,Aristotle as a Historian of Philosophy: Some Preliminaries,"The work of Cherniss on Aristotle's criticism of the Presocratics may be compared with that of Jaeger on the development of Aristotle's own thought as contained in hisAristotelesof 1923. Jaeger modestly described that epoch-making work as aGrundlegungor foundation for the history of the philosopher's development, and as such it has been of value not only for itself but in the stimulus it has given to further study, in the course of which the balance of its conclusions has been to some extent altered. Cherniss's own study is of the same pioneer kind, and if I confess to a feeling that it goes rather too far, the comparison with the now classic work of Jaeger will, I hope, make clear my general admiration and appreciation of the fact that it is a permanent contribution with which all future scholarship will have to reckon.I cannot at this stage even begin to discuss in detail the mass of erudition on which Cherniss's case is built up. Nevertheless, the very widespread acceptance of his strictures on Aristotle's historical sense suggest that anyone to whom they seem extreme should lose no time in giving voice to his misgivings, even in general terms, before they become irrevocably canonical. This thought has been prompted by the recent monograph of Mr. J. B. McDiarmid,Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes, at the beginning of which we read simply that ‘the question of Aristotle's bias has been dealt with exhaustively by H. Cherniss’, whose views then become, without further remark, the starting-point of the younger scholar's own inquiry into the reliability of Theophrastus. Since in what follows I may speak critically of McDiarmid on several points, let me say that his main thesis, the dependence of Theophrastus on Aristotle in much of hisφυσικων δόξαιand the consequent danger of regarding him as a separate authority for Presocratic thought, seems true enough. The derivation of Theophrastus's judgments from those of his master was already beginning to be recognised with fruitful results, and the time was ripe for a general review of the evidence."

Hume's view of skepticism depends crucially on Descartes and post-Cartesian philosophers such as Pascal, Huet, Foucher and Bayle, who reacted skeptically to major Cartesian doctrines but followed one version or other of Descartes's methodical doubt. Although all these post-Cartesian philosophers are relevant in section XII, I focus on the topics in which Descartes himself-besides his skeptical followers-seems directly relevant. After an introductory section (I) on Julia Annas' and Richard Popkin's views of Hume's relation to, respectively, ancient and modern skepticism, I turn to section XII and examine what Hume calls (II) ""consequent skepticism about the senses,"" (III) ""antecedent skepticism,"" and (IV) ""Academic skepticism."""
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195304787.001.0001,The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Neuroscience,"The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Neuroscience is a collection of interdisciplinary research spanning philosophy (of science, mind, and ethics) and current neuroscience. Containing articles written by some of the most prominent philosophers working in this area, and in some cases co-authored with neuroscientists, this volume reflects both the breadth and depth of current work in this field. Topics include the nature of explanation in neuroscience; whether and how current neuroscience is reductionistic; consequences of current research on the neurobiology of learning and memory, perception, and sensation; neuro computational modeling, and neuroanatomy; the burgeoning field of neuroethics and the neurobiology of motivation that increasingly informs it; implications from neurology and clinical neuropsychology, especially in light of some bizarre symptoms involving misrepresentations of self; the extent and consequences of multiple realization in actual neuroscience; the new field of neuro eudamonia; and the neurophilosophy of subjectivity. This volume demonstrates how current neuroscience is being brought to bear directly on philosophical issues, how some research programs are being enriched by interaction with philosophers, and how two seemingly disparate disciplines—one traditional and humanistic, the other new and scientific—are being brought together to both disciplines' mutual benefit."
10.24310/metyper.2018.v0i20.4837,Philosophy and neuroscience: relation between mirror neurons and empathy,"Ever since the discovery of mirror neurons in the ventral premotor cortex (area F5) of the macaque brain, in the late 1980s, by Rizzolatti and his University of Parma colleagues, the question was put forward whether the same type of neurons could be found in the human brain. Could it be possible that these same neurons that activate not only when the monkey reaches for or takes a bite out of some sort of food -like a nut or a raisin- but also when someone picks it up to hand it to the monkey, be found in our brains? This essay does not have the scope to consider all concepts of empathy nor to include all relevant studies on mirror neurons concerning its relation to empathy. That being so, I shall take the following path: 1) introduce mirror neurons, what they are, where they are and their implications; 2) consider some aspects of empathy from different areas of research and present Edith Stein and Theodor Lipps's ideas; 3) relate the philosophers' ideas with the discussion put forward by Iacoboni, Gallese, Rizzolatti and Ramachandran concerning mirror neurons and empathy."
10.4335/12.2.192-204(2014),Local Political Units and Sovereignty in the Perspective of Carl Schmitt’s Political Philosophy,"To Schmitt, a parliamentary system is a direct product of the liberal rule of law, which is by itself an attempt of bourgeoisie to protect itself from the state, and as such an anti-political form. As the whole liberal position of bourgeoisie, the parliamentarism is inconsistent in its position towards political matters. The second problem of parliamentarism is that it historically represents a tool of bourgeoisie to integrate in the monarchic state and achieve political unity. The historical antagonism between the bourgeoisie and proletariat does not seem to be solved even in a present day state, being it particularly true for the post-communist states, but also the rest of the world, as clearly demonstrated by the latest economic crisis. The liberal ties of parliamentarism with representative democracy based on individual secret ballot only contribute to the problem. These notions are for Schmitt closely connected to the concept of sovereignty. A sovereign is the one who decides about the state of exception within the legal order. This power is not only a legal but also a factual question. Every political subject aspiring to gain independence should note this fact in order to be able to claim the sovereign power."

The concept of diasbility has evolved to a model of integration and social inclusion, especially the social ‎inclusion of children with disability in common schools‎. The law 'On the protection from discrimination' prohibits discrimination on grounds of disability, and refusal of registration in an educational institution because of this ground. Furthermore, this law provides the obligation of statal institutions to take positive measures to make possible the enhance of education of vulnerable groups, including children with disability or special needs. These provisions would lack if not accompanied with the creation of a legal framework that explicitly provide for this inclusion philosophy and create the proper mechanisms to make it applicable. It is evident the indispensability of a multi-dimensional treatment of this problematic, that requires also the collaboration of many actors.‎ ‎The innovative stands just in the creation of mechanisms that would make possible such an inclusion. This process requires directors of educational institutions and active and teachers, devoted on the integration of children with disability in every aspect of teaching and educational process."
10.26417/ejser.v4i1.p101-105,Philosophy of Peace as a Developmental Alternative of Society,"The knowledge of history, the knowledge for the lives of people of the world and especially the knowledge of our people, the knowledge of the viewpoints of philosophers, politicians and theoreticians about peace, as a spiritual and universal value, even today remains the orientation compass towards it. On the one hand, the aspiration of these people and nations creates the existential condition for a long lasting and a permanent peace. From the other hand, the existence of wars, regional and global conflicts in different times brings in the tables of philosophers, diplomats and statesmen the need of engagement in theoretical, political, juridical and practical level. The idea that “Peace is a concept that refers to the lack of a conflict, but at the same time represents a wider concept that refers to security in social relations or economic welfare, the equality and justice in political relations of a state, in lack of war or in lack of a conflict”, witnesses the complex nature of peace. Another definition of peace even refers to keeping balances in human relations, tolerance and solving problems through dialog and deals. But above all this rationalizing and paradigms, peace is a dominating element in democracy because it is related to honor and guarantee of freedom and basic human rights. The concept of peace, couldn’t escape from different interpretations, varying on the historic-cultural level of society. That’s why the topic “Philosophy of peace – developmental alternative of society” aims to bring into light the role and the importance of peace in the development of human society."

The study aims to determine the meaning of the concept of freedom by Johann Gottlieb Fichte. His fundamental philosophical problematic characterizes as ""analysis of the notion of freedom"". The methodology of this paper supported in a systematic review of the literature, description, comparison of different concepts and philosophical notions of the nineteenth century on freedom that coming as a result of different research as writings, works and articles. The main issues of the study relates to analysis of the subject as a creative activity, report subject to freedom and concept of freedom as a self-development. Problem that appears has to do with the subject which should be a self conscious that to create his freedom. The whole philosophy of Fichte relates to three main issues: the subject, the activity and freedom. His philosophy is defined as a philosophy of practice and freedom. The basic motive of subjective idealism is search of freedom according to which freedom is a field of opportunities that are offered to us in the world. The meaning of freedom is the form of expression that will, of individual action as something natural. Freedom is not absolute and an empirical given, but it should be a creativity. Real freedom is it that rational subject creates itself."

Bary in the article “Making Sense of Teaching through Metaphors: a Review across the Studies” investigated how metaphors influence teachers approach to teaching, curriculum and their work with pupil (Mahlios, Massengill-Show, Barry 2010: 49-71). The aim of this thesis is rather different: to investigate the relation between the thought (concept) an the image described by words (metaphor). The question would be asked: is it possible such a phenomenon as the literary argument, which was formulated by Jacques Derrida in discussion with Habermas. If it is possible, next question; how it is possible? How can the consequences of this clash between metaphor and concept be reflected in the philosophy of education? Can literature as interdisciplinary subject on equal grounds be included into philosophy curriculum? Can philosophy on equal grounds be included into literature curriculum? If not - what is the reason for their separation? If on the contrary on chooses the opposite premise that they can be included - what are the philosophical suppositions for their meeting? This article tries to overview the problem from the historical perspective and to suggest the theoretical approach relying on Jacques Derrida conception."
10.4324/9780415249126-da083-1,"Imagination, in modern philosophy","In the modern philosophical period, the imagination (sometimes called the ‘fancy’) is standardly seen as a faculty for having mental images, and for making non-rational, associative transitions among such images. This standard view forms a common core of many modern philosophers’ theories of the imagination. Different philosophers elaborate upon it in different ways: for example, some add that there is a close connection between the imagination and the brain; some, that the imagination interacts with the passions in important ways; and some, that the imagination plays a crucial role in explaining how we create artworks and how we appreciate the aesthetic properties of things.
         The modern period saw several important controversies among philosophers who share the standard view of the imagination. Perhaps most importantly, Descartes, Arnauld and Nicole, Spinoza, and Leibniz argue that in addition to the faculty of the imagination, we have a faculty of pure intellect or pure understanding, while Hobbes, Gassendi, and Hume deny this. Other important controversies concern the relationship between imagination and reasoning, and the role of the imagination – if any – as a source of modal knowledge, that is, knowledge of what is possible rather than merely actual.
         Late in the eighteenth century, Reid and Kant criticized the standard view. Reid claims to disagree with his predecessors about the association of ideas and about the nature of mental images. (However, it is unclear whether he interprets his predecessors correctly; some of his objections may miss their mark.) For his part, Kant agrees with the standard view that the imagination is a faculty for having and associating mental images. But he argues that these reproductive functions of the imagination take place in the human mind thanks to different, productive functions of the imagination that earlier philosophers did not recognize. His account of these productive functions of the imagination plays a central role in his epistemology and aesthetics."
10.4324/9780415249126-h020-1,Aesthetics in Islamic philosophy,"The major Islamic philosophers produced no works dedicated to aesthetics, although their writings do address issues that contemporary philosophers might study under that heading. The nature of beauty was addressed by Islamic philosophers in the course of discussions about God and his attributes in relation to his creation, under the inspiration of Neoplatonic sources such as the pseudo-Aristotelian Theology of Aristotle, a compilation based upon the Enneads of Plotinus. Considerations of artistic beauty and creativity were also addressed in works inspired by Aristotle’s Rhetoric and Poetics, and Islamic philosophers also adapted some of Plato’s views on literature and imitation, particularly those expressed in the Republic.
         On the whole, Islamic philosophers did not view artistic and literary creativity as ends in themselves. Rather, their interest was in explaining the relations of these activities to purely intellectual ends. In the case of poetics and rhetoric in particular, the emphasis in Islamic philosophy was pragmatic and political: poetics and rhetoric were viewed as instruments for communicating the demonstrated truths of philosophy to the populace, whose intellectual abilities were presumed to be limited. The medium of such communication was usually, although not necessarily, that of religious discourse. Islamic philosophers also devoted considerable attention to explaining the psychological and cognitive foundations of aesthetic judgment and artistic production within the spectrum of human knowledge. They argued that rhetoric and poetics were in some important respects non-intellectual arts, and that poetics in particular was distinctive in so far as it addressed the imaginative faculties of its audience rather than their intellects."
10.4324/9780415249126-n085-1,Process philosophy,"In the broad sense, the term ‘process philosophy’ refers to all worldviews holding that process or becoming is more fundamental than unchanging being. For example, an anthology titled Philosophers of Process(1965) includes selections from Samuel Alexander, Henri Bergson, John Dewey, William James, Lloyd Morgan, Charles Peirce and Alfred North Whitehead, with an introduction by Charles HARTSHORNE. Some lists include Hegel and Heraclitus. The term has widely come to refer in particular, however, to the movement inaugurated by Whitehead and extended by Hartshorne. Here, process philosophy is treated in this narrower sense.
         Philosophy’s central task, process philosophers hold, is to develop a metaphysical cosmology that is self-consistent and adequate to all experienced facts. To be adequate, it cannot be based solely on the natural sciences, but must give equal weight to aesthetic, ethical and religious intuitions. Philosophy’s chief importance, in fact, derives from its integration of science and religion into a rational scheme of thought. This integration is impossible, however, unless exaggerations on both sides are overcome. On the side of science, the main exaggerations involve ‘scientific materialism’ and the ‘sensationalist’ doctrine of perception. On the side of religion, the chief exaggeration has been the idea of divine omnipotence. Process philosophy replaces these ideas with a ‘panexperientialist’ ontology, a doctrine of perception in which nonsensory ‘prehension’ is fundamental, and a doctrine of divine power as persuasive rather than coercive."
10.4324/9780415249126-n107-1,"New Zealand, philosophy in","Philosophy as an academic discipline in New Zealand came into its own during the late 1930s under the influence of J.N. Findlay and Karl Popper. Arthur Prior was the first New Zealand philosopher to gain prominence and to inaugurate original research into logic and its application to philosophy. This tradition was continued by local philosophers such as Max Cresswell and Richard Sylvan (formerly Routley) and those from overseas who found the developing analytical ethos congenial, such as George Hughes, Krister Segerberg and Pavel Tichý. New Zealand philosophy found its footing within analytic philosophy, not so much on the side of philosophy of language, but in logic used both as an analytic tool and as a subject in its own right. Philosophers also explored what would have then been regarded by many elsewhere as ‘fringe’ logics, such as modal and tense logics; these however have now become mainstream within both logic and metaphysics.
         The current philosophical scene is one that allows as much diversity as might be possible in a small country with a small number of academic philosophers. Their preoccupations are very much those that one would find in many universities elsewhere. But whereas earlier philosophical interests were based on philosophical connections with the UK, now these have become quite minor compared with the very strong connections with philosophy in Australia and the USA. Although philosophy has found a firm and energetic place in New Zealand, it remains to consider whether there is a distinctive New Zealand philosophy, and to ask what that might even be. Earlier philosophers were much more willing to take on unconventional and unfashionable points of view and turn them into viable philosophical positions; even though that is still the case, there is much more of a seamless connection with philosophy elsewhere. However, there are applications of philosophy to local matters that often have to do with relations with the indigenous Maori, the nature of the New Zealand state, which sees itself as both a bi-cultural and a multi-cultural society, the nature of New Zealand’s social and cultural identity, and local ethical issues that arise in respect to, for example, medicine, biotechnology and the environment. Most of these, of course, are concerns elsewhere also; but the local context calls for work by local philosophers in a way for which others cannot substitute."
10.4324/9780415249126-r014-1,"Social science, contemporary philosophy of","Some philosophers think that the study of social phenomena must apply methods from natural science. Researchers should discover causal regularities (whenever C operates, E occurs) and fit them into systematic theories. Some philosophers hold that social phenomena call for an entirely different approach, in which researchers seek to interpret fully the meaning of people’s actions, including their efforts to communicate and cooperate. On this view, the nearest that researchers will come to regularities will be to discover rules (whenever the situation is S, everyone must do A). The nearest that they will get to systematic theories will be systematic expositions of rules, like the rules of a kinship system.
         Besides the naturalistic school and the interpretive school, the philosophy of social science harbours a critical school. This finds researches endorsed by the other two schools shot through with bias. It inclines to agree with the interpretive school in resisting naturalistic methods. However, its charges against naturalistic researches extend to interpretations. For interpretations may give untroubled pictures of societies in deep trouble, or picture the trouble in ways that serve the interests of the people who profit from it, for example, by leaving current rules about taking workers on and laying them off unquestioned. Here the critical school may itself use naturalistic methods. If it contends that ignoring ways of reassigning authority over employment increases the chances of private enterprises’ retaining their present authority, the critical school is talking about a causal connection. There is no rule that says anyone must increase the chances.
         Yet the researches sponsored by the three schools are complementary to the degree that researches into regularities and into rules are complementary. Settled social rules have counterparts in causal regularities, which may be expressed in similar terms, although the evidence for regularities need not include intended conformity. Some regularities are not counterparts of rules, but involve rules notwithstanding. If the proportion of marriages in Arizona ending in divorce is regularly one-third, that is not (as it happens) because one-third of Arizonans who marry must divorce. Yet marriage and divorce are actions that fall under rules.
         The three schools do more than endorse studies of rules or regularities. The critical school denies that any study of social phenomena can be value-free, in particular on the point of emancipating people from the oppressions of current society. Either researchers work with the critical school to expose oppression; or they work for the oppressors. The interpretive school brings forward subjective features of human actions and experiences that overflow the study of rules. These features, too, may be reported or ascribed correctly or incorrectly; however, the truth about them may be best expressed in narrative texts more or less elaborate.
         Postmodernism has generalized these themes in a sceptical direction. Every text can be read in multiple, often conflicting, ways, so there are always multiple, often conflicting, interpretations of whatever happens. Every interpretation serves a quest for power, whether or not it neatly favours or disfavours an oppressive social class. Such contentions undermine assumptions that the three schools make about seeking truth regarding social phenomena. They do even more to undermine any assumption that the truths found will hold universally.
         The assumption about universality, however, is a legacy of the positivist view of natural science. Positivism has given way to the model-theoretic or semantic view that science proceeds by constructing models to compare with real systems. A model – in social science, a model of regularities or one of rules – that fits any real system for a time is a scientific achievement empirically vindicated. Renouncing demands for universality, the philosophy of social science can make a firm stand on issues raised by postmodernism. It can accept from postmodernists the point that scientific success happens in local contexts and only for a time; but resist any further-reaching scepticism."
10.4324/9780415249126-h013-1,Meaning in Islamic philosophy,"The discussion of the notion of meaning in Islamic philosophy is heavily influenced by theological and legal debates about the interpretation of Islam, and about who has the right to pronounce on interpretation. The introduction of Greek philosophy into the Islamic world produced a new set of authorities on how to interpret texts, and this led to arguments over the potential benefits of the new approaches as compared with the traditional Islamic sciences. The discussion came to centre on the nature of ambiguity, equivocation and analogy, with different philosophers adopting diverse theories and thus attaining a variety of conclusions about how to interpret meaning. These variations have powerful implications for the understanding of their thought. Not only do the different approaches result in different conclusions, they also represent different approaches to the whole philosophical enterprise. The topic of meaning is not so much an aspect of Islamic philosophy as an interpretation of how to do Islamic philosophy itself. The main issues focus on identifying the people best qualified to interpret texts, valid interpretations of the texts, and the notion of meaning that should be employed in our understanding of the texts."
10.4324/9780415249126-n043-1,"Poland, philosophy in","Philosophy in Poland has developed largely along the same lines as its Western European counterpart. Yet it also has many aspects which are peculiar to itself. Historically, the founding of the University of Cracow in 1364 marks the formal beginning of Polish philosophy as an academic discipline: prior to this, philosophy was taught at numerous smaller schools, and many Poles were educated abroad, which accounts for the early influence of Western scholars and literature.
         In the medieval period, philosophy in Poland followed four chronologically successive currents of thought: the via moderna, which attached itself to the nominalism of Ockham and his disciples; the via communis, which sought to find a compromise between the old ways and these new ideas; the via antiqua, which marked a return to earlier philosophical trends; and a period of early humanism. The thought of Aristotle became dominant during the fifteenth century, as was the case at practically all universities of Central and Western Europe, and although this prevailed until the eighteenth century, philosophy did not remain stagnant – variations were numerous (including Protestant Aristotelianism). The prominence of political thought in the sixteenth century reflects the fact that Poland developed a new constitutional order at this time, the ‘democracy of nobles’ (the nobility accounted for about ten per cent of the total population). Nicholas Copernicus, prominent in modern astronomy and natural science, played a fundamental role in the development of philosophy during this period.
         The eighteenth-century Polish Enlightenment was shaped mainly by the clergy and hence was initially Christian in outlook. A more radical Enlightenment programme was propagated at a later stage. The following century saw the loss of Polish independence, and Polish thinkers were more prominent in exile than in their own country. At home, this coincided with a period of Romanticism and mystical philosophy (‘Messianism’), with influences of Kant and particularly of Hegel. The end of the nineteenth century saw a variety of old and new philosophical orientations, ranging from medieval thought to positivism and Marxism, while 1895 saw the beginning of the Lwów School of philosophy which was to become prominent in the twentieth century.
         After Polish independence in 1918, logic and methodology flourished under the influence of the Lwów School. However, elements of a variety of other Western schools of thought were also present, including that of British analytical philosophy. After the Second World War, administrative strictures were imposed in order to give prominence to Marxism. A certain liberalization took place after 1956, but its effects were dampened by a highly intrusive censorship. Despite this, philosophy in Poland continued to build upon the pre-Communist trends of Thomism and phenomenology, and to incorporate the new modes of thought emerging in the West. Since 1989–90, Marxism has lost its politico-administrative supports and censorship has disappeared, so that contemporary philosophy in Poland is entering a new phase of development."
10.4324/9780415249126-a053-1,Hellenistic philosophy,"The Hellenistic schools dominated the Greco-Roman world from c.300 bc to the mid first century bc, making it an era of great philosophical brilliance. The principal doctrinal philosophies were Stoicism and Epicureanism, but this was also the age in which scepticism emerged as a philosophical movement. The central issues of debate were the nature and origin of the world, the means to attaining truth and the ethical goal."
10.4324/9780415249126-a095-1,Presocratic philosophy,"The Presocratics were the first Western philosophers. The most celebrated are Thales, Anaximander, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Zeno of Elea, Empedocles, Anaxagoras and Democritus. Active in Greece throughout the sixth and fifth centuries bc, they concentrated on cosmogony and cosmology – the tasks of explaining the world’s origin and order, without recourse to mythology."
10.4324/9780415249126-b024-1,Byzantine philosophy,"In Byzantium from the ninth century through to the fifteenth century, philosophy as a discipline remained the science of fundamental truths concerning human beings and the world. Philosophy, the ‘wisdom from without’, was invariably contrasted with the ‘philosophy from within’, namely theology. The view that philosophy is ‘the handmaiden of theology’, which the Greek Church Fathers derived from Philo and the Alexandrian school of theology, was not the dominant position in Byzantium as it was in the West; philosophy, and logic in particular, was never treated as a mere background to, or tool of, theology. By the same token, theology in Byzantium never developed into a systematic method of dialectical inquiry into Christian truths, or a science. Thus the initial distinction between philosophy and theology remained intact.
         In terms of institutional practice, theological schools and studies did not exist in Byzantium and the main purpose of higher studies was to train state functionaries. This instruction, based on philosophy and the quadrivium, was mainly private, but it received support from the emperor and the church and we do hear of occasional interference by the secular or ecclesiastical authorities, perhaps because of professional or personal rivalries among the philosophy teachers. Furthermore, Byzantium had no independent universities or centers of study instituted by monastic orders as there were in the West, where social and political conditions were different.
         Philosophy in Byzantium also steered clear of involvement in the theological controversies that arose from time to time. The prevalent model of the thinker in Byzantium was a sort of encyclopedic teacher of philosophy, an erudite scholar who kept in touch with the sciences of the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music) and other disciplines and set the philosophical tone of the scientific curricula. The development of philosophy in Byzantium was thus very different from that of Western scholasticism."
10.4324/9780415249126-da084-1,"Substance, mode, and accident in modern philosophy","The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries inherited, and were witness to, the decline of the metaphysics of substance, mode, and accident of the Aristotelian tradition. The causes of this decline can be gleaned from an investigation of various puzzles which arose during the period, and of the ways in which different philosophers reacted to these puzzles.
         One such puzzle concerns independence. A substance is meant to be something that exists independently – but what meets this standard, other than God? Another puzzle concerns identity. A substance is meant to be something which in some sense supports (etymologically, stands under) its modes or accidents – but how can we penetrate to the nature, or identity, of the substance itself? A third puzzle concerns unity. A substance is meant to be unified in a way that a heap of stones is not – but what qualifies as a genuine unity?
         The puzzles were initially raised by those, such as Descartes and Locke, who did not intend for them to radically modify our understanding of substance, mode, and accident. But radical changes followed shortly thereafter nonetheless. Spinoza maintained that God or Nature is the only substance, all other things being mere modes of God. Conway, Leibniz, and Berkeley argued that the world is fundamentally spiritual or mind-like. And eventually, Hume and Kant questioned whether the notions of substance, mode, and accident were, in some sense, unavoidably problematic.
         As an investigation of this debate reveals, theories of substance, mode, and accident were intertwined with many other enduring philosophical themes, including the nature of reality, the mind–body relation, and the limits of human knowledge."
10.4324/9780415249126-e069-1,"Medieval philosophy, Russian","The term ‘philosophy’ is itself highly problematic in the context of medieval Russia. Even in its most literal sense of love of learning, it was regarded with ambivalence, its devotees risking persecution. At the same time, Russia at any given point in the Middle Ages possessed what can best be described as a self-consciousness, a sense of its own destiny. Arising from the unusual circumstances of its Conversion in 988, this consciousness continues to draw heavily on Byzantium, with Russia at first in a dependent role but later, following Constantinople’s fall, assuming that of the proud successor. The centrality of the Christian element to medieval Russian thought is underlined by the continuing significance both of the monastic movement and of its ancient cradle, Kiev, even as Moscow was being extolled as the Third Rome."
10.4324/9780415249126-f063-1,Ontology in Indian philosophy,"All Indian philosophical traditions are deeply engaged with ontology, the study of being, since clarity about the nature of reality is at the heart of three intimately connected goals: knowledge, proper conduct and liberation from the continued suffering that is part of all human existence. The formulation of a list of ontological categories, a classification of reality by division into several fundamental objective kinds, however, is less widespread. There is little room for a doctrine of distinct, if related, ontological categories in a philosophical school that takes reality as one, even less if that one lies beyond description. If the phenomenal world is but illusory appearance, as, for example, in the Vedānta of Śaṅkara, then a determination of kinds of entities does not recommend itself as a means to adequate analysis of the world. Even the Sāṅkhya tradition’s realism reduces the world to an evolution from two fundamental entities, spirit and matter. Categories make sense within the context of a pluralistic realism, an analysis of the world that finds it to be composed of a multiplicity of real entities. Such a view is found to some extent in Jaina philosophy, but is primarily defended and developed in the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika school.
         The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika categories are seven: substance, quality, motion, universal, particular, inherence and not-being. While all are understood as real entities and objects of knowledge, substance is most fundamental as each of the others in some way depends on substance. Substances are nine: earth, water, fire, air, ether, time, space, self and mind. The first four are atomic: they may combine to form macroscopic substance, such as a clay pot, but in incomposite form they are indestructible atoms, as are the last two. Ether, time and space, likewise indestructible, are unitary and pervade all. In its irreducible parts, all substance is eternal; every composite whole is a destructible substance.
         A relation of containment, called inherence, structures the categories. The qualities, actions and universals by which we might characterize a pot inhere in it. They are distinct entities from the pot, yet cannot exist apart from their underlying substrate. Composite substances like a pot are also contained in their parts by inherence, but the smallest parts, eternal substances, exist independently as receptacles that contain nothing. A whole, greater than the sum of its parts, is said to inhere in the parts while the parts are the inherence cause of the whole.
         Eternal substance, the ultimate substrate of all, is a bare particular. An entity that is nothing but a receptacle for other entities, it furnishes criteria for separability and individuality, but cannot be defined in itself apart from others. This aspect of the concept of substance leads later Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika into extensive analysis of relations and negation."
10.4324/9780415249126-f049-1,Negative facts in classical Indian philosophy,"Like their European counterparts, the philosophers of classical India were interested in the problem of negative facts. A negative fact may be thought of, at the outset at least, as a state of affairs that corresponds to a negative statement, such as ‘Mr Smith is not in this room.’ The question that perplexed the philosophers of India was: How does someone, say Ms Jones, know that Mr Smith is not in the room? There are essentially four possible metaphysical positions to account for what it is that Ms Jones knows when, after entering a room, she comes to know that her friend is not present there. Each of the positions has been adopted and defended by certain classical Indian philosophers. On the one hand, some take the absence of the friend from the room as a brute, negative fact. Of these, some hold knowledge of this fact to be perceptual, while others hold it to be inferential. On the other hand, some hold that the absence of the friend from the room has no real ontic status at all, and believe that what there really is in the situation is just the sum of all the things present in the office. These latter philosophers hold that knowledge of one’s friend’s absence is just knowledge of what is present, though some believe the knowledge results from perception, while others believe it to result from inference. These four positions were maintained by, respectively, the Nyāya philosopher Jayanta, the Mīmāṃsā philosophers Kumārila Bhaṭṭa and Prabhākara, and the Buddhist Dharmakīrti."
10.4324/9780415249126-f070-1,"Mind, Indian philosophy of","Despite the enormous complexity of the Indian philosophical tradition, all the different schools developed within a common worldview mapped out by the three ideas of saṃsāra, karma and mokṣa (or nirvāṇa in the case of Buddhism). This soteriological context, which informs much of Indian philosophy, is of particular importance for the philosophy of mind, giving it a distinctive character unparalleled in the Western tradition. Speculations about the nature of mind originated in Upaniṣadic teachings that salvific knowledge comes from looking inwards. We see in the earlier Upaniṣads (from about the eighth to the fifth centuries bc) a careful classification of normal states of consciousness, but eventually liberation from the cycle of rebirth and suffering was framed in terms of the individual’s ability to manipulate and ultimately transcend such states through the pursuit of a set of ascetic practices known as yoga. These ascetic practices led to a liberating state of consciousness which the Upaniṣads equated with the realization of a transcendental Self known as the ātman. With the development of Buddhist thought in India (from the fifth century bc), the philosophical tradition became divided. Generally, Buddhist schools of thought were united in their opposition to the existence of the ātman, whereas the so-called orthodox Hindu schools continued to favour the Upaniṣadic position. The practical quest for liberation from suffering remained central, however, to the entire philosophical tradition as the Upaniṣads gave way to a more systematic philosophizing. Subsequently, Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike continued to accept the results of meditative practice as being a legitimate concern for philosophical speculation. A dialectical relationship between theory and practice meant that philosophical disagreements created not just differences in the interpretation of meditative experiences, but also shaped such practices themselves in different ways. The apparent empirical vein of the Upaniṣads was also continued in all schools of thought, leading to richer and more detailed phenomenological classifications of experience. This rich ontological landscape is what gives Indian philosophy of mind its distinctive character."
10.4324/9780415249126-g008-1,Mohist philosophy,"Mohist philosophy describes the broad-ranging philosophical tradition initiated by Mo Ti or Mozi (Master Mo) in the fifth century bc. Mozi was probably of quite humble origins, perhaps a member of the craft or artisan class. Early in life, he may have studied with followers of Confucius. However, he went on to become the first serious critic of Confucianism.
         Mozi’s philosophy was part of an organized utopian movement whose members engaged in direct social action. He was a charismatic leader who inspired his followers to dedicate themselves to his unique view of social justice. This required them to lead austere and demanding lives, as he called upon them to participate in such activities as the military defence of states unjustly attacked.
         Mozi is arguably the first true philosopher of China. He was the first to develop systematic analyses and criticisms of his opponents and present carefully argued positions of his own. This led him and his later followers to develop an interest in and study of the forms and methods of philosophical argumentation, which contributed significantly to the development of early Chinese philosophy.
         Mozi saw ideological differences and the factionalism they spawned as the primary source of human suffering, and he hotly criticized the familially-based ethical and political system of Confucius for its inherent partiality. In its place he advocated three basic goods: the wealth, order and the population of the state. Against the Confucians, he argued for jian’ai (impartial care). Jian’ai is often translated as ‘universal love’, but this is misleading. Mozi saw the central ethical problem as an excess of partiality, not a lack of compassion; he was interested not in cultivating emotions or attitudes, but in shaping behaviour. He showed remarkably little interest in moral psychology and embraced an extremely thin picture of human nature, which led him away from the widely observed Chinese concern with self-cultivation. His general lack of appreciation for psychological goods and the need to control desires and shape dispositions and attitudes also led him to reject the characteristic Confucian concern with culture and ritual.
         Mozi believed human beings possess an extremely plastic and malleable nature, and he advocated a strong form of voluntarism. For several different reasons, he believed that people could be induced to take up almost any form of behaviour. First, he shared a common early Chinese belief in a psychological tendency to respond in kind to the treatment one receives. He further believed that, in order to win the favour of their rulers, many people are inclined to act as their rulers desire. Those who do not respond to either of these influences can be motivated and controlled by a system of strict rewards and punishments, enforced by the state and guaranteed by the support of Heaven, ghosts and spirits. Most important of all, Mozi believed that rational arguments provide extremely strong if not compelling motivation to act: presented with a superior argument, thinking people act accordingly.
         The social and political movements of the later Mohists lasted until the beginning of the Han Dynasty (206 bc). They continued Mozi’s early interests and developed sophisticated systems of logical analysis, mathematics, optics, physics, defensive warfare technology and strategy and a formal ethic based upon calculations of benefit and harm. All the philosophical concerns of the later Mohists can be found in the early strata of the Mozi, and seem to reflect the teachings of the tradition’s founder."
10.4324/9780415249126-f083-1,"Political philosophy, Indian","While Western political theory has been framed as the struggle between the state and the individual, Indian political philosophy has been more concerned with issues of self-liberation, morality and leadership. Until recently, with the advent of institutionalized or syndicated Hinduism, Indian society made a softer distinction between state and religion. Classical Indian political theory, as with Kauṭilya, centred on axioms on how to maintain and expand power. Kauṭilya argued that reason, the edicts of the king, and his own rules of governance, the Arthaśāstra, were as important for decision-making as the ancient religious treatises, which defined social structure and one’s duty to family, caste and God. With the exception of the Arthaśāstra, politics was expressed through the ability not so much to govern as to define social and moral responsibility, what one could or could not do and who could oversee these rules.
         Like all civilizations, India had periods of rule by accumulators of capital and traders, warriors and kings, and Brahmans and monks; there were also revolts by peasants. Still, philosophy was in the hands of the Brahmans, the priestly class. This philosophy was primarily not about artha (economic gain) or kāma (pleasure), but about dharma (virtue) and mokṣa (liberation from the material world). The attainment of salvation, of release from the bonds of karma, was far more important than the relationship between the individual and the sovereign, as was the case in Western political philosophy."
10.4324/9780415249126-g014-1,Self-cultivation in Chinese philosophy,"Chinese philosophy may be viewed as disciplined reflections on the insights of self-cultivation. Etienne Balazs asserted that all Chinese philosophy is social philosophy and that, even if Chinese thinkers dwell upon metaphysical speculation, they will sooner or later return to the practical issues of the world here and now. This concern for the concreteness of the life-world gives the impression that the social dimension of the human condition features so prominently in the Chinese world of thought that the idea of the group takes precedence over conceptions of the individual self. The anthropological studies that contrast the Chinese sense of shame with the Western sense of guilt further enhance the impression that external social approval, rather than internal psychological sanction, defines the moral fabric of Chinese society. The prevalent sociological literature on the mechanism of ‘saving face’ as a key to understanding Chinese interpersonal relationships also stresses the centrality of external conditioning in Chinese ethics.
         If we follow this line of thinking, it is easy to assume that Chinese philosophers are preoccupied with neither the transcendent referent nor the inner psyche. They are not particularly interested in questions of ultimate reality such as the creator, the origin of the cosmos or the existence of God. Nor are they engrossed in problems of the mind such as consciousness, self-identity or moral choice. Indeed, Chinese philosophy as social philosophy seems exclusively immersed in issues of correct behaviour, familial harmony, political order and world peace. Even strands of thought that emphasize the aesthetic experience of the self are all intimately bound up with the highly ritualized world of human-relatedness. Actually the spirit of spontaneity, as a liberation from social constraints, should be appreciated in terms of a conscious reflection on and critique of society and thus inherently sociological.
         However, this widely held opinion of Chinese philosophy is seriously flawed. While it offers a common-sense picture of where the strength of Chinese thought lies, it does not address the underlying reasons or the actual processes that define the main trajectory of the Chinese modes of thinking. Wing-tsit Chan suggests a more comprehensive characterization of Chinese philosophy as humanism: ‘not the humanism that denies or slights a Supreme Power, but one that professes the unity of man and Heaven’ (Chan 1963: 3).
         It is crucial to note that ‘humanism’ so conceived is diametrically opposed to secular humanism as a distinctive feature of the Enlightenment mentality of the modern West. Western humanism emerged as a thorough critique of spiritualism and a radical departure from naturalism, or a sense of affinity with nature; it was the result of secularization. Chinese humanism, on the other hand, tends to incorporate the spiritual and naturalist dimensions in a comprehensive and integrated vision of the nature and function of humanity in the cosmos.
         The advantage of characterizing Chinese philosophy as humanistic rather than sociological is to open the possibility of allowing aesthetic, religious and metaphysical as well as ethical, historical and political perspectives to shape the contours of the Chinese reflective mind. This synthetic approach better captures the spirit of Chinese thought because it was historical and social change, rather than speculation, which was instrumental in the outgrowth of humanism as a defining characteristic of Chinese philosophy."
10.4324/9780415249126-g111-1,"Literature, Japanese philosophy in modern","Since the last quarter of the nineteenth century, virtually all major lines of Western thought and the works of both major and minor Western philosophers have been explored and used by Japanese writers in an effort to forge a modern Japanese literature. The history of translation alone reveals a concern to bring over synoptic summaries of Western philosophy, as well as the primary works of specific thinkers. Academic philosophy as a discipline of advanced study was established in the 1880s, the decade which corresponds to the beginnings of widespread literary reform and the often-cited creation of the first modern Japanese novel, Futabatei’s Ukigumo (Floating Cloud) in 1889.
         However, Japanese novelists, dramatists, poets and critics did not assimilate philosophical influences naïvely or passively, nor was Japanese literature made over in the shape of specific Western ideas regarding the nature and function of the self, society or literary aesthetics. Indeed, the avid translation and discussion of Western ideas frequently provoked a nativist reaction or modification. The revival of traditional tropes, the language of Confucian ethics, Buddhist practice and Shintō legends), itself often reflects the pervasive presence of Western ideas on the modern literary scene."
10.4324/9780415249126-h003-1,Neoplatonism in Islamic philosophy,"Islamic Neoplatonism developed in a milieu already saturated with the thought of Plotinus and Aristotle. The former studied in Alexandria, and the Alexandrine philosophical syllabus included such figures as Porphyry of Tyre and Proclus. Associated with these scholars were two major channels of Islamic Neoplatonism, the so-called Theology of Aristotle and the Liber de Causis (Book of Causes). Other cities beloved of the philosophers at the time of the rise of Islam in the first century AH (seventh century ad) included Gondeshapur and Harran.
         Islamic Neoplatonism stressed one aspect of the Qur’anic God, the transcendent, and ignored another, the creative. For the Neoplatonists, all things emanated from the deity. Islamic philosophers were imbued to a greater or lesser degree with either Aristotelianism or Neoplatonism or, as was often the case, with both. Al-Kindi, the father of Islamic philosophy, has a Neoplatonic aspect, but the doctrine reaches its intellectual fruition in the complex emanationist hierarchies developed by al-Farabi and Ibn Sina. Their views are later developed (or metamorphosed) by later thinkers into an emanative hierarchy of lights, as with Shihab al-Din al-Suhrawardi, or the doctrine of the Unity of Being espoused by Ibn al-‘Arabi. While al-Ghazali and Ibn Rushd both vigorously opposed Neoplatonic views, the latter attacked the former for his general opposition to the philosophers.
         Neoplatonism itself had a major impact on that sectarian grouping of Muslims known as the Isma‘ilis, and became the substratum for its theology. Historically, Neoplatonism in Islam achieved its climax with the Fatimid Isma‘ili conquest of Egypt towards the end of the fourth century AH (tenth century ad). While Neoplatonism later declined in philosophical importance in the face of rampant Aristotelianism and Hanbalism, it may be said to have bequeathed an important religious, historical and cultural legacy to the Islamic world, which in the Isma‘ili movement endures to this day."
10.4324/9780415249126-h016-1,Science in Islamic philosophy,"Islam attempts to synthesize reason and revelation, knowledge and values, in its approach to the study of nature. Knowledge acquired through rational human efforts and through the Qur’an are seen as complementary: both are ‘signs of God’ that enable humanity to study and understand nature. Between the second and eighth centuries AH (eighth and fifteenth centuries ad), when Muslim civilization was at its zenith, metaphysics, epistemology and empirical studies of nature fused to produce an explosion of ‘scientific spirit’. Scientists and scholars such as Ibn al-Haytham, al-Razi, Ibn Tufayl, Ibn Sina and al-Biruni superimposed Plato’s and Aristotle’s ideas of reason and objectivity on their own Muslim faith, thus producing a unique synthesis of religion and philosophy. They also placed great emphasis on scientific methodology, giving importance to systematic observation, experimentation and theory building.
         Initially, scientific inquiry was directed by everyday practices of Islam. For example, developments in astronomy were influenced by the fact that the times of Muslim prayer were defined astronomically and its direction was defined geographically. In the later stage, the quest for truth for its own sake became the norm, leading to numerous new discoveries and innovations. Muslim scientists did not recognize disciplinary boundaries between the ‘two cultures’ of science and humanities, and individual scholars tended as a general rule to be polymaths. Recently, Muslim scholars have started to develop a contemporary Islamic philosophy of science by combining such basic Islamic concepts as ‘ilm (knowledge), khilafa (trusteeship of nature) and istisla (public interest) in an integrated science policy framework."
10.4324/9780415249126-h056-1,Islamic philosophy: transmission into Western Europe,"The Arabs took on the mantle of late antique philosophy and passed it on to both Latin scholars and Jewish scholars in Western Europe in the Middle Ages. The debates among Islamic scholars between rationalism and fideism also provided texts and models for Christian and Jewish debates. In this assimilation of Islamic thought, several stages can be observed. First, there was an interest in Neoplatonic cosmology and psychology in the latter half of the twelfth century, which fostered the translation of texts by al-Kindi, al-Farabi, the Ikhwan al-Safa’ and, especially, Avicenna (Ibn Sina). Second, the desire to understand Aristotle’s philosophy resulted in the translation of the commentaries and epitomes of Averroes (Ibn Rushd) in the second quarter of the thirteenth century. Jewish scholars participated in both these movements, and from the second quarter of the thirteenth century they took the initiative in translating and commenting upon Arabic texts. Thus when, in the late fifteenth century, a renewed interest in the ancient texts led scholars to search out the most accurate interpretations of these texts, it was to Jewish scholars that they turned for new translations or retranslations of Avicenna and, in particular, Averroes. From the early sixteenth century, Arabic philosophical texts were again translated directly into Latin, Arabic speakers began to collaborate with Christian scholars and the foundations for the teaching of Arabic were being laid. With the establishment of Arabic chairs in European universities, the rich variety of Islamic thought began to be revealed. This process has lasted until the present day."
10.4324/9780415249126-n026-1,"Hungary, philosophy in","The situation of Hungarian philosophy can be best illustrated by two sayings: ‘there are Hungarian philosophers, but there is no Hungarian philosophy’, and ‘a certain period of Hungarian philosophy stretches from Descartes to Kant’. The two ideas are closely connected. Thus on the one hand, there is such a thing as Hungarian philosophy: there are scientific-educational institutions in philosophical life and there are philosophers working in these institutions. On the other hand, there is no such thing as Hungarian philosophy: it is a history of adoption, largely consisting of attempts to introduce and embrace the great trends of Western thought.
         After some preliminaries in the medieval and early-modern periods, Hungarian philosophy started to develop at the beginning of the nineteenth century. As a result of the reception of German idealism – the so-called Kant debate and Hegel debate – the problems of philosophy were formulated as independent problems for the first time, and a philosophical language began to evolve. After an attempt to create a ‘national philosophy’ – and after some outstanding individual achievements – the institutionalization of Hungarian philosophy accelerated at the end of the century. The early years of the twentieth century brought the first heyday of philosophy to Hungary, with the rapid reception of new idealist trends and notable original contributions. In the period between the two wars the development stopped: many philosophers were forced to emigrate, and Geistesgeschichte (the history of thought) became prevalent in philosophical life. Following the communist take-over, the institutions of ‘bourgeois’ philosophy were eliminated, and Marxism-Leninism, which legitimated political power, took a monopolistic position. During this period, the only significant works created were in the tradition of critical Marxism and philosophical opposition. The changes in 1989 regenerated the institutional system, and the articulation of international contemporary trends – analytic philosophy, hermeneutic tradition and postmodernism – came to the fore.
         Besides some works by thinkers in exile, Hungarian philosophy has produced only one achievement which can be considered significant at an international level: the oeuvre of György (Georg) Lukács."
10.4324/0123456789-da090-1,"Judgment and belief, in early modern philosophy","What is the difference between simply thinking about something and judging or believing that something is the case?
         One finds a remarkable range of answers to this question in the early modern period. A traditional approach to judgment has its origins in Aristotle and treats judgment as closely related to predication. Judging, on this view, is a matter of affirming or denying something of something else. Affirming and denying, in turn, are different forms of predication: affirming whiteness of snow results in the judgment that snow is white; denying whiteness of snow results in the judgment that snow is not white.
         Descartes rejects this approach and instead treats judgment as an act of will. He holds that the intellect or understanding presents us with a complete content for judgment, and then the will, in a separate act, assents or dissents to this content.
         Spinoza rejects both the Aristotelian and Cartesian views by holding, against the Aristotelian view, that every idea has propositional content and also, against the Cartesian view, that every idea is an affirmation. Spinoza claims that judgment or affirmation just consists in the causal influence that an idea has on us, and he holds that all ideas have some influence. Thus, Spinoza holds the radical view that all ideas are judgments.
         Finally, Hume also rejects both the Aristotelian and Cartesian views. Against the Aristotelians, he denies that what is judged or believed must always be a proposition with a subject–predicate structure. Against the Cartesians, he denies that belief is in any way subject to the will. Finally, against Spinoza he insists that there are some ideas that are merely conceived and not believed or judged. Hume holds that beliefs differ from ideas that are not believed in a way that makes beliefs more like perceptual experiences."
10.4324/0123456789-dd3598-1,Feminist philosophy,"Feminist philosophy is philosophy that is aimed at understanding and challenging the oppression of women. Feminist philosophy examines issues that are traditionally found in practical ethics and political philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology and philosophy of language. In fact, feminist concerns can appear in almost all areas of traditional philosophy. Feminist philosophy is thus not a kind of philosophy; rather, it is unified by its focus on issues of concern to feminists.
         Feminist philosophers question the structures and institutions that regulate our lives. When Mary Wollstonecraft was writing in 1792, the institutions excluded and subordinated women explicitly. Wollstonecraft, as the title of her book (A Vindication of the Rights of Woman) makes clear, was extending the enlightenment idea that men have basic human rights, to women. Wollstonecraft argued that women should not be seen as importantly different from men: there may be differences due to different upbringing, but, Wollstonecraft argues, there is no reason to think men and women differ in important ways, and women should be given the same education and opportunities as men.
         What seemed radical in 1792 may not seem radical now. Yet gender inequality persists. Thus philosophers must look beyond the formal rules and laws to the underlying structures that cause and perpetuate oppression. The feminist philosopher is always asking, ‘is there some element of this practice that depends on gender in some way?’ Feminist philosophers examine and critique the way we structure our families and reproduction, the cultural practices we engage in, such as prostitution and pornography, the way we think, and speak and value each other as knowers and thinkers.
         In order to examine these issues the feminist philosopher may need an improved conceptual toolbox: we need to understand such complex concepts as intersectionality, false consciousness, and of course, gender itself. Is gender biologically determined – is it something natural and immutable, or is it socially constructed? As Simone de Beauvoir puts it, ‘one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman’. Feminist philosophers tend to argue that gender is all (or mostly) socially constructed, that it is something we invent rather than discover. Gender is nonetheless an important part of our world, and feminist philosophy aims to understand how it works."
10.4324/9780415249126-e055-1,"Marxist philosophy, Russian and Soviet","The history of Russian Marxism involves a dramatic interplay of philosophy and politics. Though Marx’s ideas were taken up selectively by Russian populists in the 1870s, the first thoroughgoing Russian Marxist was G.V. Plekhanov, whose vision of philosophy became the orthodoxy among Russian communists. Inspired by Engels, Plekhanov argued that Marxist philosophy is a form of ‘dialectical materialism’ (Plekhanov’s coinage). Following Hegel, Marxism focuses on phenomena in their interaction and development, which it explains by appeal to dialectical principles (for instance, the law of the transformation of quantity into quality). Unlike Hegel’s idealism, however, Marxism explains all phenomena in material terms (for Marxists, the ’material’ includes economic forces and relations). Dialectical materialism was argued to be the basis of Marx’s vision of history according to which historical development is the outcome of changes in the force of production.
         In 1903, Plekhanov’s orthodoxy was challenged by a significant revisionist school: Russian empiriocriticism. Inspired by Mach’s positivism, A.A. Bogdanov and others argued that reality is socially organized experience, a view they took to suit Marx’s insistence that objects be understood in their relation to human activity. Empiriocriticism was associated with the Bolsheviks until 1909, when Lenin moved to condemn Bogdanov’s position as a species of idealism repugnant to both Marxism and common sense. Lenin endorsed dialectical materialism, which thereafter was deemed the philosophical worldview of the Bolsheviks.
         After the Revolution of 1917, Soviet philosophers were soon divided in a bitter controversy between ‘mechanists’ and ‘dialecticians’. The former argued that philosophy must be subordinate to science. In contrast, the Hegelian ‘dialecticians’, led by A.M. Deborin, insisted that philosophy is needed to explain the very possibility of scientific knowledge. The debate was soon deadlocked, and in 1929 the dialecticians used their institutional might to condemn mechanism as a heresy. The following year, the dialecticians were themselves routed by a group of young activists sponsored by Communist Party. Denouncing Deborin and his followers as ‘Menshevizing idealists’, they proclaimed that Marxist philosophy had now entered its ‘Leninist stage’ and invoked Lenin’s idea of the partiinost’ (‘partyness’) of philosophy to license the criticism of theories on entirely political grounds. Philosophy became a weapon in the class war.
         In 1938, Marxist-Leninist philosophy was simplistically codified in the fourth chapter of the Istoriia kommunisticheskoi partii sovetskogo soiuza (Bol’sheviki). Kraatkii kurs (History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). Short Course). The chapter, apparently written by Stalin himself, was declared the height of wisdom, and Soviet philosophers dared not transcend its limited horizons. The ‘new philosophical leadership’ devoted itself to glorifying the Party and its General Secretary. The ideological climate grew even worse in the post-war years when A.A. Zhdanov’s campaign against ‘cosmopolitanism’ created a wave of Russian chauvinism in which scholars sympathetic to Western thought were persecuted. The Party also meddled in scientific, sponsoring T.D. Lysenko’s bogus genetics, while encouraging criticism of quantum mechanics, relativity theory and cybernetics as inconsistent with dialectical materialism.
         The Khrushchev ‘thaw’ brought a renaissance in Soviet Marxism, when a new generation of young philosophers began a critical re-reading of Marx’s texts. Marx’s so-called ‘method of ascent from the abstract to the concrete’ was developed, by E.V. Il’enkov and others, into an anti-empiricist epistemology. There were also important studies of consciousness and ’the ideal’ by Il’enkov and M.K. Mamardashvili, the former propounding a vision of the social origins of the mind that recalls the cultural-historical psychology developed by L.S. Vygotskii in the 1930s.
         However, the thaw was short-lived. The philosophical establishment, still populated by the Stalinist old guard, continued to exercise a stifling influence. Although the late 1960s and 1970s saw heartfelt debates in many areas, particularly about the biological basis of the mind and the nature of value (moral philosophy had been hitherto neglected), the energy of the early 1960s was lacking. Marxism-Leninism still dictated the terms of debate and knowledge of Western philosophers remained relatively limited.
         In the mid-1980s, Gorbachev’s reforms initiated significant changes. Marxism-Leninism was no longer a required subject in all institutions of higher education; indeed, the term was soon dropped altogether. Discussions of democracy and the rule of law were conducted in the journals, and writings by Western and Russian émigré philosophers were published. Influential philosophers such as I.T. Frolov, then editor of Pravda, called for a renewal of humanistic Marxism. The reforms, however, came too late. The numerous discussions of the fate of Marxism at this time reveal an intellectual culture in crisis. While many maintained that Marx’s theories were not responsible for the failings of the USSR, others declared the bankruptcy of Marxist ideas and called for an end to the Russian Marxist tradition. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it seems their wish has been fulfilled."
10.4324/9780415249126-g003-1,"Confucian philosophy, Chinese","Chinese Confucian philosophy is primarily a set of ethical ideas oriented toward practice. Characteristically, it stresses the traditional boundaries of ethical responsibility and dao, or the ideal of the good human life as a whole. It may be characterized as an ethics of virtue in the light of its conception of dao and de (virtue). Comprising the conceptual framework of Confucian ethics are notions of basic virtues such as ren (benevolence), yi (rightness, righteousness), and li (rites, propriety). There are also notions of dependent virtues such as filiality, loyalty, respectfulness and integrity. Basic virtues are considered fundamental, leading or action-guiding, cardinal and the most comprehensive. In the classic Confucian sense, ren pertains to affectionate concern for the well-being of fellows in one’s community. Notably, ren is often used in an extended sense by major Song and Ming Confucians as interchangeable with dao for the ideal of the universe as a moral community. Yi pertains to the sense of rightness, especially exercised in coping with changing circumstances of human life, those situations that fall outside the scope of li. Li focuses on rules of proper conduct, which have three functions: delimiting, supportive and ennobling. That is, the li define the boundaries of proper behaviour, provide opportunities for satisfying desires of moral agents within these boundaries, and encourage the development of noble characters which markedly embody cultural refinement and communal concerns. The li are the depository of insights of the Confucian tradition as a living ethical tradition. This tradition is subject to changing interpretation governed by the exercise of quan or the weighing of circumstances informed by the sense of rightness (yi).
         However, the common Confucian appeal to historical events and paradigmatic individuals is criticized because of lack of understanding of the ethical uses of such a historical appeal. The pedagogical use stresses the study of the classics in terms of the standards of ren, yi and li. Learning, however, is not a mere acquisition of knowledge, but requires understanding and insight. Also, the companion study of paradigmatic individuals is important, not only because they point to models of emulation but also because they are, so to speak, exemplary personifications of the spirits of ren, yi and li. Moreover, they also function as reminders of moral learning and conduct that appeal especially to what is deemed in the real interest of the learner. The rhetorical use of the historical appeal is basically an appeal to plausible presumptions, or shared beliefs and trustworthiness. These presumptions are subject to further challenge, but they can be accepted as starting points in discourse. The elucidative use of historical appeal purports to clarify the relevance of the past for the present. Perhaps most important for argumentative discourse is the evaluative function of historical appeal. It focuses our knowledge and understanding of our present problematic situations as a basis for exerting the unexamined claims based on the past as a guidance for the present. Thus, both the elucidative and evaluative uses of historical appeal are critical and attentive to evidential grounding of ethical claims.
         Because of its primary ethical orientation and its influence on traditional Chinese life and thought, Confucianism occupies a pre-eminent place in the history of Chinese philosophy. The core of Confucian thought lies in the teachings of Confucius (551–479 bc) contained in the Analects (Lunyu), along with the brilliant and divergent contributions of Mencius (372?–289 bc) and Xunzi (fl. 298–238 bc), as well as the Daxue (Great Learning) and the Zhongyong (Doctrine of the Mean), originally chapters in the Liji (Book of Rites). Significant and original developments, particularly along a quasi-metaphysical route, are to be found in the works of Zhou Dunyi (1017–73), Zhang Zai (1020–77), Cheng Hao (1032–85), Cheng Yi (1033–1107), Zhu Xi (1130–1200), Lu Xiangshan (1139–93), and Wang Yangming (1472–1529). Li Gou (1009–59), Wang Fuzhi (1619–92), and Dai Zhen (1723–77) have also made noteworthy contributions to the critical development of Confucian philosophy. In the twentieth century, the revitalization and transformation of Confucian philosophy has taken a new turn in response to Western philosophical traditions. Important advances have been made by Feng Youlan, Tang Junyi, Thomé H. Fang, and Mou Zongsan. Most of the recent works in critical reconstruction are marked by a self-conscious concern with analytic methodology and the relevance of existentialism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics. Still lacking is a comprehensive and systematic Confucian theory informed by both the history and the problems of Western philosophy."
10.4324/9780415249126-g202-1,"Confucian philosophy, Korean","Confucianism came to Korea in the late fourth century ad. While Buddhism, which had arrived at the same time, was for centuries the central spiritual and intellectual tradition of Korea, Confucianism was viewed as largely limited to the world of government functionaries. In China during the Song dynasty (979–1279) a creative Confucian movement revitalized and reshaped the tradition, giving rise to what Western Scholars call ‘neo-Confucianism’. By the end of the fourteenth century neo-Confucian learning had penetrated deeply among young scholar-officials in Korea, who used it as a lever against the deeply entrenched Buddhist establishment. In 1392, in history’s only neo-Confucian revolution, a new dynasty was founded in Korea. The Chosôn dynasty (1392–1910), ruling a country smaller in scale and more centrally unified than China, was to make Korea the most (neo-) Confucian of all East Asian societies.
         The scale, control, and temper of Korean society had important consequences for the development of the neo-Confucian tradition. In China the Cheng–Zhu school of neo-Confucian thought held privileged status as the orthodox standard for the all-important civil service examinations. Zhu Xi (1130–1200) was the great creative synthesizer of this school and its foremost authority, but his synthesis drew especially upon the work of the Cheng brothers. The Cheng–Zhu school was rivalled and even eclipsed in popularity later by the school of Wang Yangming (1472–1529), whose more Zen-like approach also found great favour in Japan. Korea, in contrast to both China and Japan, remained almost exclusively devoted to the Cheng–Zhu school.
         This exclusive and intensive development of the Cheng–Zhu school of neo-Confucian thought is the most generally distinctive characteristic of Korean neo-Confucianism. When the thinkers of a culture devote themselves for centuries to a single complex body of learning, as was the case for example with Aristotle and medieval Europe, the result is a mode of philosophical discourse described as ‘scholasticism’. Scholastic philosophy is renowned for the intricacy and closeness of its argumentation, though this may be an obstacle for the outsider for whom it is often difficult to recapture the intense and absorbing vision which inspired major controversy about seemingly minor differences. Korea, with its exclusive cultivation of Zhu Xi’s complex synthesis, produced the most scholastic version of neo-Confucian thought. The writings of scholars or scholar-officials of note were commonly collected and published after their death, so the centuries of ‘collected works’, written in literary Chinese, are a vast resource in which the twists and turns, the problems and potentials for development in the Cheng–Zhu school are examined with unequalled thoroughness.
         To understand the particular contribution this Korean scholasticism made to neo-Confucian thought one must be aware of the scope and complexity of Zhu Xi’s synthesis. The intellectual culture within which the Confucian revivalists of the Song dynasty worked had for seven or eight centuries been predominantly shaped by Daoist and Buddhist influences, so the questions in their minds as they returned to the Confucian classics included dimensions neglected by more traditional Confucianism. Read with new eyes, an entirely new level of meaning was uncovered in the ancient texts: they discovered a Confucian foundation for the meditative cultivation of consciousness that had been a particular strength of the Buddhists, and to frame it and provide an account of sagehood equal to Buddhist talk of enlightenment, they found a complete metaphysical system, a Confucian version of the kind of thinking that had been elaborated mainly under Daoist auspices. Thus Zhu Xi’s synthesis knit together not just disparate thinkers of the Song dynasty, but contemporary questions with texts well over a thousand years old. It incorporated Daoist metaphysics with Buddhist meditative cultivation in a new structure with Confucian moral values and social concerns at that structure’s core. Implicit in this was the conflation of the distinctive world views of India, the origin of Buddhism, and China. This has important metaphysical consequences, for the central paradigm for Indian reflection on the nature of existence was consciousness, while for the Chinese it was the image of a single living physical body.
         A synthesis of this scope cannot be a seamless whole, though the conceptual system with which Zhu Xi knit it together achieved a remarkable degree of verbal consistency. This, in fact, is where Korean neo-Confucian thought makes a special contribution. For it is at the seams, where differences and tensions inherent in a synthesis are conceptually masked, that the kind of problems occur that become the source of endless scholastic controversy. Korean neo-Confucianism contains two such controversies; each has occupied minds for centuries. Though the points being debated resist any ultimate solution, the disputes themselves disclose the creative tensions at the heart of Zhu Xi’s synthesis.
         The first of these controversies arose in the middle of the sixteenth century and decisively shaped the intellectual agenda for the remainder of the Chosôn dynasty. The protagonists in the controversy, Yi Hwang and Yi I, are the two most famous names in Korean thought, and allegiance to each became the central dividing line of Korean neo-Confucianism. Known as the ‘Four–Seven Debate,’ this controversy is the most famous philosophical dispute in Korean history. On the surface it involves the question of feelings and how they arise. Some feelings, such as commiseration or shame at doing evil, seem spontaneously human and correct, while others, such as fear, anger, or pleasure, seem more questionable. Are there then two kinds of feelings that arise from different sources? The question is of great philosophical importance, because ultimately it discloses tensions at the heart of the dualistic monism/monistic dualism which is the fundamental structure of Zhu Xi’s metaphysical system.
         The second great controversy arose among followers of Yi I in the early eighteenth century. Neo-Confucian metaphysics views the entire universe as possessing a single nature, which is manifested differently at different levels of existence due to the differing capacities of the concrete, psychophysical component of various sorts of creatures. The Horak controversy swirled about the question of whether the fundamental or ‘original’ nature of things is the same or different. The fundamental nature is normative, and it would be absurd to say the norm for a cow is the same as for a human; but the fundamental nature is fundamental and normative precisely because it is considered as anterior to the limitation/distortion of the imperfect psychophysical component. How then can it be considered as differentiated into cow and human? Pulling at these seemingly verbal loose ends leads again deep into Zhu Xi’s metaphysics, revealing between its Indian and Chinese (Buddhist and Daoist) motifs tensions which come to a focus more clearly here perhaps than anywhere else in neo-Confucian thought."
10.4324/9780415249126-h004-1,Mystical philosophy in Islam,"Mystical philosophy has an intimate connection with the mainstream of Islamic philosophy. It consists of several main strands, ranging from Isma‘ili thought to the metaphysics of al-Ghazali and Ibn al-‘Arabi, and with a continuing powerful presence in the contemporary Islamic world. Although mystical thinkers were aware that they were advocating an approach to thinking and knowledge which differed from much of the Peripatetic tradition, they constructed a systematic approach which was often continuous with that tradition. On the whole they emphasized the role of intellectual intuition in our approach to understanding reality, and sought to show how such an understanding might be put on a solid conceptual basis. The ideas that they created were designed to throw light on the nature of the inner sense of Islam."
10.4324/9780415249126-h010-1,Soul in Islamic philosophy,"The discussion of the human soul, its existence, nature, ultimate objective and eternity, occupies a highly important position in Islamic philosophy and forms its main focus. For the most part Muslim philosophers agreed, as did their Greek predecessors, that the soul consists of non-rational and rational parts. The non-rational part they divided into the plant and animal souls, the rational part into the practical and the theoretical intellects. All believed that the non-rational part is linked essentially to the body, but some considered the rational part as separate from the body by nature and others that all the parts of the soul are by nature material. The philosophers agreed that, while the soul is in the body, its non-rational part is to manage the body, its practical intellect is to manage worldly affairs, including those of the body, and its theoretical intellect is to know the eternal aspects of the universe. They thought that the ultimate end or happiness of the soul depends on its ability to separate itself from the demands of the body and to focus on grasping the eternal aspects of the universe. All believed that the non-rational soul comes into being and unavoidably perishes. Some, like al-Farabi, believed that the rational soul may or may not survive eternally; others, like Ibn Sina, believed that it has no beginning and no end; still others, such as Ibn Rushd, believed that the soul with all its individual parts comes into existence and is eventually destroyed."
10.4324/9780415249126-s068-1,"Work, philosophy of","Unlike play, work is activity that has to involve significant expenditure of effort and be directed toward some goal beyond enjoyment. The term ‘work’ is also used to signify an individual’s occupation, the means whereby they gain their livelihood. In modern market economies individuals contract to work for other individuals on specified terms. Beyond noting this formal freedom to choose how one shall work, critics of market economies have maintained that one’s occupation should be a realm of substantive freedom, in which work is freely chosen self-expression. Against this unalienated labour norm, others have held that the freedom of self-expression is one good among others that work can provide, such as lucrative pay, friendly social contact and the satisfaction of the self-support norm, and that none of these various work-related goods necessarily should have priority over others. Some philosophers place responsibility on society for providing opportunities for good work for all members of society; others hold that the responsibility for the quality of one’s occupational life appropriately falls on each individual alone. Finally, some theorists of work emphasize that performance of hard work renders one deserving of property ownership (John Locke) or enhances one’s spiritual development (Mahatma Gandhi)."
10.4324/9780415249126-h017-1,Logic in Islamic philosophy,"Islamic logic was inspired primarily by Aristotle’s logical corpus, the Organon (which according to a late Greek taxonomy also included the Rhetoric and Poetics). Islamic authors were also familiar with some elements in Stoic logic and linguistic theory, and their logical sources included not only Aristotle’s own works but also the works of the late Greek Aristotelian commentators, the Isagōgēof Porphyry and the logical writings of Galen. However, most of the logical work of the Islamic philosophers remained squarely within the tradition of Aristotelian logic, and most of their writings in this area were in the form of commentaries on Aristotle.
         For the Islamic philosophers, logic included not only the study of formal patterns of inference and their validity but also elements of the philosophy of language and even of epistemology and metaphysics. Because of territorial disputes with the Arabic grammarians, Islamic philosophers were very interested in working out the relationship between logic and language, and they devoted much discussion to the question of the subject matter and aims of logic in relation to reasoning and speech. In the area of formal logical analysis, they elaborated upon the theory of terms, propositions and syllogisms as formulated in Aristotle’s Categories, De interpretatione and Prior Analytics. In the spirit of Aristotle, they considered the syllogism to be the form to which all rational argumentation could be reduced, and they regarded syllogistic theory as the focal point of logic. Even poetics was considered as a syllogistic art in some fashion by most of the major Islamic Aristotelians.
         Since logic was viewed as an organon or instrument by which to acquire knowledge, logic in the Islamic world also incorporated a general theory of argumentation focused upon epistemological aims. This element of Islamic logic centred upon the theory of demonstration found in Aristotle’s Posterior Analytics, since demonstration was considered the ultimate goal sought by logic. Other elements of the theory of argumentation, such as dialectics and rhetoric, were viewed as secondary to demonstration, since it was held that these argument forms produced cognitive states inferior in certitude and stability to demonstration. The philosopher’s aim was ultimately to demonstrate necessary and certain truth; the use of dialectical and rhetorical arguments was accounted for as preparatory to demonstration, as defensive of its conclusions, or as aimed at communicating its results to a broader audience."
10.4324/9780415249126-q038-1,French philosophy of science,"A distinctively French tradition in the philosophy of science began with Descartes, continued through the Enlightenment in works such as D’Alembert’s Discours préliminaire and the Encyclopédie, and flowered in the ninteenth and the early twentieth century with the work of Comte, Duhem, Meyerson and Poincaré. Throughout the twentieth century, the dominant fashions in French philosophy derived more and more from German influences, especially idealism and phenomenology (Hegel to Heidegger). But amidst these developments, there persisted an essentially autonomous tradition of French philosophy of science that offered an indigenous alternative to the Germanic imports. Here the key figure was Gaston Bachelard (1884–1962), for many years professor at the Sorbonne and director of the Institut d’Histoire des Sciences et des Techniques. His work was continued and modified by Georges Canguilhem (1904–95), his successor at the Institute, who himself was an important influence on philosophers such as Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault and Michel Serres. Jean Cavaillès’ critique of Husserl’s philosophy of mathematics and his effort to develop a neo-Hegelian alternative to it had deep affinities with Bachelard’s work and was also an important influence on Canguilhem.
         The most important general features of twentieth-century French philosophy of science appear if we contrast it with its two major rivals: existential phenomenology and logical positivism. Existential phenomenology is a ‘philosophy of the subject’, maintaining that ultimate truth resides in the immediacy of lived experience. Bachelard and his followers, by contrast, proposed a ‘philosophy of the concept’, for which experiential immediacy is subordinate to and corrected by concepts produced by rational reflection. This process of rational reflection is, moreover, embodied in science, which is not, as existential phenomenology maintains, a derivative and incomplete form of knowing, but the very paradigm of knowledge. In giving science a privileged epistemic position, the French philosophers of science are like the logical positivists. But, unlike the positivists, they treat science as essentially historical, irreducible in either method or content to the rigour of a formal system. They also opposed the positivists’ effort to find the foundations of scientific knowledge in sense experience, maintaining that there are no simply given data and that all experience is informed by conceptual interpretation."
10.4324/9780415249126-q074-1,Naturalized philosophy of science,"Naturalized philosophy of science is part of a general programme of naturalism in philosophy. Naturalists reject all forms of supernaturalism, holding that reality, including human life and culture, is exhausted by what exists in the causal order of nature. Naturalists also reject any claims to a priori knowledge, including that of principles of inference, holding instead that all knowledge derives from human interactions with the natural world. Philosophically, naturalists identify most closely with empiricism or pragmatism. David Hume was a naturalist. So was John Dewey. The logical empiricists were naturalists regarding fundamental ontological categories such as space, time and causality, but non-naturalists about scientific inference, which they came to regard as a branch of logic. Most naturalists now dismiss searches for ’philosophical foundations’ of the special sciences, treating the basic principles of any science as part of scientific theory itself.
         The main objection to naturalism has been at the level of general methodological principles, particularly those regarding scientific inference. Here non-naturalists object that, being limited to ’describing’ how science is in fact practised, naturalists cannot provide norms for legitimate scientific inferences. And providing such norms is held to be one of the main goals of the philosophy of science. Naturalists reply that the only norms required for science are those connecting specific means with the assumed goals of research. These connections can be established only through further scientific research. And the choice of goals is, for naturalists, not a scientific question but a matter of practical choice guided by an empirical understanding of what can in fact be achieved.
         Among naturalists, the main differences concern the relative importance of various aspects of the practice of science. These aspects exist at different levels: neurological, biological, psychological, personal, computational, methodological, social and cultural. Each of these levels has its champions among contemporary naturalists, some insisting that everything ultimately be reduced to their favourite level. Perhaps the wisest approach is to allow that influences at all levels are operative in any scientific context, while admitting that some influences may be more important than others in particular cases, depending on what one seeks to understand. There may be no simple, one-level, naturalistic theory of science."
10.4324/9780415249126-f002-1,Hindu philosophy,"Hindu philosophy is the longest surviving philosophical tradition in India. We can recognize several historical stages. The earliest, from around 700 bc, was the proto-philosophical period, when karma and liberation theories arose, and the proto-scientific ontological lists in the Upaniṣads were compiled. Next came the classical period, spanning the first millennium ad, in which there was constant philosophical exchange between different Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina schools. During this period, some schools, such as Sāṅkhya, Yoga and Vaiśeṣika, fell into oblivion and others, such as Kashmir Saivism, emerged. Finally, after the classical period only two or three schools remained active. The political and economic disturbances caused by repeated Muslim invasions hampered intellectual growth. The schools that survived were the Logic school (Nyāya), especially New Logic (Navya-Nyāya), the grammarians and, above all, the Vedānta schools.
         The central concerns of the Hindu philosophers were metaphysics, epistemological issues, philosophy of language, and moral philosophy. The different schools can be distinguished by their different approaches to reality, but all considered the Vedas (the sacred scriptures) authoritative, and all believed that there is a permanent individual self (ātman). They shared with their opponents (Buddhists and Jainas) a belief in the need for liberation. They used similar epistemic tools and methods of argument.
         In contrast to their opponents, who were atheists, Hindu philosophers could be either theists or atheists. Actually we can observe an increased tendency towards theistic ideas near the end of the classical period, with the result that the strictly atheistic teachings, which were more philosophically rigorous and sound, fell into disuse. Hindu metaphysics saw ātman as part of a larger reality (Brahman).
         Because these views of the world differed, they had to be proved and properly established. Accordingly, logical and epistemological tools were developed and fashioned according to the needs and beliefs of individual philosophers. Most agreed on two or three sources of knowledge: perception and inference, with verbal testimony as a possible third. In this quest for philosophical rigour, there was a need for precision of language, and there were important philosophical developments among the grammarians and the philosophers who explained the Vedas (the Mīmāṃsakas). A culmination of these linguistic efforts can be seen in the philosopher of language Bhartṛhari. One of his greatest accomplishments was the full articulation of the theory that a sentence as a whole is understood in a sudden act of comprehension.
         It is customary to name six Hindu schools, of the more than a dozen that existed, thus lumping several into a single school. This is particularly the case with Vedānta. The six are listed in three pairs: Sāṅkhya–Yoga; Vedānta–Mīmāṃsā; Nyāya–Vaiśeṣika. This does not take account of the grammarians or Kashmir Saivism.
         In their quest for freedom from rebirth, all the Hindu schools operated within the same framework. Their ultimate goal was liberation. How much they were truly engaged in the quest for liberation apart from their philosophical preoccupations is not always clear, yet they never doubted its real possibility."
10.4324/9780415249126-g100-1,Japanese philosophy,"The most distinctive characteristic of Japanese philosophy is how it has assimilated and adapted foreign philosophies to its native worldview. As an isolated island nation, Japan successfully resisted foreign invasion until 1945 and, although it borrowed ideas freely throughout its history, was able to do so without the imposition of a foreign military or colonial presence. Japanese philosophy thus bears the imprint of a variety of foreign traditions, but there is always a distinctively Japanese cultural context. In order to understand the dynamics of Japanese thought, therefore, it is necessary to examine both the influence of various foreign philosophies through Japanese history and the underlying or continuing cultural orientation that set the stage for which ideas would be assimilated and in what way.
         The major philosophical traditions to influence Japan from abroad have been Confucianism, Buddhism, neo-Confucianism and Western philosophy. Daoism also had an impact, but more in the areas of alchemy, prognostication and folk medicine than in philosophy. Although these traditions often overlapped, each also had distinctive influences.
         In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian thought entered Japan around the fifth century ad. Through the centuries the imprint of Confucianism has been most noticeable in the areas of social structure, government organization and ethics. Philosophically speaking, the social self in Japan has its roots mainly in Confucian ideals, blended since the sixteenth century with certain indigenous ideas of loyalty and honour developed within the Japanese samurai or warrior class.
         The philosophical impact of Buddhism, introduced around the same time as Confucianism, has been primarily in three areas: psychology, metaphysics and aesthetics. With its emphasis on disciplined contemplation and introspective analysis, Buddhism has helped define the various Japanese senses of the inner, rather than social, self. In metaphysics, Buddhist esotericism has been most dominant; through esoteric Buddhist philosophy, the Japanese gave a rational structure to their indigenous beliefs that spirituality is immanent rather than transcendent, that mind and body (like humanity and nature) are continuous rather than separate, and that expressive power is shared by things as well as human thought or speech. This metaphysical principle of expression has combined with the introspective psychology and emphasis on discipline to form the foundation of the various aesthetic theories that have been so well developed in Japanese history.
         Neo-Confucianism became most prominent in Japan in the sixteenth century. Like classical Confucianism, it contributed much to the Japanese understanding of virtue and the nature of the social self. Unlike classical Confucianism in Japan, however, neo-Confucianism also had a metaphysical and epistemological influence. Its emphasis on investigating the principle or configuration of things stimulated the Japanese study of the natural world. This reinforced a tendency initiated with the very limited introduction of Western practical sciences and medicine in the sixteenth century.
         Western philosophy, along with Western science and technology, has had its major impact in Japan only since the middle of the nineteenth century. The process of modernization forced Japanese philosophers to reconsider fundamental issues in epistemology, social philosophy and philosophical anthropology. As it has assimilated Asian traditions of thought in the past – absorbing, modifying and incorporating aspects into its culture – so Japan has been consciously assimilating Western thought since the early twentieth century. The process continues today.
         What in all this is distinctively Japanese? On the superficial level, it might seem that Japan has drawn eclectically from a variety of traditions without any inherent sense of intellectual direction. A more careful analysis, however, shows that Japanese thinkers have seldom adopted any foreign philosophy without simultaneously adapting it. For example, the Japanese philosophical tradition never fully accepted the emphasis on propriety or the mandate of heaven so characteristic of Chinese Confucianism. It rejected the Buddhist idea that impermanence is a reality to which one must be resigned, and instead made the appreciation of impermanence into an aesthetic. It criticized the neo-Confucian and Western philosophical tendencies toward rationalism and positivism, even while accepting many ideas from those traditions. In short, there has always been a complex selection process at work beneath the apparent absorption of foreign ideas.
         Both historically and in the present, some Japanese philosophers and cultural critics have tried to identify this selection process with Shintō, but Shintō itself has also been profoundly shaped by foreign influences. The selection process has shaped Shintō as much as Shintō has shaped it. In any case, we can isolate a few axiological orientations that have seemed to persist or recur throughout the history of Japanese thought. First, there has been a tendency to emphasize immanence over transcendence in defining spirituality. Second, contextual pragmatism has generally won out over attempts to establish universal principles that apply to all situations. Third, reason has often been combined with affect as the basis of knowledge or insight. Fourth, theory is seldom formulated in isolation from a praxis used to learn the theory. Fifth, although textual authority has often been important, it has not been as singular in its focus as in many other cultures. Thus, the Japanese have not typically identified a single text such as the Bible, the Analects, the Qur’an or the Bhagavad Gītā as foundational to their culture. Although there have been exceptions to these general orientations, they do nonetheless help define the broader cultural backdrop against which the drama of Japanese philosophy has been played out through history."
10.4324/9780415249126-f005-1,Jaina philosophy,"The issues in Jaina philosophy developed concurrently with those that emerged in Buddhist and Hindu philosophy. The period from the second century bc to about the tenth century ad evinces a tremendous interaction between the schools of thought and even an exchange of ideas, borne out especially in the rich commentary literature on the basic philosophical works of the respective systems. Jaina philosophy shares with Buddhism and Hinduism the aim of striving, within its own metaphysical presuppositions, for absolute liberation (mokṣa or nirvāṇa) from the factors which bind human existence. For the philosophical systems of Indian thought, ignorance (of one’s own nature, of the nature of the world and of one’s role in the world) is one of the chief such factors, and Jainism offers its own insights into what constitutes the knowledge that has the soteriological function of overcoming ignorance. Jainism is not exempt from the problem of distinguishing the religious and/or mystical from the ‘philosophical’; the Indian tradition has no exact equivalents for these categories as they are usually employed in Western thought.
         The significance ascribed to knowledge is reflected in the attention given to epistemology and logic by Jaina philosophers. The first systematic account was given by the fourth- or fifth-century philosopher Umāsvāti, who distinguished two types of knowledge: partial knowledge, which is obtained from particular standpoints, and comprehensive knowledge, which is of five kinds – sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge, clairvoyance, telepathy and omniscience. Of these, the first two are held to be indirect (consisting in, or analogous to, inference) and the remainder are direct; Jainism is unique among Indian philosophies in characterizing sensory knowledge as indirect. The aim of the treatises on knowledge is to present what the Jainas believe would be known in the state of omniscience, as taught by Mahāvīra. Omniscience is an intrinsic condition of all souls; however, due to the influence of karma since beginningless time this essential quality of the soul is inhibited.
         The Jaina interest in logic arose, as with the other schools, through a consideration of inference as a mode of knowledge. The methods and terminology of the Nyāya school were heavily drawn upon; this is evident in Siddhasena Divākara’s Nyāyāvatāra (The Descent of Logic) (c. fifth century), one of the first detailed presentations of Jaina logic. The Jainas used logic to criticize other schools and defend their own. The acquaintance with other traditions that this implies is a notable aspect of classical Jainism; their interest in other schools, coupled with their belief in collecting and preserving manuscripts, makes the Jaina corpus very important for the study of classical Indian thought.
         According to Jaina ontology, reality is divided into the two basic principles of sentience and non-sentience, neither of which is reducible to the other. The former is manifested in souls, of which there are an infinite number, and the latter in the five basic substances, which are matter, dharma and adharma (factors posited to explain movement and rest), space and time. Matter consists of atoms; as it becomes associated with the soul, it gets attached to it, becomes transformed into karma and thereby restricts the functions of consciousness. This pernicious process can only be reversed through ascetic practices, which ultimately lead to liberation.
         Ascetic practices constitute the basis of Jaina ethics, the framework of which are the ‘five great vows’, according to which the ascetics vow to live. These are: nonviolence towards all forms of life, abstinence from lying, not taking what is not given, celibacy and renunciation of property. Nonviolence is strongly emphasized, since violence produces the greatest amount of karma. Hence great care has to be exercised at all times, especially because injury of life forms should be avoided also in plants, water, fire, etc. The minimization of physical activity to avoid injury is therefore an important ideal of Jaina asceticism. Inspiration for constant ethical behaviour is provided by a contemplation of the lives of the twenty-four Jinas, of whom Mahāvīra was the last. Though human, these ‘conquerors of the passions’ are worshipped as divine beings because of their conduct in the world and knowledge of the nature of ultimate reality."
10.4324/9780415249126-g201-1,"Buddhist philosophy, Korean","Buddhism was transmitted to the Korean peninsula from China in the middle of the fourth century ad. Korea at this time was divided into three kingdoms: Kokuryô, Paekche and Silla. Both Kokuryô and Paekche accepted Buddhism as a state religion immediately after it was introduced, to Kokuryô in 372 ad and to Paekche in 384 ad. However, it was not until two centuries later that Silla accepted Buddhism as a state religion. This was because Silla was the last of the three kingdoms to become established as a centralized power under the authority of one king.
         It is not coincidental that Buddhism was accepted by these three states at the very same time that a strong kingship, independent of the aristocracy, was created. These newly established kingships needed a new ideology with which to rule, separate from the age-old shamanistic tradition which had been honored among the previous loose confederations of tribes. Buddhism fulfilled this need. It became a highly valued tool which kings used shrewdly, not only to provide their societies with a political ideology but to give them a foundation from which to build a viable system of ethics and philosophical thinking. Given this historical legacy, Korean Buddhism came to possess a feature which set it apart from the other East Asian traditions: it became ‘state-protection’ Buddhism. Although this was not a particularly sophisticated phenomenon on a philosophical level, this feature had a lasting influence on all aspects of Buddhist thought in Korea. In general, Korean Buddhism has followed a course of development more or less parallel to that of the greater East Asian context, although with notably closer ties to China than to Japan. There is no historical evidence which indicates any direct intellectual transmission from India, Buddhism’s birthplace; rather, most of the philosophical development of Buddhism in Korea occurred as Korean monks travelled to China to study and obtain Buddhist texts which had either been written in or translated into Chinese. Despite such close ties to China, however, Korean Buddhism has developed its own identity, distinct from that of its progenitor.
         Compared to Indian and Central Asian Buddhism, which developed along clear historical lines, the development of Buddhism in China was largely dependent on the personalities of individual monks, and was thus affected by such factors as their region of origination and the particular texts which they emphasized. Thus, in the process of assimilating Indian Buddhism, the Chinese created and developed a number of widely varying schools of Buddhist thought. In Korea, however, such a diverse number of philosophical traditions was never established. Rather, one of the distinct features of Korean Buddhism has been its preference for incorporating many different perspectives into a single, cohesive body of thought."
10.4324/9780415249126-g002-1,"Buddhist philosophy, Chinese","When Buddhism first entered China from India and Central Asia two thousand years ago, Chinese favourably disposed towards it tended to view it as a part or companion school of the native Chinese Huang–Lao Daoist tradition, a form of Daoism rooted in texts and practices attributed to Huangdi (the Yellow Emperor) and Laozi. Others, less accepting of this ‘foreign’ incursion from the ‘barbarous’ Western Countries, viewed Buddhism as an exotic and dangerous challenge to the social and ethical Chinese civil order. For several centuries, these two attitudes formed the crucible within which the Chinese understanding of Buddhism was fashioned, even as more and more missionaries arrived (predominantly from Central Asia) bringing additional texts, concepts, rituals, meditative disciplines and other practices. Buddhists and Daoists borrowed ideas, terminology, disciplines, cosmologies, institutional structures, literary genres and soteric models from each other, sometimes so profusely that today it can be difficult if not impossible at times to determine who was first to introduce a certain idea. Simultaneously, polemical and political attacks from hostile Chinese quarters forced Buddhists to respond with apologia and ultimately reshape Buddhism into something the Chinese would find not only inoffensive, but attractive.
         In the fifth century ad, Buddhism began to extricate itself from its quasi-Daoist pigeonhole by clarifying definitive differences between Buddhist and Daoist thought, shedding Daoist vocabulary and literary styles while developing new distinctively Buddhist terminology and genres. Curiously, despite the fact that Mahāyāna Buddhism had few adherents in Central Asia and was outnumbered by other Buddhist schools in India as well, in China Mahāyāna became the dominant form of Buddhism, so much so that few pejoratives were as stinging to a fellow Buddhist as labelling him ‘Hīnayāna’ (literally ‘Little Vehicle,’ a polemical term for non-Mahāyānic forms of Buddhism). By the sixth century, the Chinese had been introduced to a vast array of Buddhist theories and practices representing a wide range of Indian Buddhist schools. As the Chinese struggled to master these doctrines it became evident that, despite the fact that these schools were all supposed to express the One Dharma (Buddha’s Teaching), their teachings were not homogenous, and were frequently incommensurate.
         By the end of the sixth century, the most pressing issue facing Chinese Buddhists was how to harmonize the disparities between the various teachings. Responses to this issue produced the Sinitic Mahāyāna schools, that is, Buddhist schools that originated in China rather than India. The four Sinitic schools are Tiantai, Huayan, Chan and Pure Land (Jingtu). Issues these schools share in common include Buddha-nature, mind, emptiness, tathāgatagarbha, expedient means (upāya), overcoming birth and death (saṃsāra), and enlightenment."
10.4324/9780415249126-n016-1,"Emotions, philosophy of","Emotions have always played a role in philosophy, even if philosophers have usually denied them centre stage. Because philosophy has so often been described as first and foremost a discipline of reason, the emotions have often been neglected or attacked as primitive, dangerous or irrational. Socrates reprimanded his pupil Crito, advising that we should not give in to our emotions, and some of the ancient Stoic philosophers urged a life of reason free from the enslavement of the emotions, a life of apatheia (apathy). In Buddhism, too, much attention has been given to the emotions, which are treated as ‘agitations’ or klesas. Buddhist ‘liberation’, like the Stoic apatheia, becomes a philosophical ideal, freedom from the emotions.
         Philosophers have not always downgraded the emotions, however. Aristotle defended the view that human beings are essentially rational animals, but he also stressed the importance of having the right emotions. David Hume, the eighteenth-century empiricist, insisted that ‘reason is, and ought to be, the slave of the passions’. In the nineteenth century, although Hegel described the history of philosophy as the development of reason he also argued that ‘nothing great is ever done without passion’. Much of the history of philosophy can be told in terms of the shifting relationship between the emotions (or ‘passions’) and reason, which are often at odds, at times seem to be at war, but ideally should be in harmony. Thus Plato painted a picture of the soul as a chariot with three horses, reason leading the appetites and ‘the spirited part’, working together. Nietzsche, at the end of the nineteenth century, suggested that ‘every passion contains its own quantum of reason’.
         Nietzsche’s suggestion, that emotion and reason are not really opposites but complementary or commingled, has been at the heart of much of the debate about emotions since ancient times. Are emotions intelligent, or are they simply physical reactions? Are they mere ‘feelings’, or do they play a vital role in philosophy and in our lives?"
10.4324/9780415249126-n032-1,Materialism in the philosophy of mind,"Materialism – which, for almost all purposes, is the same as physicalism – is the theory that everything that exists is material. Natural science shows that most things are intelligible in material terms, but mind presents problems in at least two ways. The first is consciousness, as found in the ‘raw feel’ of subjective experience. The second is the intentionality of thought, which is the property of being about something beyond itself; ‘aboutness’ seems not to be a physical relation in the ordinary sense.
         There have been three ways of approaching these problems. The hardest is eliminativism, according to which there are no ‘raw feels’, no intentionality and, in general, no mental states: the mind and all its furniture are part of an outdated science that we now see to be false. Next is reductionism, which seeks to give an account of our experience and of intentionality in terms which are acceptable to a physical science: this means, in practice, analysing the mind in terms of its role in producing behaviour. Finally, the materialist may accept the reality and irreducibility of mind, but claim that it depends on matter in such an intimate way – more intimate than mere causal dependence – that materialism is not threatened by the irreducibility of mind. The first two approaches can be called ‘hard materialism’, the third ‘soft materialism’.
         The problem for eliminativism is that we find it difficult to credit that any belief that we think and feel is a theoretical speculation. Reductionism’s main difficulty is that there seems to be more to consciousness than its contribution to behaviour: a robotic machine could behave as we do without thinking or feeling. The soft materialist has to explain supervenience in a way that makes the mind not epiphenomenal without falling into the problems of interactionism."
10.4324/9780415249126-r005-1,"Economics, philosophy of","People have thought about economics for as long as they have thought about how to manage their households, indeed Aristotle compared the study of the economic affairs of a city to the study of the management of a household. During the two millennia between Aristotle and Adam Smith, one finds reflections concerning economic problems mainly in the context of discussions of moral or policy questions. For example, scholastic philosophers commented on money and interest in inquiries concerning the justice of ‘usury’ (charging interest on money loans), and in the seventeenth century there was a great deal of discussion of policy concerning foreign trade. Economics only emerged as a distinct field of study with the bold eighteenth-century idea that there were ‘economies’ – that is autonomous law-governed systems of human interaction involving production, distribution and exchange. This view was already well developed in Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations, from which much of economics derives.
         Economics is of philosophical interest in three main regards: it raises moral questions concerning welfare, justice and freedom; it raises foundational questions concerning the nature of rationality; and it raises methodological or epistemological questions concerning the character and possibility of knowledge of social phenomena. The fundamental theory of standard orthodox economics is of particular epistemological interest because of its resemblance to theories in the natural sciences coupled with its uneven empirical performance.
         More than 150 years ago John Stuart Mill confronted the problem of how to reconcile his high regard for economics (despite its empirical adequacies) with his commitment to empiricism. His solution, which was accepted by most economists until the 1930s, held that the basic principles of economics are well established by introspection or everyday experience. One can thus justifiably have confidence in economics, despite the inexactness of its implications, which is only to be expected, since economics deals only with the most important determinants of economic phenomena.
         In the 1930s Mill’s views were rejected as too dogmatic and insufficiently empirical. But the views that succeeded Mill’s during the generation after the Second World War, most notably the position of Milton Friedman and views deriving from the work of Karl Popper and Imre Lakatos, were less able to deal satisfactorily with the empirical inadequacies of economic theories than were Mill‘s. Since the mid 1980s there have been several new approaches, ranging from Donald McCloskey’s rejection of methodological assessment at one extreme to Alexander Rosenberg’s conclusion that economics cannot be a successful empirical science at the other."
10.4324/9780415249126-r013-1,"History, philosophy of","Philosophy of history is the application of philosophical conceptions and analysis to history in both senses, the study of the past and the past itself. Like most branches of philosophy its intellectual origins are cloudy, but they lie in a refinement of ‘sacred’ histories, especially those of Judaism and Christianity. The first major philosopher to outline a scheme of world history was Immanuel Kant in The Idea of a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View (1784), and German Idealism also produced Hegel’sLectures on the Philosophy of World History (1837), a much longer and more ambitious attempt to make philosophical sense of the history of the world as a whole. According to Hegel, history is rational, the working out, in fact, of philosophical understanding itself.
         The accelerating success of natural science in the nineteenth century gave rise to a powerful combination of empiricism and logical positivism which produced a philosophical climate highly unfavourable to Hegelian philosophy of history. The belief became widespread among philosophers that Hegel, and Marx after him, had developed a priori theories that ignored historical contingency in favour of historical necessity, and which were empirically unfalsifiable. Karl Popper’s philosophy of science was especially influential in converting philosophy of history to a new concern with the methods of historical study rather than with the shape of the past. Two rival conceptions of historical method existed. One tried to model explanation in history on what they took to be the form of explanation in science, and argued for the existence of ‘covering laws’ by which historians connect the events they seek to explain. The other argued for a distinctive form of explanation in history, whose object was the meaning of human action and whose structure was narrative rather than deductive.
         Neither side in this debate was able to claim a convincing victory, with the result that philosophers gradually lost interest in history and began to concern themselves more generally with the nature of human action. This interest, combined with a revival of nineteenth-century German hermeneutics, the study of texts in their social and cultural milieu, in turn revived interest among analytical philosophers in the writings of Hegel and Nietzsche. The impact of continental influences in philosophy, art criticism and social theory was considerable, and reintroduced a historical dimension that had been largely absent from twentieth-century analytical philosophy. In particular, the formation of fundamental philosophical ideas began to be studied as a historical process. The Enlightenment came to be seen as a crucial period in the development of philosophy, and of modernity more generally, and with this understanding came the belief that the contemporary Western world is postmodern. In this way, social theory and the philosophy of culture in fact returned, albeit unawares, to the ‘grand narrative’ tradition in philosophy of history."
10.4324/9780415249126-t071-1,Natural law in early modern philosophy ,"Are there moral norms for action applicable in all times and places? It was common in the early modern period to answer ‘Yes’ to this question and to appeal to natural law as expressing those norms.
         Natural law developed in the early modern period through the work of Suarez, Grotius, Hobbes, Cumberland and Pufendorf, among others. Natural law is a universal, obligatory set of rules for action, known without revelation and legislated by God. The phrase ‘natural law’ carries with it a set of claims about moral norms – where they originate, what justifies them, how we know them.
         Early modern natural law has roots in the ancients (particularly in Stoicism) and Christianity. It is a standard part of medieval and early modern Aristotelian moral philosophy, where it informs discussions of law, moral action, and the Ten Commandments. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, however, one sees something novel: philosophers claiming that moral philosophy is fundamentally legal or jural or, even more pronounced, nothing other than natural law. On a jural view of morality, moral principles are imposed – in some sense or other – through legislation. It has often been claimed that this marks a break between modern and pre-modern moral philosophies – from views oriented by happiness, good and virtue to views focused on obligation, law, right, duty and authority.
         The most important differences between a scholastic or eudaimonistic conception and a natural law or jural conception of moral philosophy arise in claims about the summum bonum (highest good), the emphasis on law, action and justice, and the nature of moral reasons. Perhaps, most generally, natural law can be thought of as reorganizing morality towards the goal of adjudicating conflict, particularly among religious confessions, warring states, traders and alien cultures.
         Natural law informed much academic moral philosophy in the eighteenth century and exerted strong influence on moral and political thought (for example, the American Declaration of Independence). By the nineteenth century, however, utilitarian and historicist critics attacked the ideas of morality as law and of timeless, universal norms as constituting morality. In the present day, natural law ideas are manifest in the human rights tradition."
10.4324/9780415249126-u026-1,Ordinary language philosophy,"Ordinary language philosophy is a method of doing philosophy, rather than a set of doctrines. It is diverse in its methods and attitudes. It belongs to the general category of analytic philosophy, which has as its principal goal the analysis of concepts rather than the construction of a metaphysical system or the articulation of insights about the human condition. The method is to use features of certain words in ordinary or non-philosophical contexts as an aid to doing philosophy. The uses in non-philosophical contexts are taken to be paradigmatic; it is in them that meaning lives and moves and has its being. All ordinary language philosophers agree that classical philosophy suffered from an inadequate methodology that accounts for the lack of progress. But proponents of the method do not agree about whether philosophical problems are solved or dissolved; that is, they do not agree about whether philosophical problems are genuine problems for which there are solutions or whether they are merely pseudo-problems, which can at best be diagnosed."
10.4324/0123456789-dd3596-1,Twentieth-century philosophy,"Although it is difficult to generalize, twentieth-century philosophy has a number of broadly characteristic and widely shared concerns. These include the ambition to clarify the nature and foundations of scientific knowledge; a concern with questions of meaning or sense in abeyance of assured theological or metaphysical foundations; questions about the role of mind, meaning, and value in the physical world; questions about the possibility and nature of an absolute or objective description of the world as a whole; questions about the relationship of language to thought and consciousness; and questions about the relationship of individual experience and freedom to broader systems of abstract rationality and collective practice. Much, though by no means all, of twentieth-century philosophy can be understood as taking or following the ""linguistic turn."" For philosophers within the linguistic turn, philosophical inquiry depends primarily on the investigation of public and intersubjectively shared language and linguistic meaning or its logical structure rather than the epistemological analysis of the subject-object relationship or the development of speculative, theological, or empirical results. The traditional problems of epistemology, ontology, metaphysics, and ethics can then best be taken up, or alternatively dissolved as pseudo-problems, by means of a systematic consideration of the language with which they are expressed. Despite the popularity of linguistic philosophy during much of the twentieth century, more recently many philosophers have turned away from the idea that philosophical explanation or argumentation should be grounded primarily in the analysis of language. Contemporary philosophy once more witnesses a robust field of discussion and argumentation about the possibility of substantive metaphysics, the ontology and structure of the world as such, and the proper aims and methods of philosophical practice.
         In its initial phases, twentieth-century philosophy is characterized programmatically by a number of strongly analytic, constructivist, or formalizing projects that attempt systematically to clarify or illuminate meaning, language, experience, or knowledge by means of a description or elucidation of their overall or underlying structure. It is typical of these initial projects (including those of logical positivism, phenomenology, structuralist linguistics, neo-Kantianism, and psychoanalysis) that they see themselves as, in one sense or another, scientific in motivation or spirit, rather than primarily as speculative or metaphysical, and as proceeding primarily by means of analysis rather than system-building. After World War II, central and organizing theses of these initial projects were subjected to varieties of internally motivated critique, which often challenged the coherence or philosophical utility of the idea of a comprehensive structure of meaning, of an a priori analysis of language or concepts, or the idea of any distinctive and well-defined methods of philosophy itself. Despite this, many of the broader methods and styles characteristic of these earlier projects continued, and they remain exemplary of the varieties of philosophical practice today."
10.4324/9780415249126-g001-1,Chinese philosophy,"Any attempt to survey an intellectual tradition which encompasses more than four thousand years would be a daunting task even if it could be presumed that the reader shares, at least tacitly, many of the assumptions underlying that tradition. However, no such commonalities can be assumed in attempting to introduce Asian thinking to Western readers. Until the first Jesuit incursions in the late sixteenth century, China had developed in virtual independence of the Indo-European cultural experience and China and the Western world remained in almost complete ignorance of one another.
         The dramatic contrast between Chinese and Western modes of philosophic thinking may be illustrated by the fact that the tendency of European philosophers to seek out the being of things, the essential reality lying behind appearances, would meet with little sympathy among Chinese thinkers, whose principal interests lie in the establishment and cultivation of harmonious relationships within their social ambiance. Contrasted with Anglo-European philosophic traditions, the thinking of the Chinese is far more concrete, this-worldly and, above all, practical.
         One reason for this difference is suggested by the fact that cosmogonic and cosmological myths played such a minor role in the development of Chinese intellectual culture and that, as a consequence, Chinese eyes were focused not upon issues of cosmic order but upon more mundane questions of how to achieve communal harmony within a relatively small social nexus. The rather profound linguistic and ethnic localism of what Pliny the Elder described as a ‘stay-at-home’ China, reinforced by a relative freedom from intercultural contact, generated traditional radial communities in which moral, aesthetic and spiritual values could remain relatively implicit and unarticulated. By contrast, in the West these norms had to be abstracted and raised to the level of consciousness to adjudicate conflicts occasioned by the complex ethnic and linguistic interactions associated with the development of a civilization rooted almost from the beginning in the confluence of Greek, Hebrew, and Latin civilizations.
         The distinctive origins and histories of Chinese and Western civilizations are manifested in a number of important ways. The priority of logical reasoning in the West is paralleled in China by the prominence of less formal uses of analogical, parabolic and literary discourse. The Chinese are largely indifferent to abstract analyses that seek to maintain an objective perspective, and are decidedly anthropocentric in their motivations for the acquisition, organization and transmission of knowledge. The disinterest in dispassionate speculations upon the nature of things, and a passionate commitment to the goal of social harmony was dominant throughout most of Chinese history. Indeed, the interest in logical speculations on the part of groups such as the sophists and the later Mohists was short-lived in classical China.
         The concrete, practical orientation of the Chinese toward the aim of communal harmony conditioned their approach toward philosophical differences. Ideological conflicts were seen, not only by the politicians but by the intellectuals themselves, to threaten societal well-being. Harmonious interaction was finally more important to these thinkers than abstract issues of who had arrived at the ‘truth’. Perhaps the most obvious illustration of the way the Chinese handled their theoretical conflicts is to be found in mutual accommodation of the three emergent traditions of Chinese culture, Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism. Beginning in the Han dynasty (206 bc–ad 220), the diverse themes inherited from the competing ‘hundred schools’ of pre-imperial China were harmonized within Confucianism as it ascended to become the state ideology. From the Han synthesis until approximately the tenth century ad, strong Buddhist and religious Daoist influences continued to compete with persistent Confucian themes, while from the eleventh century to the modern period, Neoconfucianism – a Chinese neoclassicism – absorbed into itself these existing tensions and those that would emerge as China, like it or not, confronted Western civilization.
         In the development of modern China, when Western influence at last seemed a permanent part of Chinese culture, the values of traditional China have remained dominant. For a brief period, intellectual activity surrounding the May Fourth movement in 1919 seemed to be leading the Chinese into directions of Western philosophic interest. Visits by Bertrand Russell and John Dewey, coupled with a large number of Chinese students seeking education in Europe, Great Britain and the USA, promised a new epoch in China’s relations with the rest of the world. However, the Marxism that Mao Zedong sponsored in China was ‘a Western heresy with which to confront the West’. Mao’s Marxism quickly took on a typically ‘Chinese’ flavour, and China’s isolation from Western intellectual currents continued essentially unabated."
10.4324/9780415249126-g101-1,"Buddhist philosophy, Japanese","Buddhism transformed Japanese culture and in turn was transformed in Japan. Mahāyāna Buddhist thought entered Japan from the East Asian continent as part of a cultural complex that included written language, political institutions, formal iconography and Confucian literature. From its introduction in the sixth century through to the sixteenth century, Japanese Buddhism developed largely by incorporating Chinese Buddhism, accommodating indigenous beliefs and reconciling intersectarian disputes. During the isolationist Tokugawa Period (1600–1868), neo-Confucian philosophy and Dutch science challenged the virtual hegemony of Buddhist ways of thinking, but served more often as alternative and sometimes complementary models than as incompatible paradigms. Only since the reopening of Japan in 1868 has Japanese Buddhist thought seriously attempted to come to terms with early Indian Buddhism, Western thought and Christianity.
         Through the centuries, Buddhism gave the Japanese people a way to make sense of life and death, to explain the world and to seek liberation from suffering. When it engaged in theorizing, it did so in pursuit of religious fulfilment rather than of knowledge for its own sake. As an extension of its practical bent, Japanese Buddhist thought often tended to collapse differences between Buddhism and other forms of Japanese religiosity, between this phenomenal world and any absolute realm, and between the means and end of enlightenment. These tendencies are not Japanese in origin, but they extended further in Japan than in other Buddhist countries and partially define the character of Japanese Buddhist philosophy.
         In fact, the identity of ‘Japanese Buddhist philosophy’ blends with almost everything with which we would contrast it. As a development and modification of Chinese traditions, there is no one thing that is uniquely Japanese about it; as a Buddhist tradition, it is characteristically syncretistic, often assimilating Shintō and Confucian philosophy in both its doctrines and practices. Rituals, social practices, political institutions and artistic or literary expressions are as essential as philosophical ideas to Japanese Buddhism.
         Disputes about ideas often arose but were seldom settled by force of logical argument. One reason for this is that language was used not predominately in the service of logic but for the direct expression and actualization of reality. Disputants appealed to the authority of Buddhist sūtras because these scriptures were thought to manifest a direct understanding of reality. Further, as reality was thought to be all-inclusive, the better position in the dispute would be that which was more comprehensive rather than that which was more consistent but exclusive. Politics and practical consequences did play a role in the settling of disputes, but the ideal of harmony or conformity often prevailed.
         The development of Japanese Buddhist philosophy can thus be seen as the unfolding of major themes rather than a series of philosophical positions in dispute. These themes include the role of language in expressing truth; the non-dual nature of absolute and relative, universal and particular; the actualization of liberation in this world, life or body; the equality of beings; and the transcendent non-duality of good and evil."
10.4324/9780415249126-n082-1,"Slovakia, philosophy in","Until as late as 1918, social and national circumstances were not favourable to the development of philosophy in Slovakia. The enforced retardation of the country had an obviously negative impact on intellectual and cultural life, and stood in the way of the possibility of diversity. That is why the first important Slovak philosophers such as Bayer and Caban emerged only as recently as the seventeenth century. Following this, philosophers of the Enlightenment such as Karlovský, Laurentzy, Steigel and Feješ started to criticize the anti-scientific ideas which still survived. In the first phase of the National Revival Movement, Jan Kollár created a new philosophy of history by postulating the cultural unity of the Slavs. A specific contribution to this theory came from L. Štúr and his followers (Hurban, Hodža, Kellner) who applied it to practical conditions and stressed the necessity of national emancipation for the Slovak nation. Their influence is evident in all further developments of the national movement and its philosophy.
         The end of the nineteenth century saw the replacement of this idea by the philosophy of Thomas Masaryk. Slovak cultural life and philosophy, however, only began to develop fully in the context of an independent Czechoslovak Republic after 1918. The mainstream philosophy of the time was rationalistic, evident in the thought of such thinkers as Sv. Štúr, Koreň and Osuský. Philosophy after 1945 was marked by the achievements of Hrušovský, his students and colleagues, whose initial form of neopositivism took on a Marxist dialectical structurology. The importance of Marxism has recently been gradually declining and the Slovak philosophic scene is independently evolving in an atmosphere more in line with other European countries, particularly since the formation of the Slovak Republic in 1993."
10.4324/9780415249126-n003-1,"South Slavs, philosophy of","Philosophy as a distinct intellectual activity emerged in the coastal towns of the Adriatic during the Renaissance. Philosophers from this area wrote in Latin and taught philosophy in Italy, Germany and Austria. The first popular philosophical works in the vernacular did not appear until late in the eighteenth century, and it was almost one hundred years later that the first chairs in logic and philosophy were founded in the universities. Academic philosophy, usually derived from German or British models, was thus brought into the intellectual life of South Slavs. Local academic philosophers, mostly educated in Germany, brought home a variety of philosophical approaches, and by the early twentieth century many schools of thought flourished: Neo-Kantianism flourished in Beograd, while Neo-Thomism was particularly strong in Ljubljana and Zagreb (until 1941 the Meinongian phenomenological approach also flourished in Ljubljana). In their quest for originality, local philosophers constructed various eclectic philosophical systems.
         The Soviet Marxism-Leninism, imposed in all Yugoslav universities after 1945, was replaced in the late 1950s by a Neo-Marxist approach based on the concept of praxis. This was a concept of a purposeful human activity which, among other things, results in social change (for example, the development of socialism). These Neo-Marxists engaged in vigorous debates on the nature of truth and knowledge, on human freedom, alienation, socialism and humanism as well as on social and political issues. Their work reached an international audience through the international journal Praxis, published in Zagreb, and through their international summer school of philosophy at Korčula. As their support for the Yugoslav communist regime turned into open criticism, the regime halted the publication of Praxis and in 1974 forced the Beograd Neo-Marxists from their teaching posts.
         The Neo-Marxist interest in non-Marxist philosophy facilitated the reception of various non-Marxist approaches. From the early 1960s, existentialism, structuralism, hermeneutics and phenomenology – in particular the philosophy of Heidegger – exerted considerable influence on Neo-Marxists as well as on philosophers who had gradually abandoned this approach. In the early 1970s, a younger generation of thinkers in Beograd, Zagreb, Ljubljana and Zadar developed an interest in analytic philosophy. Since that time no approach or trend in philosophy has emerged as the dominant one in any of the academic centres in the countries which were formerly part of Yugoslavia."
10.4324/9780415249126-c020-1,"Language, Renaissance philosophy of","Renaissance philosophy of language is in its essentials a continuation of medieval philosophy of language as it developed in the fourteenth century. However, there were three big changes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. First, humanism led to a much greater interest in the practical study of languages, including Greek, Hebrew and vernacular languages, as well as classical Latin. Literary analysis and eloquent discourse were emphasized. Second, there was a loss of interest in such medieval developments as supposition theory, which meant that there was little discussion in logic texts of how words relate to each other in propositional contexts, and how sense and reference are affected by the presence of such logical terms as ‘all’, ‘none’, ‘only’, ‘except’ and so on. Only in early sixteenth-century Paris were these issues pursued with any enthusiasm. Third, the fourteenth-century insistence that both words and concepts were signs had several effects. There was a new interest in the classification of different sorts of signs, both linguistic and non-linguistic, particularly in the work of some early sixteenth-century Spaniards. Naturally significant mental language was emphasized in a way that diverted the attention of logicians from spoken languages and their imperfections. Finally, concepts themselves came in for more attention, so that many of the topics discussed by logicians overlapped with what would now count as philosophy of mind, as well as with metaphysics. For instance, philosophers in the late scholastic tradition made much use of an early fourteenth-century distinction between the formal concept, which is a representative act of mind, and the so-called objective concept, which is whatever it is that is represented by a formal concept. The discussion of these issues by such writers as Pedro da Fonseca and Francisco Suárez has an obvious bearing on developments in early modern philosophy."
10.4324/9780415249126-n078-1,Native American philosophy,"Native American philosophies are multiple and multiply different, though with some palpable commonalities. Cosmologically, Native American thought posits phased differentiations of form from a primordial void. Form is fundamentally animate, and widespread metaphysical premises indicate a pervasive animism. The relationship between language and reality is grounded in the semiotic manipulation of animate forces. Encompassing force – like Siouan wakan or Iroquoian orenda – is the originating source of human ontology and subjectivity, which are strongly characterized by ideas of consciousness and will. Mind is critically informed by transcendental experience (dreams, visions and so on) as well as by reason. Ethically, the harnessing of individual energies to specified social goals is discursively and dramatically prominent especially in ritual performance. Ethical principles are extended to non-human ‘persons’ (particularly animals and deific forms) who operate within the human moral compass. Native American reason emphasizes analogy (especially in Lévi-Strauss’ interpretations) and aetiology, and there is a central concern with formal composition and decomposition. The latter is strongly evident in the ubiquitous philosopher-figure ‘Trickster’ – a subversive transgressor of constituted order."
10.4324/9780415249126-q043-1,Heideggerian philosophy of science,"Heidegger’s importance in the philosophy of science stems less from his scattered remarks about science than from the larger conception of intentionality and ontology that informs them. Heidegger’s earliest major work, Being and Time (1927), displayed everyday practical purposive activity as the most fundamental setting for the disclosure of things in the world. Heidegger claimed that the traditional epistemological conception of a subject who represents objects was derivative from and dependent upon such ongoing everyday practical engagement with one’s surroundings. Science was then supposed to be the practice that allows things to show themselves shorn of their significance within the ’in-order-to-for-the-sake-of’ structure of everyday activity; nevertheless, the sense of scientific claims remained dependent upon the everyday interactions from which they were abstracted.
         Shortly after writing Being and Time, Heidegger revised his project in ways that also transformed his account of science. His overall project shifted from describing the transcendental structure of the meaning of being, to interpreting the ’history of being’. Science was reinterpreted as an activity (’research’) closely allied with machine technology, and oriented towards more extensive and intensive manipulation and ordering of things. Understood as such, science for Heidegger was an essential manifestation of the modern age. Whereas, earlier, he thought that science presupposed a philosophical ontology, he eventually portrayed science and technology as the conclusion of the philosophical tradition. While philosophical metaphysics and epistemology were thus naturalized, Heidegger was concerned with the possibility of a way of thinking outside this convergence of scientific and philosophical metaphysics."
10.4324/9780415249126-q069-1,"Medicine, philosophy of","The philosophy of medicine can be generally defined as encompassing those issues in epistemology, axiology, logic, methodology and metaphysics generated by or related to medicine. Issues have frequently focused on the nature of the practice of medicine, on concepts of health and disease, and on understanding the kind of knowledge that physicians employ in diagnosing and treating patients.
         The history of philosophical reflections concerning medicine reaches back to ancient Greece. Medical knowledge took a further step in the nineteenth century with the introduction of clinical pathological correlations, statistical methods, and systematic experimentation, out of which grew substantive literature exploring the character of medical reasoning and the framing of diagnoses. Debates also developed over contrasting physiological, ontological, nominalist and realist accounts of disease entities.
         Contemporary philosophy of medicine has been concerned with the nature of medicine in an increasingly scientific context, a concern that has generated several models of medicine, including George Engel’s biopsychosocial model, as well as analyses of the nature of the physician–patient interaction. The longstanding debate over the ontological status of health and disease has been recapitulated and extended by a number of authors, favouring an objective, statistically-based account, while others argue for an irreducible social and valuational element in these concepts. Several approaches to diagnostic logic, including Bayesian and computer-based analyses, have been developed, and sophisticated methods of determining disease causation and therapeutic efficacy, including analyses of the randomized clinical trial, have also been explored. Whether the philosophy of medicine is a distinct discipline or a branch of the philosophy of science has provoked vigorous arguments."
10.4324/9780415249126-q103-1,"Technology, philosophy of","The philosophy of technology deals with the nature of technology and its effects on human life and society. The increasing influence of modern technology on human existence has triggered a growing interest in a philosophical analysis of technology. Nevertheless, the philosophy of technology as a coherent field of research does not yet exist. The subject covers studies from almost every branch of thinking in philosophy and deals with a great variety of topics because of a lack of consensus about the primary meaning of the term ‘technology’, which may, among others, refer to a collection of artifacts, a form of human action, a form of knowledge or a social process.
         Among the most fundamental issues are two demarcation problems directly related to the definition of technology. The first concerns the distinction between technological (artificial) and natural objects. It involves the relation between man, nature and culture. The second pertains to the distinction between science and technology as types of knowledge. The science–technology relationship has become of central importance because of the widespread assumption that the distinguishing feature of modern technology, as compared to traditional forms of technology, is that it is science-based. Another much discussed issue is the autonomy of technology. It deals with the question of whether technology follows its own inevitable course of development, irrespective of its social, political, economic and cultural context."
10.4324/9780415249126-r015-1,"Social science, history of philosophy of","The history of social science can conveniently be divided into four uneven periods, starting with the beginnings of both western science and philosophy in the ancient Greek polis (city or state). It is fair to say, with qualifications, that the debate generated by the so-called Sophists, professional teachers of rhetoric in fifth-century Athens, established what would become the central questions for the future. The fundamental issue could be put thus: is society ‘natural’ or is it ‘conventional’, a historical product of human activities which vary across time and space? The Sophists, often abused in our standard histories, supported the conventional view. They held that even if it was anthropologically necessary that Homo sapiens live in societies, nature was silent about the character and ends of society. They thus defended what might be called ‘cultural relativism’. By contrast Aristotle argued that some men were ‘naturally’ slaves and that all women were ‘naturally’ inferior; therefore slavery and patriarchy were dictated by nature, a view that prevailed well into the early modern period.
         Beginning in the sixteenth century we find a host of thinkers who reconceived the problem first raised by the Sophists. Many of them, for example, Hobbes, Rousseau and Adam Smith, held that ‘by nature’ humans had similar capacities and powers. Inequalities of power were ‘artificial’, wholly the result of historically established conventions. These writers also rejected the idea that society was a kind of natural community. For many of them, society existed by consent, the result of a contract.
         The rejection of Aristotelianism was inspired by the Copernican revolution and the new physics of Galileo and Newton. This produced a self-conscious effort by early modern writers to articulate the idea of human science, modelled on the new physics. This critical idea was well put by the physiocrat Francois Quesnay: ‘All social facts are linked together in the bond of eternal, immutable, ineluctable, inevitable laws, which individuals and government would obey if they were once known to them’ (Randall 1940: 323).
         The third period, roughly the nineteenth century, is then a battleground over both the idea of science and the idea of a human science. The paradigm provided by celestial mechanics was nearly overwhelming; even so, there was disagreement as regards its character, especially as regards the question of causality and explanation. Until very recently, ‘positivists’ have tended to prevail. That is, writers have followed Auguste Comte, who gave us the terms ‘positivism’ and ‘sociology’, and who held there were social laws which were to be analysed as ‘relations of invariable succession’: whenever this, then that.
         As regards the possibility of a human science, consciousness and the problem of a free will raised the biggest questions. Materialists found nothing special about either; idealists did. Indeed a surprising amount of the most recent debates in the philosophy of the social sciences have their roots in these issues. If, as positivists insist, activity is governed by law, then what of human freedom? On the other hand, if humans have collectively made society and thus can remake it, then what is the nature of a human science?"
10.4324/9780415249126-r042-1,"Anthropology, philosophy of","Anthropology, like philosophy, is multifaceted. It studies humans’ physical, social, cultural and linguistic development, as well as their material culture, from prehistoric times up to the present, in all parts of the world. Some anthropological sub-fields have strong ties with the physical and biological sciences; others identify more closely with the social sciences or humanities. Within cultural and social anthropology differing theoretical approaches disagree about whether anthropology can be a science. The question of how it is possible to understand cultures different from one’s own, and to transmit that knowledge to others is central to anthropology because its answer determines the nature of the discipline. Philosophy of anthropology examines the definitions of basic anthropological concepts, the objectivity of anthropological claims and the nature of anthropological confirmation and explanation. It also examines the problems in value theory that arise when anthropologists confront cultures that do not share their own society’s standards."
10.4324/9780415249126-s025-1,Feminist political philosophy,"In all its forms, feminism asserts that social and political structures in society discriminate against women. Feminist political philosophy aims to show how traditional political philosophy is implicated in that discrimination and how the resources of political philosophy may nevertheless be employed in the service of women. Sometimes, feminist political philosophy extends the arguments of traditional political philosophy to indicate that women are unjustly treated and to propose ways in which that injustice might be removed. This is clearest in liberal feminism, where it is argued that since women are essentially the same as men in being rational creatures, they are entitled to the same legal and political rights as men: arguments which defend the rights of man also support the rights of women. Similarly, Marxist and socialist feminism extend the insights of Marxism and socialism in an attempt to expose and remove the oppression of women: Marxist emphasis on the exploitation of labour under capital is supplemented by Marxist feminist emphasis on the exploitation of women under patriarchy.
         However, there are also forms of feminist political philosophy which are more critical of traditional political philosophy and which question the very distinctions upon which it is premised. Thus, radical feminist philosophers question the scope of the term ‘political’ as it is usually used by political philosophers, and argue that by excluding domestic concerns, traditional political philosophy excludes many of the things which are most important to women. The aim here is not to extend the insights of political philosophy, but rather to highlight the ways in which political philosophy itself shows a distinct gender bias.
         Yet more radically, the postmodernists have been critical of philosophy’s emphasis on truth and objectivity, and some feminists have extended their arguments to suggest that the very language of philosophy, and by extension of political philosophy, is ‘man-made’.
         Feminist political philosophy is therefore not one thing but many, and feminist political philosophers are deeply divided as to whether traditional political philosophy may be modified so as to include women’s interests, or whether it is itself one of the ways in which women’s politically disadvantaged position is legitimized and perpetuated."
10.4324/9780415249126-s102-1,"Political philosophy, Confucian","Confucianism is a tradition of ethical and political thought in which ethics and politics are tightly connected. Confucianism endorses a politics of virtue that can be understood in two ways. First, politics in Confucianism aims to promote certain virtues and social relationships it defines as good; second, Confucianism conceives that politics can be successful only if the people in power are virtuous. Confucian political philosophy is therefore a kind of perfectionism which says that the state should promote the good life, and it is therefore directly opposed to the contemporary liberal view that the state and its officials should take no stance regarding what constitutes the good life. This entry introduces the Confucian vision of politics and explores its implications for three issues, namely: the source of political authority, the scope of people’s rights and liberties, and the responsibilities of the state towards its people’s welfare. The politics of virtue as conceived in Confucianism naturally tends to endorse rule by the wise instead of rule by the many; it tends to stress the need for people to cultivate virtues rather than to enjoy rights and liberties; and it sees people’s care for the poor and needy as stemming from virtues or duties rather than imperatives of social equality or justice. Despite this natural tendency, however, it is not obvious that the politics of virtue leaves no room for democracy, rights, and egalitarian justice. Indeed some commentators have argued that a number of these liberal-democratic ideas are either present in Confucianism or consistent with its central tenets. It is arguable that classical Confucian texts do not contain any ideas of democracy, human rights, or egalitarian justice, but do leave room for endorsement of the first two ideals under certain circumstances."
10.4324/9780415249126-s108-1,"Political philosophy, Jewish","Jewish ideas about politics are embedded in the traditional genres of Judaic discourse, more often legal or homiletic than systematically philosophical. A defining feature of this tradition is its historical setting, as for most of their history the Jews lacked a state. Still, central issues of political thought were addressed primarily in the context of Judaism’s characteristic political entity, the medieval kahal – the by and large autonomous urban Jewish community. Discussions of issues such as authority, justice, or membership were informed by the Talmudic legal tradition, by biblical memories of Israel’s monarchic period and by dreams of restoration, inspired by ancient prophecies regarding the messianic era.
         The central form defining political authority and allegiance is the covenant, enacted at Sinai between God and the Israelite people, whom He had elected and liberated from Egypt. The people recognized God’s supreme authority, consenting to live by His teachings, the Torah. The significance and demands of this divine election, and the parameters and requirements of membership of the covenantal community, are much-debated issues in the Jewish political tradition. Of equal concern are the concrete implications of divine sovereignty. On one view, this precludes any institutionalized form of human authority. On other views, divine authority is invested in one or more of various human agents, from kings and priests to prophets and rabbis; strikingly, the latter used their own reason to interpret God’s words, and in their assemblies would take a vote to decide among interpretations. In uneasy co-existence with these, the tradition includes prominent justifications for human political agency, the legitimacy of which derives not from divine authorization but from popular consent.
         Living as a (sometimes) tolerated minority under non-Jewish rulers, the Jews dreamed of redemption, imagining the messianic king as leading them to triumph. Yet the foundational tale in Genesis is of humankind as one family, and the biblical prophets envisage world peace.
         Since 1948 the state of Israel has become the locus for re-examination of the Jewish political tradition. A crucial question has been to what extent this tradition, which includes proto-democratic as well as theocratic elements, can inform political discourse in a modern democracy whose citizens are mostly Jewish but include also significant non-Jewish minorities."
10.4324/9780415249126-b079-1,"Natural philosophy, medieval","Medieval Latin natural philosophy falls into two main periods, before the rise of the universities (mainly in the twelfth century, when works were produced in connection with aristocratic patrons, monastic institutions or cathedral schools) and after their rise. In the earlier period, the dominant Greek influence is that part of Plato’s Timaeus which had been translated into Latin and commented on by Calcidius. In the university period, the central works are those of Aristotle, often together with commentaries by Averroes.
         Before the twelfth century, there was very little that could be described as natural philosophy. Such work as existed fell mainly into the genres of natural history (encyclopedic works using Pliny and the like as sources), didactic works (perhaps following a question and answer format on the model of Seneca’s Natural Questions) or biblical commentary (especially commentaries on the Hexaemeron, or six days of creation). In the twelfth century, however, there are a number of original texts that may be considered as natural philosophy; examples include William of Conches’ Philosophia mundi (Philosophy of the World), Bernard Sylvester’s Cosmographia or Hildegard of Bingen’s Scivias (Know the Ways). Greek natural philosophy also reached the Latin West through its influence on medical works and on art, for example on drawings of the cosmos, heaven, angels and hell.
         The high and late Middle Ages (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries) was perhaps the preeminent period in all of history for natural philosophy. Natural philosophy was an official area of study in the arts faculties of medieval universities, alongside and distinct from the seven liberal arts (the trivium – grammar, rhetoric and logic – and the quadrivium – arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music), moral philosophy or ethics, and first philosophy or metaphysics. As a subject of the arts faculty, natural philosophy was also defined as distinct from the subjects studied in the graduate faculties of theology, medicine and law.
         The most common approach to natural philosophy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was to comment on, or to dispute questions arising from, the natural works of Aristotle, especially his Physics, On the Heavens, On Generation and Corruption, Meteorology and On the Soul, as well as his various works in biological areas and the so-called Parva Naturalia, a group of short works on psychological topics. Medieval investigations of the cosmos that were largely mathematical – for example, most of astronomy – were considered in the Middle Ages to belong not to natural philosophy but to the quadrivium or perhaps to the so-called ‘middle sciences’ (such as optics, statics or the newly developed ‘science of motion’). What little medieval experimental science there may have been (for instance that appearing in Peter Peregrinus’ De magnete (On the Magnet), in Frederick II’s De arte venandi cum avibus (On the Art of Hunting with Birds) and perhaps in some works on alchemy) seems not to have been done within the university setting. In the fourteenth century the new methods of medieval logic (supposition theory, propositional analysis or exposition, rules for solving sophismata and so on) are prominently used in natural philosophy.
         Thirteenth- and fourteenth-century natural philosophy began with the general assumption of the Aristotelian world view, but later medieval natural philosophers did not hold to the Aristotelian view rigidly or dogmatically. In some cases, Christian faith seemed to contradict or to add to Aristotle’s ideas, and natural philosophers tried to resolve these contradictions or to make the appropriate additions, as in the case of heaven and hell and angels. A number of difficulties, inconsistencies and sticking points in Aristotle were special subjects for discussion and received new resolutions as time went on.
         Within the medieval university, natural philosophy was considered to be a part of general education, but it was also thought to be useful as a tool for theology and medicine. In northern universities such as Paris and Oxford, some of the most fundamental original work in natural philosophy was done in connection with the investigation of theological problems, for which natural philosophy, together with the other disciplines of the arts faculty, served as important aids. In Italian universities, where faculties of theology were less prominent or non-existent, natural philosophy was similarly tied to the resolution of medical questions.
         European libraries contain many manuscript commentaries on Aristotelian works that still await modern analysis. The medieval university system did not as a rule identify, encourage or reward originality or uniqueness. Many natural philosophers claimed to be explaining Aristotle’s meaning, even when they were introducing a novel interpretation of or variation on his ideas. When they made use of the ideas of earlier commentators, they rarely mentioned them by name. What we now know about medieval natural philosophy is not a mirror reflection of what happened in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, because modern scholars have chosen to study those subjects and individuals relevant to their own present situations: Dominicans have emphasized the history of Dominican natural philosophy in such thinkers as Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas, Franciscans have studied Franciscans such as John Duns Scotus and William of Ockham, historians of science have studied those individuals who had something to say about the subjects of modern science such as bodies, forces, velocities and resistances, logicians have studied logic, and so on. Because natural philosophy as such is not the focus of attention of many modern philosophers or other scholars, much medieval natural philosophy remains unread, sometimes in large-scale and handsomely produced commentaries on Aristotle’s works, sometimes in hastily scribbled student notebooks."
10.4324/9780415249126-k113-2,"Religion, philosophy of","Philosophy of religion comprises philosophical reflection on a wide range of religious and religiously significant phenomena: religious belief, doctrine and practice in general; the phenomenology and cognitive significance of religious experience; the authority and reliability of religious testimony; the significance of religious diversity and disagreement; the relationship between religion (or God, or the gods) and morality; the doctrines, practices and modes of cognition distinctive to particular religious traditions; and so on. It is as old as philosophy itself and has been a standard part of Western philosophy in every period (see Religion, history of philosophy of). Since the latter half of the twentieth century, there has been a great growth of interest in it, and the range of topics that philosophers of religion have considered has expanded considerably.
         Philosophy of religion is sometimes divided into philosophy of religion proper and philosophical theology. This distinction reflects the unease of an earlier period in analytic philosophy, during which philosophers felt that reflection on religion was philosophically respectable only if it abstracted away from particular religions, focusing on doctrines and problems shared in common by multiple religious traditions. But most philosophers now feel free to examine philosophically any aspect of religion, including the doctrines and practices peculiar to individual religions. Not only are the doctrines and practices of particular religions philosophically interesting in their own right, but also they often raise questions that are helpful for issues in other areas of philosophy. Reflection on the Christian notion of sanctification, for example, sheds light on certain contemporary debates over the nature of freedom of the will (see Sanctification). Likewise, reflection on Buddhist expressions of gratitude toward those who do one harm, or toward those whom one benefits, has been taken to shed light on the proper analysis of gratitude.
         As a result of the blurring of boundaries between philosophy of religion proper and philosophical theology, philosophy of religion has in recent years taken on an increasingly interdisciplinary character, with work in philosophy of religion engaging to a much greater degree with relevant work in systematic theology, historical theology and cognate areas in the study of other religions. Within the analytic tradition of philosophy, this interdisciplinary shift is perhaps most visible in the rise of ‘analytic theology’ (see Analytic theology)."
10.4324/9780415249126-a133-1,Immortality in ancient philosophy,"In Greco-Roman philosophy immortality is discussed in two contexts: as an uncontroversial attribute of the gods and as a highly controversial attribute of human souls. Subdividing this latter topic, one may discern a more metaphysical question about whether every human soul as such is immortal in virtue of its nature or essence, and a more ethical topic about whether certain souls may enjoy a greater degree or share of immortality through adopting a certain mode of life. (This sub-topic is joined to the first main topic, to the extent that the virtuous agent’s approximation to immortality is part of their imitation of god or homoiōsis theōi).
         Several Presocratic philosophers held that human souls are immortal, but it is Plato who first offers extensive arguments for this claim, as well as extensive reflections on the ethical import of personal immortality. Aristotle’s psychology leaves little room for the soul’s immortality, and it remains controversial whether he wished to leave any whatsoever. Discussions of immortality and its ethical consequences are similarly downplayed in surviving Stoic sources. The Epicureans gleefully argued the contrary view that a virtuous outlook depends on our conviction that we are irredeemably mortal. Only with the resurgence of Platonism in the Common Era does the soul’s immortality become once again a commonplace among philosophers. The connection between this and the Christian belief in resurrection is complicated. It is presumably due to the ascendancy of this double legacy that current popular usage counts it as nearly tautological that souls are immortal, but acknowledges a real question of whether human beings have souls, where ancient usage accepted as a near tautology that all living beings have souls, but admitted wide dispute over whether souls are immortal or not."
10.4324/9780415249126-e081-1,Russian philosophy of history,"In his classic book The Russian Idea Nikolai Berdiaev pointed out that ‘independent Russian thought was awakened by the problem of the philosophy of history’. It was because educated, Westernized Russians needed an answer to the problem of Russia’s whence and whither: Who are we? Where are we going? What is Russia’s place in universal history?
         There were many reasons for this passionate search for the meaning of history. It was a means to define Russia’s national identity. It expressed the deeply felt need for modernization, stemming from increasing awareness of the contrast between Russia’s political power and its social backwardness. And – above all, perhaps – it was a result of the disintegration of Russia’s ecclesiastical culture, serving as a substitute for a religious world-view.
         The central place in this secular religion of history was occupied by the notion of progress. It showed a direction, thus answering the ‘cursed question’ of what was to be done; therefore, the nineteenth-century Russian intelligentsia saw the commitment to progress as the most important constitutive part of its self-definition. But many conceptions of progress could also function as a secular theodicy, or rather historiodicy, explaining and justifying the sufferings of the past and present as a necessary price for the triumph of truth and justice in the future. Even more: in a historically retarded country the idea of inevitable stages of development could serve also as a justification for suffering in the immediate future, providing arguments for the view that present individuals, and entire generations, had to sacrifice themselves for the earthly salvation of their descendants. Hence it is understandable that the idea of inevitable, universal progress found in Russia not only enthusiastic advocates but also powerful critics."
10.4324/9780415249126-g007-1,"Legalist philosophy, Chinese","Legalist philosophy constitutes one of the three dominant streams of Chinese philosophy along with Confucian and Daoist philosophies. It aims to establish objective, impartial and impersonal standards for human conduct. It sets forth prescriptive models using such metaphors as the builder’s plumb line and carpenter’s L-square. ‘Modelling after’ implies reshaping and remoulding of human behaviour, not by moral suasion but by the application of fa, a term designating both prescriptive standards and promulgated penal law, designed to achieve public interest.
         The idea of remoulding by punishment and reward is predicated on the Legalist conception of human nature. Innately self-interested human nature underlies human behaviour of liking reward and disliking punishment. Hence, penal law is both natural and an objective prescriptive technique for behavioural control that seeks to harmonize both the individual and the public interest. Penal law is efficacious in so far as it is issued from an authoritative power (shi) based on impersonal, institutionalized position of rulership and borne up, however tacitly, by the support of the people. Shi cannot govern effectively, Legalists argue, without the organizational power of bureaucracy under the centralized control of the ruler. For the ruler, controlling bureaucracy means mastering the technique (shu) of comparing ‘word’ (ming) and actual ‘performance’ (xing), not only through objective mechanisms of empirical verification but also by means of ‘the two handles’ of power over life and death. Hence, the technique holds bureaucracy accountable.
         The Legalist philosophy of governing by fa, shi and shu was in effect a new model for sociopolitical reorganization. It became increasingly popular during the Warring States period, a time of incessant political struggle and of irreversible systemic disintegration of the Zhou feudal order. Legalists called for a radical systemic transformation through this new model in the name of historical relativism: ‘There are as many situations as there are generations… and situations change, so the measures change’ (Han Feizi 49).
         Historical relativism notwithstanding, Legalist philosophy envisages a ‘natural’ and ‘automatic’ polity that, once established, accords with dao (that is, the way the natural world operates spontaneously). The ruler practices ‘non-action’, ‘emptiness’ and ‘quiescence’ so as to embody dao, and thereby personifies objective, impersonal standards over subjective, personal preferences. Once this ‘natural’ polity is established, the ruler does not act while his subordinates act according to xingming accountability as noted above. The ruler does not act as the centre point of the scale does not move, and yet he knows which side is heavy and which side light. In the end, the ruler does not act so that he can act, that is, so he can employ ‘the two handles’ to control his subordinates. This seemingly ‘natural’ and ‘automatic’ polity still requires a ‘sage’ ruler extraordinarily adept at covert statecraft. Only such a ‘sage’ ruler can hope to achieve order, wealth and power for himself and for his people."
10.4324/9780415249126-h006-1,"Islam, concept of philosophy in","There is no generally accepted definition of what Islamic philosophy is, and the term will be used here to mean the sort of philosophy which arose within the culture of Islam. There are several main strands to Islamic philosophy. Peripatetic philosophy follows broadly the Greek tradition, while Sufism uses the principle of mystical knowledge as its leading idea. Some would argue that Islamic philosophy has never lost its concentration on the Qur’an and other significant Muslim texts, and that throughout its history it has sought to understand the essence of the realities both of the Sacred Book and of the created world. The decline of Peripatetic philosophy in the Islamic world did not mean the decline of philosophy as such, which continued to flourish and develop in other forms. Although it is sometimes argued that philosophy is not a proper activity for Muslims, since they already have a perfect guide to action and knowledge in the Qur’an, there are good reasons for thinking that Islamic philosophy is not intrinsically objectionable on religious grounds."
10.4324/9780415249126-h012-1,Political philosophy in classical Islam,"Political philosophy in Islam is the application of Greek political theorizing upon an understanding of Muhammad’s revelation as legislative in intent. In lieu of Aristotle’s Politics, unknown in medieval Islam, Plato’s political philosophy assumed the primary role in an explanation of the nature and purpose of the Islamic state. Al-Farabi conceived of the prophet as a latter day philosopher-king, Ibn Bajja and Ibn Tufayl took their cue from Socrates’ fate and cautioned the philosopher against the possibility of successfully engaging in a philosophical mission to the vulgar masses, and Ibn Rushd presented philosophy as a duty enjoined by the law upon those able to philosophize."
10.4324/9780415249126-h019-1,Epistemology in Islamic philosophy,"Muslim philosophers agree that knowledge is possible. Knowledge is the intellect’s grasp of the immaterial forms, the pure essences or universals that constitute the natures of things, and human happiness is achieved only through the intellect’s grasp of such universals. They stress that for knowledge of the immaterial forms, the human intellect generally relies on the senses. Some philosophers, such as Ibn Rushd and occasionally Ibn Sina, assert that it is the material forms themselves, which the senses provide, that are grasped by the intellect after being stripped of their materiality with the help of the divine world. However, the general view as expressed by al-Farabi and Ibn Sina seems to be that the material forms only prepare the way for the reception of the immaterial forms, which are then provided by the divine world. They also state that on rare occasions the divine world simply bestows the immaterial forms on the human intellect without any help from the senses. This occurrence is known as prophecy. While all Muslim philosophers agree that grasping eternal entities ensures happiness, they differ as to whether such grasping is also necessary for eternal existence."
10.4324/9780415249126-f001-1,"Buddhist philosophy, Indian","Buddhism was an important ingredient in the philosophical melange of the Indian subcontinent for over a millennium. From an inconspicuous beginning a few centuries before Christ, Buddhist scholasticism gained in strength until it reached a peak of influence and originality in the latter half of the first millennium. Beginning in the eleventh century, Buddhism gradually declined and eventually disappeared from northern India. Although different individual thinkers placed emphasis on different issues, the tendency was for most writers to offer an integrated philosophical system that incorporated ethics, epistemology and metaphysics. Most of the issues addressed by Buddhist philosophers in India stem directly from the teachings attributed to Siddhārtha Gautama, known better through his honorific title, the Buddha.
         The central concern of the Buddha was the elimination of unnecessary discontent. His principal insight into this problem was that all dissatisfaction arises because people (and other forms of life as well) foster desires and aversions, which are in turn the consequence of certain misunderstandings about their identity. Discontent can be understood as frustration, or a failure to achieve what one wishes; if one’s wishes are generally unrealistic and therefore unattainable, then one will naturally be generally dissatisfied. Since the Buddha saw human frustration as an effect of misunderstandings concerning human nature, it was natural for Buddhist philosophers to attend to questions concerning the true nature of a human being. Since the Buddha himself was held as the paradigm of moral excellence, it was also left to later philosophers to determine what kind of being the Buddha had been. A typical question was whether his example was one that ordinary people could hope to follow, or whether his role was in some way more than that of a teacher who showed other people how to improve themselves.
         The Buddha offered criticisms of many views on human nature and virtue and duty held by the teachers of his age. Several of the views that he opposed were based, at least indirectly, on notions incorporated in the Veda, a body of liturgical literature used by the Brahmans in the performance of rituals. Later generations of Buddhists spent much energy in criticizing Brahmanical claims of the supremacy of the Veda; at the same time, Buddhists tended to place their confidence in a combination of experience and reason. The interest in arriving at correct understanding through correct methods of reasoning led to a preoccupation with questions of logic and epistemology, which tended to overshadow all other philosophical concerns during the last five centuries during which Buddhism was an important factor in Indian philosophy.
         Since the Buddha saw human frustration as an effect that could be eliminated if its cause were eliminated, it was natural for Buddhist philosophers to focus their attention on a variety of questions concerning causality. How many kinds of cause are there? Can a multiplicity of effects have a single cause? Can a single thing have a multiplicity of causes? How is a potentiality triggered into an actuality? Questions concerning simplicity and complexity, or unity and plurality, figured prominently in Buddhist discussions of what kinds of things in the world are ultimately real. In a tradition that emphasized the principle that all unnecessary human pain and conflict can ultimately be traced to a failure to understand what things in the world are real, it was natural to seek criteria by which one discerns real things from fictions."
10.4324/9780415249126-f003-1,Tibetan philosophy,"Tibetan philosophy – if we can make a rough separation between what is predominantly argument-oriented and analytical and what is more a question of ritual, devotion or vision – is best characterized as a form of scholasticism. It exhibits marked parallels with philosophy in Western medieval contexts, including a heavy emphasis on logic, philosophy of language and metaphysics, all in the service of exegesis of religious doctrine found in root texts. Just as in Western scholasticism, there is a reliance upon scripture, but within that traditional context there is also ample room for rational analysis and synthesis of potentially disparate doctrines, as well as a considerable quantity of argumentation which is a type of ‘fine tuning’ of Indian issues. Tibetan thinkers explored matters which are often of genuine importance in our understanding of Indian texts. In particular, in Mādhyamika Buddhist philosophy we find an important synthesis of Indian Yogācāra ideas with a relatively natural interpretation of key ideas in the literature on the Buddha-nature (tathāgatagarbha); we also find important debates on the nature of the two truths, the status of means of valid cognition (pramāṇas), and on questions of philosophical method, such as the possibility or impossibility of Mādhyamikas holding theses and themselves defending positions. Beginning with the Great Debate of bSam-yas (Samyay) in the latter part of the eighth century, we find constantly recurring reflection on questions concerning the nature of spiritual realizations and the role of conceptual and analytic thought in leading to such insights. In the logico-epistemological literature, the hotly debated issues generally centre around the problem of universals, the Indian Buddhist philosophy of language and the theory of the triply characterized logical reason (trirūpahetu). In addition, the Tibetans developed an elaborate logic of debate, an indigenous system containing many original elements unknown in or even alien to Indian Buddhist logic."
10.4324/0123456789-da087-1,"Causation, in modern philosophy","The new science of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries sparked intense reflection and theorizing on the nature of causation. Philosophers attempted to account for the nature of causation in a way that would satisfy the demands of metaphysics, theology and science. Against the Aristotelian tradition, Descartes defends a view of the nature of matter as essentially inactive, thus obviating the metaphysical problem of the nature of change. Interactionism emerges as a scientifically attractive position, but it seems to violate some fundamental tenets of Cartesian metaphysics. Occasionalism, the metaphysical doctrine according to which God is the only cause of change, seems appealing on religious/theological grounds but raises difficult questions about our relation to the natural world and thus about the nature of science.
         Occasionalism, however, seems inevitable once Malebranche powerfully argues that necessary connection is the most essential element of the concept of causation. The element of necessary connection makes it logically impossible for the effect to fail to follow from the cause. Only God’s will satisfies the requirement that the effect cannot fail to follow from the cause without contradiction. Thus God is the only true cause of everything.
         While mounting powerful criticisms of both occasionalism and interactionism, Hume manages to include necessary connection in at least one of his definitions of cause. For Hume, our idea of necessary connection originates in an impression of reflection or a determination of thought prompted by our experience of constant conjunctions. Our causal inferences are the products of habit and the imagination, rather than reason.
         Unlike most modern philosophers, Leibniz defends a view of created substances as essentially active and ascribes a central role to final causation. Leibniz’s doctrine of pre-established harmony endows each created substance with the capacity of change, but denies the possibility of genuine interaction between substances.
         Kant rejects Leibnizian pre-established harmony, which he conceives as rendering causation merely ideal, and argues in favour of a Newtonian interactionist model: a spatio-temporal world of material substances that causally interact with one another. Against Hume, Kant defends the concept of cause as a pure concept of the understanding that can be rightfully applied to the objects of experience. Indeed, Kant argues that without the concept of cause we could not have any experiences whatsoever.
         Women philosophers were also part of the philosophical debates concerning causation in the modern period, mounting powerful arguments against the most established positions. Cavendish attacks interactionism, arguing that motion cannot transfer from one body to another. Astell criticizes occasionalism on the grounds that it renders God a poor craftsman who acts in vain by creating bodies which do not play any role whatsoever. Shepherd levels some strong objections against Hume’s imagination-based account of causation and she insists on the role of reason in achieving knowledge of causation."
10.4324/9780415249126-g006-1,Daoist philosophy,"Early Daoist philosophy has had an incalculable influence on the development of Chinese philosophy and culture. Philosophical Daoism is often called ‘Lao–Zhuang’ philosophy, referring directly to the two central and most influential texts, the Daodejing (or Laozi) and the Zhuangzi, both of which were composite, probably compiled in the fourth and third centuries bc. Beyond these two texts we might include the syncretic Huainanzi (circa 140 bc) and the Liezi, reconstituted around the fourth century ad, as part of the traditional Daoist corpus.
         Second in influence only to the Confucian school, the classical Daoist philosophers in many ways have been construed as both a critique on and a complement to the more conservative, regulatory precepts of their Confucian rivals. Daoism has frequently and unfortunately been characterized in terms of passivity, femininity, quietism and spirituality, a doctrine embraced by artists, recluses and religious mystics. Confucianism, by contrast, has been cast in the language of moral precepts, virtues, imperial edicts and regulative methods, a doctrine embodied in and administered by the state official. The injudicious application of this yin–yang-like concept to Daoism and Confucianism tends to impoverish our appreciation of the richness and complexity of these two traditions. Used in a heavy-handed way, it obfuscates the fundamental wholeness of both the Confucian and Daoist visions of meaningful human existence by imposing an unwarranted conservatism on classical Confucianism, and an unjustified radicalism on Daoism.
         There is a common ground shared by the teachings of classical Confucianism and Daoism in the advocacy of self-cultivation. In general terms, both traditions treat life as an art rather than a science. Both express a ‘this-wordly’ concern for the concrete details of immediate existence rather than exercising their minds in the service of grand abstractions and ideals. Both acknowledge the uniqueness, importance and primacy of the particular person and the person’s contribution to the world, while at the same time stressing the ecological interrelatedness and interdependence of this person with their context.
         However, there are also important differences. For the Daoists, the Confucian penchant for reading the ‘constant dao’ myopically as the ‘human dao’ is to experience the world at a level that generates a dichotomy between the human and natural worlds. The argument against the Confucian seems to be that the Confucians do not take the ecological sensitivity far enough, defining self-cultivation in purely human terms. It is the focused concern for the overcoming of discreteness by a spiritual extension and integration in the human world that gives classical Confucianism its sociopolitical and practical orientation. But from the Daoist perspective, ‘overcoming discreteness’ is not simply the redefinition of the limits of one’s concerns and responsibilities within the confines of the human sphere. The Daoists reject the notion that human experience occurs in a vacuum, and that the whole process of existence can be reduced to human values and purposes.
         To the extent that Daoism is prescriptive, it is so not by articulating rules to follow or asserting the existence of some underlying moral principle, but by describing the conduct of an achieved human being – the sage (shengren) or the Authentic Person (zhenren) – as a recommended object of emulation. The model for this human ideal, in turn, is the orderly, elegant and harmonious processes of nature. Throughout the philosophical Daoist corpus, there is a ‘grand’ analogy established in the shared vocabulary used to describe the conduct of the achieved human being on the one hand, and the harmony achieved in the mutual accomodations of natural phenomena on the other.
         The perceived order is an achievement, not a given. Because dao is an emergent, ‘bottom-up’ order rather than something imposed, the question is: what is the optimal relationship between de and dao, between a particular and its environing conditions? The Daoist response is the self-dispositioning of particulars into relationships which allow the fullest degree of self-disclosure and development. In the Daoist literature, this kind of optimally appropriate action is often described as wuwei, ‘not acting wilfully’, ‘acting naturally’ or ‘non-assertive activity’. Wuwei, then, is the negation of that kind of ‘making’ or ‘doing’ which requires that a particular sacrifice its own integrity in acting on behalf of something ‘other’, a negation of that kind of engagement that makes something false to itself. Wuwei activity ‘characterizes’ – that is, produces the character or ethos of – an aesthetically contrived composition. There is no ideal, no closed perfectedness. Ongoing creative achievement itself provides novel possibilities for a richer creativity. Wuwei activity is thus fundamentally qualitative: an aesthetic category and, only derivatively, an ethical one. Wuwei can be evaluated on aesthetic grounds, allowing that some relationships are more productively wuwei than others. Some relationships are more successful than others in maximizing the creative possibilities of oneself in one’s environments.
         This classical Daoist aesthetic, while articulated in these early texts with inimitable flavour and imagination, was, like most philosophical anarchisms, too intangible and impractical to ever be a serious contender as a formal structure for social and political order. In the early years of the Han dynasty (206bc–ad 220), there was an attempt in the Huainanzi to encourage the Daoist sense of ethos by tempering the lofty ideals with a functional practicality. It appropriates a syncretic political framework as a compromise for promoting a kind of practicable Daoism – an anarchism within expedient bounds. While historically the Huainanzi fell on deaf ears, it helped to set a pattern for the Daoist contribution to Chinese culture across the sweep of history. Over and over again, in the currency of anecdote and metaphor, identifiably Daoist sensibilities would be expressed through a range of theoretical structures and social grammars, from military strategies, to the dialectical progress of distinctively Chinese schools of Buddhism, to the constantly changing face of poetics and art. It can certainly be argued that the richest models of Confucianism, represented as the convergence of Daoism, Buddhism and Confucianism itself, were an attempt to integrate Confucian concerns with human community with the broader Daoist commitment to an ecologically sensitive humanity."
10.4324/9780415249126-g013-1,Law and ritual in Chinese philosophy,"The contrast between li, conventionally translated as ‘rites’ or ‘rituals’, and fa, conventionally translated as ‘law’, marks a distinction in Chinese political theory as to the nature of political order and the preferred means of achieving such order. Lizhi, traditionally associated with Confucianism, refers to political order predicated on and achieved primarily by reference to the li or ‘rites’, that is, traditional customs, mores and norms. In contrast, fazhi, associated with Legalism, refers to political order attained primarily through reliance on fa or ‘laws’, that is, publicly promulgated, codified standards of general applicability backed up by the coercive power of the state.
         The tension between these two dominant strategies for achieving social and political order – lizhi and fazhi – is a theme that began in the classical tradition and has persisted down to the present day, even though the understanding of li and fa and the relation between them has changed and evolved over the years. For example, some thinkers saw li as context-specific, flexible norms or standards of a particular culture. Others saw li as more permanent, general standards. Some objected to the codification of li and fa; others favoured it. Some saw li and fa as interdependent, equally important and mutually reinforcing; others relied predominantly on one to the detriment, if not total exclusion, of the other.
         Accordingly, it is not possible to speak of a single conception of li (lizhi) or fa (fazhi). Nevertheless, one must extract or highlight certain general or dominant features that tend to characterize lizhi and fazhi and to distinguish the one from the other, if one is to make use of this important contrast as a hermeneutical tool for interpreting, explaining and understanding a central debate in Chinese political philosophy. In reflecting on the importance of the lizhi versus fazhi distinction, five salient points emerge.
         First, advocates of lizhi have tended to favour less formal means of conflict resolution than advocates of fazhi. The former believe that informal methods foster more particularized justice; the latter believe such methods provide excessive discretionary authority to those in power and thus foster abuse. Accordingly, publicly promulgated rules or laws are necessary.
         Second, and a corollary to the first, fa or ‘laws’ are more formal norms of greater general applicability than the li, which in most instances consist of the web of informal context- and culture-specific rules that provide guidance for appropriate civil interaction in daily life among the various members of a certain community. Fazhi, therefore, is more of an externally imposed order that requires of the individual compliance more than participation. In contrast, lizhi proponents view order as emerging out of a particular context, a particular community of people. Society is what those who comprise it choose and make it to be. Participation rather than mere compliance is central.
         Third, and again a corollary, lizhi and fazhi mark a contrast in the goals and aspirations of society. Advocates of lizhi tend to be more optimistic about human kind and the possibility of achieving a harmonious social order in which each person is able to find their place and play their chosen role. They tend to see society, social order, humanity, as an achievement. If human beings are willing to put aside narrowly selfish and provincial concerns, if they are willing to defer to the excellence of others and to cooperate in the project of creating a harmonious social order in which each has a place, then such an order is possible. In the process, one becomes a better person. Put differently, one’s potential for individual and personal growth is inextricably bound up with the fate of society.
         In contrast, many of the fazhi persuasion take a dimmer view of human nature. Humans are by and large self-interested beings. Left to their own devices, the strong will exploit the weak; the powerful will abuse the powerless. Impartial rules are necessary to limit what one person can do to another. Laws provide this minimum layer of protection, this floor below which society cannot sink and remain a peaceful, and arguably just, society. Of course law may play a more positive role as well; recourse to general laws may simply be an efficient way to ensure an equitable distribution of social resources, for example. At the end of the day, however, advocates of fazhi have been primarily concerned with the use of fa as a corrective to the abuses and weaknesses of li. Thus law’s role in ensuring a minimal floor of protection, a base equality, has been underscored, explaining in part the rather negative image of law in China through the ages. In contrast, the positive side of law, the empowering aspect of rights, the ability to use law as a vehicle for social change, has been central to many Westerners’ conception of law.
         Fourth, as might perhaps be expected, there has been no clear victor in the lizhi versus fazhi controversy. No system is perfect; no one has yet achieved the perfect means for realizing social order. Many of the same issues confront every society: how to achieve fairness and justice for all while at the same time recognizing the uniqueness of each person and each situation, and thereby achieve justice for each; how to provide those in power the necessary discretionary authority to mete out a particularized justice without falling prey to personal prejudice, bias, corruption and abuse; how to ensure that individuals have sufficient rights to shield themselves against each other and the state, and yet simultaneously encourage people not to wield those rights as weapons in endless litigation aimed at maximizing one’s own personal interests to the detriment of society’s interests; how to ensure that law will be a tool of the disempowered to effect social change and not simply a tool for exploitation and legitimation by those in power; how to implement a formal rule of law with institutional integrity and independence, overseen by professionals, and yet prevent the institution from becoming overly bureaucratic and law the esoteric province of the professional lawyer. The li versus fa distinction, although not a perfect fit, is useful as a way to organize Chinese thinking on, and approaches to, these and similar issues.
         A fifth and final introductory point is that both lizhi and fazhi, as they have developed in China, have failed in two important respects. First, they have failed to provide effective restraints on the power of the ruler, especially institutional restraints. Second, they have failed to adequately address the need to protect the individual against the state. Again, this failure is largely institutional, although like the failure to adequately restrain the power of the ruler, it can also be traced back to certain underlying philosophical assumptions common to both the lizhi and fazhi traditions. These assumptions include the rejection of three key assumptions of the western liberal tradition: (1) that someone to treat someone with respect and as one’s equal requires that one refrain from imposing one’s view on them (the normative equality premise); (2) that each person knows what is best for themselves and/or people reasonably disagree about what constitutes the good (the epistemic equality premise); and (3) that the interests of the individual and state may not be, and arguably are not, reconcilable."
10.4324/9780415249126-g103-1,"Confucian philosophy, Japanese","Confucian philosophy is said to have arrived in Japan as early as the third century ad, but it did not become a subject of meaningful scholarly inquiry until the seventh century. The ‘Confucianism’ to which Japanese elites and scholars were first attracted represented fields of knowledge concerned more with ontology and divination than with social ethics and politics. Because of the priority given to birth over talent in official appointments, Confucianism in Japan remained more a gentlemanly accomplishment and never approached the status it had in China, where mastery of its teachings represented a gateway to officialdom. Intellectually, Confucian philosophy was overshadowed both in Japan and on the continent at this time by the teachings of Buddhism, which provided answers both to spiritual and metaphysical concerns.
         Confucianism in China was refashioned in the eleventh and twelfth centuries by a number of scholars, of whom Zhu Xi was the most prominent. He revised the curriculum, restored social and ethical concerns to positions of centrality within the tradition and formulated a new rationalistic ontology. His teachings won a broad following among intellectuals in China and eventually earned the government’s endorsement as the official interpretation for China’s examination system.
         From the seventeenth century onwards, Zhu Xi’s teachings reached a comparably distinguished position within scholarly circles in Japan, though the government’s endorsement of the Hayashi family as official interpreters of Zhu Xi’s teachings was the limit of the official authorization of that philosophy in Japan. Though the idealistic Wang Yangming school challenged Zhu Xi’s teachings in Japan as it had in China, the more effective challenge was mounted by the classicist teachings known as Ancient Studies. These scholars, of whom the best known was Ogyū Sorai, sought the ‘true message of the sages’ by emphasizing direct study of the ancient core texts of Confucianism rather than the exegesis on those classics by Zhu Xi and others.
         Confucian philosophy contributed to the rationalism, humanism, ethnocentrism and ‘historical mindedness’ of Tokugawa Japan. The teachings were also responsible for changing fundamental ontological and epistemological assumptions, while also opening intellectual circles to unprecedented pluralism and diversity. Towards the end of the Tokugawa period in the mid-nineteenth century, Confucian philosophy (particularly in the variety fashioned by Wang Yangming) also provided inspiration and justification for those activist reformers who succeeded in overthrowing the old order.
         During the modern period, Confucian philosophy has been identified with the Tokugawa tradition which has been at times idealized and and at other times vilified. Nonetheless, a number of the assumptions central to Confucian philosophy continue to characterize much popular and intellectual thought in contemporary Japan, as well as those ethics that tend to be most admired, even though actual knowledge of Confucian philosophy does not appear to be widespread any longer in Japan."
10.4324/9780415249126-h001-1,Platonism in Islamic philosophy,"Plato seems to have been more an icon and an inspiration than an authentic source for Islamic philosophers. So far as is known, the only works available to them in Arabic translation were the Laws, the Sophist, the Timaeus and the Republic. His name was often invoked as a sage and an exemplar of that wisdom available to humankind among the Greeks before the revelation of the Qur’an. This in itself could represent a kind of affront to orthodox Islam, which tended to view the human situation before the Qur’an’s ‘coming down’ as one of pervasive ignorance (jahaliyya). However, the rise of humanist culture in Baghdad during the ninth and tenth centuries ad, which involved Syriac Christian translators, presupposed a gradual acceptance of Greek wisdom in which Plato figured paradigmatically, even though far fewer of his works were made available in translation than those of Aristotle."
10.4324/9780415249126-h008-1,"Islamic philosophy, modern","There are a number of major trends in modern Islamic philosophy. First, there is the challenge of the West to traditional Islamic philosophical and cultural principles and the desire to establish a form of thought which is distinctive. From the mid-nineteenth century onwards, Islamic philosophers have attempted to redefine Islamic philosophy; some, such as Hasan Hanafi and Ali Mazrui, have sought to give modern Islamic philosophy a global significance and provide an agenda for world unity.
         Second, there is a continuing tradition of interest in illuminationist and mystical thought, especially in Iran where the influence of Mulla Sadra and al-Suhrawardi has remained strong. The influence of the latter can be seen in the works of Henry Corbin and Seyyed Hossein Nasr; Mulla Sadra has exercised an influence over figures such as Mahdi Ha’iri Yazdi and the members of Qom School, notably Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The philosopher Abdul Soroush has introduced a number of concepts from Western philosophy into Iran.
         Finally, there have been many thinkers who have adapted and employed philosophical ideas which are originally non-Islamic as part of the normal philosophical process of seeking to understand conceptual problems. This is a particularly active area, with a number of philosophers from many parts of the Islamic world investigating the relevance to Islam of concepts such as Hegelianism and existentialism. At the same time, mystical philosophy continues to exercise an important influence. Modern Islamic philosophy is thus quite diverse, employing a wide variety of techniques and approaches to its subject."
10.4324/9780415249126-h015-1,"Law, Islamic philosophy of","One of the principles of Islam which precedes juristic discussion proper is that God, the creator and lord of the world, has commissioned humanity to believe, confess and act in particular ways. The details of this commission (taklif) were handed down through a sequence of prophets, culminating in Muhammad, and were then embedded in two literary structures which together constitute revelation (wahy): the Qur’an, which is the word of God, and the hadith, short narratives of the prophet’s life and sayings which give expression to his (and his community’s) ideal practice or sunna. The totality of beliefs and rules that can be derived from these sources constitutes God’s law or shari‘a.
         Juristic literature has generated two major literary genres. One, known as usul al-fiqh (roots of jurisprudence), deals with hermeneutical principles that can be used for deriving rules from revelation; it represents, in part, something like a philosophy of law. The other, dominant genre, furu’ al-fiqh (branches of jurisprudence), is an elaboration of rules which govern ritual and social activities. An overall philosophy of law in Islam, not fully articulated in the pre-modern tradition, can only be discovered through consideration of both genres."
10.4324/9780415249126-h054-1,Illuminationist philosophy,"Illuminationist philosophy started in twelfth-century Persia, and has been an important force in Islamic, especially Persian, philosophy right up to the present day. It presents a critique of some of the leading ideas of Aristotelianism, as represented by the philosophy of Ibn Sina (Avicenna), and argues that many of the distinctions which are crucial to the character of that form of philosophy are misguided. Illuminationists develop a view of reality in accordance with which essence is more important than existence, and intuitive knowledge is more significant than scientific knowledge. They use the notion of light, as the name suggests, as a way of exploring the links between God, the Light of Lights, and his creation. The result is a view of the whole of reality as a continuum, with the physical world being an aspect of the divine. This sort of language proved to be very suggestive for mystical philosophers, and Illuminationism quickly became identified with Islamic mysticism."
10.4324/9780415249126-j047-1,"Jewish philosophy, contemporary","Jewish philosophy is pursued by committed Jews seeking to understand Judaism and the world in one another’s light. In this broad sense, contemporary Jewish philosophy maintains the central focus of classical, medieval and Enlightenment Jewish philosophy. But a certain kind of traditionalism distinguishes many contemporary Jewish philosophers from their predecessors: an effort to show how Judaism maintains continuity and coherence despite historical change. Jewish thinkers who are traditionalists in this sense are no longer preoccupied with showing non-Jewish philosophers how Judaism fares when evaluated by universal reason, as their classical, medieval and modern predecessors were. Nor is their chief concern with exhibiting the good reasons for remaining Jewish and not converting to Christianity or Islam, as was that of many earlier Jewish thinkers. One work that sets an agenda for many of these traditionalists is Franz Rosenzweig’s Der Stern der Erlösung (The Star of Redemption) (1921). Like Rosenzweig, (1) they often reject the Enlightenment demand for a transcendental propaedeutic as a prelude to asking substantive questions. Instead, they address Jewish thought, ethics and experience head on. (2) None among this group thinks of his work as beholden primarily and inevitably to standards of thought articulated first and foremost outside distinctively Jewish experience. (3) The six points of Der Stern der Erlösung (The Star of Redemption) – Creation, Revelation, Redemption, God, Israel, and the World – mark the large themes they aim to define or the categories through which they propose, explore and defend their claims. Besides traditionalism thus understood, contemporary Jewish philosophy, particularly among philosophers with analytic training, is marked by efforts philosophically to reanimate the classic texts of medieval Jewish philosophy, especially the work of Moses Maimonides."
10.4324/9780415249126-s031-1,"International relations, philosophy of","The philosophy of international relations – or more precisely its political philosophy – embraces problems about morality in diplomacy and war, the justice of international practices and institutions bearing on economic welfare and the global environment, human rights, and the relationship between sectional loyalties such as patriotism and global moral commitments.
         Not everyone believes that such a subject can exist, or rather, that it can have significant ethical content. According to political realism – a widely-held view among Anglo-American students of international relations – moral considerations have no place in decisions about foreign affairs and international behaviour. The most extreme varieties of realism deny that moral judgment can have meaning or force in international affairs; more moderate versions acknowledge the meaningfulness of such judgments but hold either that leaders have no responsibility to attend to the morality of their actions in foreign affairs (because their overriding responsibility is to advance the interests of their constituents), or that the direct pursuit of moral goals in international relations is likely to be self-defeating.
         Leaving aside the more sceptical kinds of political realism, the most influential orientations to substantive international morality can be arrayed on a continuum. Distinctions are made on the basis of the degree of privilege, if any, extended to the citizens of a state to act on their own behalf at the potential expense of the liberty and wellbeing of persons elsewhere. ‘The morality of states’, at one extreme, holds that states have rights of autonomy analogous to those of individuals within domestic society, which secure them against external interference in their internal affairs and guarantee their ownership and control of the natural and human resources within their borders. At the other end of the continuum, one finds cosmopolitan views which deny that states enjoy any special privilege; these views hold that individuals rather than states are the ultimate subjects of morality, and that value judgments concerning international conduct should take equally seriously the wellbeing of each person potentially affected by a decision, whether compatriot or foreigner. Cosmopolitan views may acknowledge that states (and similar entities) have morally significant features, but analysis of the significance of these features must connect them with considerations of individual wellbeing. Intermediate views are possible; for example, a conception of the privileged character of the state can be combined with a conception of the international realm as weakly normative (that is, governed by principles which demand that states adhere to minimum conditions of peaceful coexistence).
         The theoretical difference between the morality of states and a fully cosmopolitan morality is reflected in practical differences about the justifiability of intervention in the internal affairs of other states, the basis and content of human rights, and the extent, if any, of our obligations as individuals and as citizens of states to help redress the welfare effects of international inequalities."
10.4324/9780415249126-s044-1,"Political philosophy, nature of","Political philosophy developed as a central aspect of philosophy generally in the world of ancient Greece, and the writings of Plato and Aristotle made a basic and still important contribution to the subject. Central to political philosophy has been a concern with the justification or criticism of general political arrangements such as democracy, oligarchy or kingship, and with the ways in which the sovereignty of the state is to be understood; with the relationship between the individual and the political order, and the nature of the individual’s obligation to that order; with the coherence and identity of the political order from the point of view of the nation and groups within the nation, and with the role of culture, language and race as aspects of this; with the basis of different general political ideologies and standpoints such as conservatism, socialism and liberalism; and with the nature of the basic concepts such as state, individual, rights, community and justice in terms of which we understand and argue about politics. Because it is concerned with the justification and criticism of existing and possible forms of political organization a good deal of political philosophy is normative; it seeks to provide grounds for one particular conception of the right and the good in politics. In consequence many current controversies in political philosophy are methodological; they have to do with how (if at all) normative judgments about politics can be justified."
10.4324/9780415249126-t070-1,"International law, philosophy of","The philosophy of international law has a long history, reaching back on some accounts beyond the Medieval period to late Hellenistic philosophy. In the twentieth century work in this field was limited, at least among analytic philosophers. From the late 1970s onward, a rich literature developed on global justice, human rights, just war theory, and other key issues of direct relevance to the philosophy of international law, but for the most part it did not directly engage international law or international legal institutions. Quite recently, interest in the philosophy of international law has re-awakened.
         The questions the philosophy of international law tries to answer may be divided into two categories: international jurisprudence and the morality of international law. The first includes: (a) is what we call international law really law and if so what makes a norm an international law (as distinct from, say, a political or social norm) and (b) how do we know whether a norm is an international law? International jurisprudence explores fundamental conceptual and epistemic questions about international law, typically with an eye toward determining how and to what extent international law differs from domestic (national) law. The second category encompasses the reasoned moral evaluation of existing international law and legal institutions and principled proposals for reforming them."

Reductionists seek to integrate the mind and mental phenomena – fear, pain, anger and the like – with the natural world by showing them to be natural phenomena. Their inspirations are the famous reductions of science: of the heat of gases to molecular motion, of lightning to electric discharge, of the gene to the DNA molecule and the like. Reductionists hope to show a similar relationship between mental kinds and neurophysiological kinds."
10.4324/9780415249126-n014-1,"Education, history of philosophy of","The philosophy of education may be considered a branch of practical philosophy, aimed ultimately at the guidance of an important aspect of human affairs. Its questions thus arise more or less directly from the features of educational practice and the role of education in the promotion of individual and social wellbeing, however much its answers may be conditioned by the larger philosophical and historical settings in which they are posed. Philosophers have concerned themselves with what the aims of education should be, and through what forms of instruction, inquiry and practice those aims might be attained. This demands attention to the contents of instruction and who shall have authority over it. It demands attention to the nature of instruction itself, its epistemic dimensions and what is entailed by its reliance on language; the nature of learning and human development, both moral and intellectual; and how all of these are interrelated. The philosophy of education thus stands at the intersection of moral and political philosophy, epistemology, and the philosophy of mind and language, as they bear on the foundations of educational practice.
         The philosophy of education began in classical antiquity with the challenges posed by Socrates to the educational claims of the sophists. Plato and Aristotle developed systematic theories of education guided by an ethic of justice and self-restraint, and by the goal of promoting social harmony and the happiness or wellbeing of all citizens. The Stoic descendants of Socrates were expelled from Rome and the oratorical model of higher education given official sanction, but Augustine re-established the philosophical model through a synthesis of Platonism and Christianity, and in his mature educational thought brought elements of the oratorical and Platonic models together in his account of the Christian teacher’s training.
         The religious wars of the Reformation inspired several philosophical stances toward the relationships of Church, state, school and conscience. Hobbes argued for a consolidation of ecclesiastical and civil authority, with full sovereign authority over education; Locke for liberty, religious toleration, and private education aiming at self-governance in accordance with reason; and Rousseau not just for the free development and exercise of the full array of human faculties, but for the establishment of a civic religion limited to the core of shared Christian beliefs which Enlightenment figures from Descartes onward had thought evident to natural reason.
         The Enlightenment’s embrace of science and reason yielded efforts towards the development of a science of learning and pedagogy in the nineteenth century, but Rousseau’s romantic reaction to it and defence of democracy were also powerful influences. In the twentieth century, Dewey produced a new synthesis of Enlightenment and Rousseauian themes, drawing on Hegel, the experimentalism of Mill, evolutionary theory and psychology, and aspects of the substance and intent of Rousseau’s pedagogy."
10.4324/9780415249126-n054-1,"Sport, philosophy of","The philosophy of sport as a separate area of philosophy is largely a phenomenon of the second half of the twentieth century, although previous philosophers, back to the ancient Greeks, occasionally made reference to sport or used it as an example in a larger point. Within the philosophy of sport, a number of sub-areas have emerged as important: sport and ethics, questions concerning sport and society, the issue of self-knowledge in sport, the mind–body problem as it relates to sport, sport and art, and the controversy over the possibility of defining certain key terms within sport, such as sport, game, play and athletics.
         Within the area of sport and society, several major debates have arisen. The first is about whether sport teaches values and, if so, whether the values taught are desirable or not. Second, considerable attention has been paid to how certain societal problems, such as sexism and racism, have manifested themselves in sport, and how they might be addressed within sport. Third, attention has been directed to the phenomenon of the athlete as cultural hero.
         The relevance to sport of the age-old philosophical issue of self-knowledge is manifest, with a number of different construals of what counts as self-knowledge emerging as important. Attention has been paid to self-knowledge in the psychological sense, self-knowledge as manifested in Zen thought and self-knowledge in the Socratic sense, among others. The mind–body problem, also an old philosophic issue, has clear relevance within the domain of sport. Dualism, physicalism and phenomenological accounts have all been represented, the latter being the most dominant and persuasive so far."
10.4324/9780415249126-l094-1,"Sexuality, philosophy of","The philosophy of sexuality, like the philosophy of science, art or law, is the study of the concepts and propositions surrounding its central protagonist, in this case ‘sex’. Its practitioners focus on conceptual, metaphysical and normative questions.
         Conceptual philosophy of sex analyses the notions of sexual desire, sexual activity and sexual pleasure. What makes a feeling a sexual sensation? Manipulation of and feelings in the genitals are not necessary, since other body parts yield sexual pleasure. What makes an act sexual? A touch on the arm might be a friendly pat, an assault, or sex; physical properties alone do not distinguish them. What is the conceptual link between sexual pleasure and sexual activity? Neither the intention to produce sexual pleasure nor the actual experience of pleasure seems necessary for an act to be sexual. Other conceptual questions have to do not with what makes an act sexual, but with what makes it the type of sexual act it is. How should ‘rape’ be defined? What the conceptual differences are, if any, between obtaining sex through physical force and obtaining it by offering money is an interesting and important issue.
         Metaphysical philosophy of sex discusses ontological and epistemological matters: the place of sexuality in human nature; the relationships among sexuality, emotion and cognition; the meaning of sexuality for the person, the species, the cosmos. What is sex all about, anyway? That sexual desire is a hormone-driven instinct implanted by a god or nature acting in the service of the species, and that it has a profound spiritual dimension, are two – not necessarily incompatible – views. Perhaps the significance of sexuality is little different from that of eating, breathing and defecating; maybe, or in addition, sexuality is partially constitutive of moral personality.
         Normative philosophy of sex explores the perennial questions of sexual ethics. In what circumstances is it morally permissible to engage in sexual activity or experience sexual pleasure? With whom? For what purpose? With which body parts? For how long? The historically central answers come from Thomist natural law, Kantian deontology, and utilitarianism. Normative philosophy of sex also addresses legal, social and political issues. Should society steer people in the direction of heterosexuality, marriage, family? May the law regulate sexual conduct by prohibiting prostitution or homosexuality? Normative philosophy of sex includes nonethical value questions as well. What is good sex? What is its contribution to the good life?
         The breadth of the philosophy of sex is shown by the variety of topics it investigates: abortion, contraception, acquaintance rape, pornography, sexual harassment, and objectification, to name a few. The philosophy of sex begins with a picture of a privileged pattern of relationship, in which two adult heterosexuals love each other, are faithful to each other within a formal marriage, and look forward to procreation and family. Philosophy of sex, as the Socratic scrutiny of our sexual practices, beliefs and concepts, challenges this privileged pattern by exploring the virtues, and not only the vices, of adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, group sex, bestiality, masturbation, sadomasochism, incest, paedophilia and casual sex with anonymous strangers. Doing so provides the same illumination about sex that is provided when the philosophies of science, art and law probe the privileged pictures of their own domains."
10.4324/9780415249126-n051-1,"Scandinavia, philosophy in","The three countries of Scandinavia – Sweden, Denmark and Norway – share much of their history and culture with Finland and Iceland, and it is natural to treat all five Nordic countries together in any philosophical survey. The first universities in this region were founded more than 500 years ago, in Sweden at Uppsala in 1477, and in Copenhagen, the Danish capital, two years later. Over the years, the main trends of philosophical thought, from Descartes and Locke to Hegelianism, existentialism and logical positivism have all impinged upon philosophy in these countries. A unique feature of philosophy in Norway and Iceland, and until 1971 also in Denmark, is that all university students, including students in law, medicine and dentistry, spend all or most of their first semester preparing for a compulsory exam in philosophy which comprises some philosophy of science and philosophy of language, and some history of philosophy and history of science. This requirement has meant much for recruiting and employment opportunities for philosophers. Thus, for example, the University of Oslo has sixty-five tenured philosophers, while Denmark has suffered a dramatic reduction in the number of philosophical positions since the requirement was abolished. In Sweden philosophy is a compulsory subject in some branches of study in secondary schools.
         That philosophers from the Nordic countries have gained a reputation for broad interests and familiarity with several philosophical traditions may largely be due to two factors: small countries increase the likelihood that they will get involved in popularization and public affairs, and small language communities induce the learning of other languages, notably English, German and French, which makes developments in other countries more accessible."
10.4324/9780415249126-p063-1,Experimental philosophy,"Experimental philosophy is not a philosophy, it is a method that is supposed to contribute to philosophical inquiry. Characteristically, experimental philosophers use empirical techniques to investigate philosophically significant intuitions about cases. An intuition, in this context, is a spontaneous judgement a person makes about a case with little or no conscious reason for their judgement.
         Intuitions play a key role in much philosophical theorizing. The attempt to provide a conceptual analysis or definition for important philosophical concepts, e.g. knowledge, meaning, responsibility, has long been a major theoretical concern in philosophy. One prominent philosophical view holds that the meaning of our concepts is given by the folk theory (or set of common-sense beliefs) in which the concepts are embedded. Intuitions about cases are thought to reveal the contours of the folk theory and the meaning of the concept. As a result, in pursuing conceptual analyses, many philosophers rely on intuitions about cases to descry the folk theories in which those concepts are embedded.
         In addition to their role in conceptual analysis, philosophers invoke intuitions as evidence for substantive philosophical claims, perhaps in much the same way as empirical scientists invoke observation as evidence. For instance, the intuition that it is wrong to push one man in front of a speeding trolley to save five others is invoked as evidence that utilitarianism does not give the right theory of how we ought to act. Similarly, intuitions are used to support substantive claims about knowledge, meaning and responsibility.
         When philosophers use intuitions - whether in the service of conceptual analysis or in the effort to establish a more substantive philosophical claim - the traditional methodology looks a priori. That is, one arrives at one’s judgements without relying on evidence from sensory perception. For instance, to analyse the concept intentional a philosopher might consult their intuitions about whether the concept applies in various actual and possible circumstances, and a condition of adequacy upon the definition is that it best conforms to these intuitions. In contrast, experimental philosophers use experimental techniques to study intuitions about philosophically important concepts."
10.4324/9780415249126-q080-1,"Geology, philosophy of","In the mid-1960s, geology underwent a conceptual revolution. Prior to that time, most geologists believed that the continents and oceans were fixed and permanent, the basic features of the earth’s crust. Subsequently they came to agree that the earth was covered by rigid plates, thin in relation to the earth’s diameter, in which the continents were embedded like logs in icebergs. It was the creation, movement and destruction of these plates that were responsible for the mid-ocean ridges, the areas of mountain building and earthquake activity, and the deep ocean trenches.
         This conceptual revolution also marks a shift in the philosophy of geology. From the early nineteenth century, the chief philosophical question posed by geology was whether a historical science encountered special epistemic problems, a question that was usually answered by invoking the principle of uniformitarianism. In its strict form this stated that the only kind and intensities of causes that could be used to explain past geological phenomena were those that could be directly observed. Many sloppier formulations were invoked under the same name. Since the revolution, philosophers have turned to geology chiefly to use the revolution to exemplify or challenge one or another theory of scientific change."
10.4324/9780415249126-q118-1,Postcolonial philosophy of science,"Are there laws of nature that today’s modern sciences are ill-designed to discover? Does the universal use of these modern sciences require their value-neutrality, or are their social values and interests an important cause of their universality? What resources for scientific knowledge can other cultures’ science projects provide?
         Such questions are raised by recent postcolonial global histories that focus analyses on the role of European expansion in the advance of modern science and in the decline of other cultures’ science traditions. These accounts challenge philosophers to re-evaluate unsuspected strengths in other scientific traditions and identify modern science’s borrowings from them. They also identify European cultural features that have, for better and worse, constituted modern sciences and their representations of nature and thus seek to develop more realistic and useful accounts of the values, interests, methods, universality, objectivity and rationality of science."
10.4324/9780415249126-s019-1,Green political philosophy,"All the major political philosophies have been born of crisis. Green political philosophy is no exception to this general rule. It has emerged from that interconnected series of crises that is often termed ‘the environmental crisis’. As we enter the third millennium and the twenty-first century it seems quite clear that the level and degree of environmental degradation and destruction cannot be sustained over the longer term without dire consequences for human and other animal species, and the ecosystems on which all depend. A veritable explosion in the human population, the pollution of air and water, the over-fishing of the oceans, the destruction of tropical and temperate rain forests, the extinction of entire species, the depletion of the ozone layer, the build-up of greenhouse gases, global warming, desertification, wind and water erosion of precious topsoil, the disappearance of valuable farmland and wilderness for ‘development’ – these and many other interrelated phenomena provide the backdrop and justification for the ‘greening’ of much of modern political thinking.
         The task of outlining and summarizing the state of green political philosophy is made more difficult because there is as yet no agreement among ‘green’ political thinkers. Indeed there is, at present, no definitive ‘green political philosophy’ as such. The environmental or green movement is diverse and disparate, and appears in different shades of green. These range from ‘light green’ conservationists to ‘dark green’ deep ecologists, from ecofeminists to social ecologists, from the militant ecoteurs of Earth First! to the low-keyed gradualists of the Sierra Club and the Nature Conservancy. These groups differ not only over strategy and tactics, but also over fundamental philosophy.
         While there is no single, systematically articulated and agreed-upon green political philosophy, however, there are none the less recurring topics, themes, categories and concepts that are surely central to such a political philosophy. These include the idea that humans are part of nature and members of a larger and more inclusive ‘biotic community’ to which they have obligations or duties. This community includes both human and non-human animals, and the conditions conducive to their survival and flourishing. Such a community consists, moreover, not only of members who are alive but those who are as yet unborn. A green political philosophy values both biological and cultural diversity, and views sustainability as a standard by which to judge the justness of human actions and practices. Exactly how these themes might fit together to form some larger, systematic and coherent whole is still being worked out."
10.4324/9780415249126-s043-1,"Political philosophy, history of","The history of political philosophy attempts to yield a connected account of past speculation on the character of human association at its most inclusive level. ‘History’ or ‘philosophy’ may be stressed depending on whether the organizing principle is the temporal sequence or conceptual framework of political thought. Anglophone work has increasingly been organized around distinctive political ‘languages’ defined by specific vocabularies, syntaxes and problems, for example, classical republicanism, Roman law, natural law, utilitarianism. Chronologically it has been usual to observe divisions between ancient, medieval, Renaissance, early modern and modern periods of study.
         Ancient Greece is the source of the earliest political reflection, with a continuous history in the West. Here reflection on the nature and proper organization of political community stimulated inquiry into the difference between nature and convention, the public and the domestic realm, the distinctive character of political rule, the relationship between political life and philosophy, the identity of justice, and the taxonomy of state-forms – as well as a more sociological investigation of the stability and decline of political regimes.
         Greek political vocabulary was adapted to existing Roman republican practice (by Polybius and Cicero for example), which soon gave way to an imperial constitution stressing peace, order and unity. Rome thus generated two contrasting political ideals – that of the virtuous active republican citizen, and that of the unified empire governed by Roman law. Together with questions about the causes of its own rise and decline, Rome thus provided political values and historical material for subsequent philosophical and historical reflection.
         Christianity undermined the pagan autonomy of politics in the name of a higher, transcendent ideal. However, it adapted much of Greek rationalism and the political vocabulary of classical culture in elaborating a creed and an institutional form. In turn it lent legitimacy to imperial and royal officeholders of Rome and barbarian successor-kingdoms.
         Medieval political philosophy was characteristically preoccupied with the relationship between pope and king, church and regnum, but philosophy as a discipline was subordinated to theology. This was challenged by the rediscovery of Aristotle’s self-sufficiently secular political ideal, a challenge met for a while by Aquinas’ synthesis. However, the autonomy of secular politics was continually reasserted by a sequence of writers – Bartolus of Sassoferrato, Marsilius of Padua, Bruni and Machiavelli – who revived and reformulated classical republicanism using both Roman law and new Renaissance techniques and insights.
         The Reformation, although initially politically quiescent, gave rise to new conflicts between secular and sacred rule. In particular, radical claims about the responsibility of all believers for their own salvation fed through in various ways into more individualistic political philosophies. In early modern Europe, using the strikingly new (and originally Catholic) vocabulary of natural right, Hugo Grotius aspired to provide a common secular basis for a shared political morality, on the basis of individual rights derived from a universal right of self-preservation. This was widely explored by seventeenth and eighteenth century thinkers, notably Hobbes and Locke, and culminated politically in the American and French Revolutions. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, language of natural rights was rejected both by conservative thinkers, such as Burke, and by a new, utilitarian radicalism largely forged by Bentham.
         Attempts to grasp the political character of economic transformations and Empire in early modern Europe resulted in a growing engagement with the essentially historical character of politics, the dynamic of which republican discourse was particularly well suited to exploring. Avoiding the loss of liberty which the acquisition of Empire had seemed to entail in Rome involved rethinking possible patterns of politico-economic development, providing a new definition of liberty which stressed personal and economic over political freedom, and proposing that impersonal institutional devices could replace virtuous motives in guaranteeing political liberty and stability. Such possibilities were explored by Montesquieu and Constant in France, Hume and Smith in Britain and ‘Publius’ (Madison, Hamilton and Jay) in America. They were rejected outright by Rousseau, for whom only the active citizen could guarantee rights, civic or civil.
         The French Revolution was not only an event in which political philosophy played an important if hotly contested role; it also, like the rise and fall of Rome, provided a central topic for subsequent political reflection. The character of modernity, the nature of revolution, the relationship of political ideas to political action, the strength or weakness of rationalism as an informing principle, the viability and desirability of the Revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity, all became topics of philosophical speculation by post-Revolutionary thinkers such as Constant, Cabet, de Tocqueville, Burke, de Maistre, Saint-Simon, Owen and Coleridge, as well as a later generation including Comte, Carlyle and Marx.
         In contrast to his predecessors’ use of Lockean psychology and the conditioning effects of experience and association to understand the processes of socio-economic change, Kant’s postulation of the transcendent self initiated a new vocabulary of idealism. This culminated in Hegel’s attempt to show how philosophical and historical (including political) change could be understood as the development and realization of a trans-historical consciousness or Geist, seeking to overcome internal tensions through a process of projection and transcendence.
         The notion that human self-understanding and practices are to be understood historically immensely influenced subsequent political thinking, being central to the ideas of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud (as well as shaping many of J.S. Mill’s modifications of classical utilitarianism). All three of the former owed insights to Hegel’s claims about the crucial and emblematic character of the master–slave struggle. However, while for Hegel and Marx the slave’s insights represent the transition to a higher form of consciousness – mediated in Marx’s case by a class revolution – for Nietzsche (despairingly) and Freud (resignedly) repression was a constitutive and self-perpetuating feature of modern politics.
         While nineteenth century political thought was preoccupied with the historical conditioning of political sensibilities, Freud’s discovery of the unconscious was accompanied by the emergence of a mass, irrationalist politics, characteristic of the twentieth century, and more suited to sociological than philosophical analysis. Nevertheless rationalist political theory, deriving from utilitarianism, and frequently drawing on (and contributing to) economic thought, remains the dominant accent in contemporary political philosophy."
10.4324/9780415249126-s066-1,"War and peace, philosophy of","The war/peace dichotomy is a recurrent one in human thought and the range of experience it interprets is vast. Images of war and peace permeate religion, literature and art. Wars, battles, pacts and covenants appear as outcomes and antecedents in historical narratives. Recurrent patterns of warlike and pacific behaviour invite scientific explanations in terms of underlying biological, psychological or economic processes. War and peace are also often matters of practical concern, predicaments or opportunities that call for individual or collective action. While philosophers have explored all these ways of looking at war and peace, they have paid most attention to the practical aspects of the subject, making it part of moral and political philosophy.
         Practical concern with war and peace can go in either of two main directions, one focusing on war and the other on peace. Those who doubt that war can be abolished naturally worry about how it can be regulated. So long as war is possible, there will be principles for waging it. Whether such principles should limit war-making to ends like self-defence or leave the choice to the discretion of political and military leaders is a matter of continuing dispute. Nor is there agreement regarding restrictions on the conduct of war, some holding that belligerents need only avoid disproportionate damage, others that it is morally wrong to harm innocents (for example, noncombatants). In situations of emergency both limits may give way, and moralists have debated whether this relaxation of standards is defensible. Disputes over the principles governing war raise difficult questions about action, intention and the character of morality itself.
         If we think that wars can be prevented, it becomes important to focus on the conditions of permanent peace. Some who do this conclude that peace depends on the conversion of individuals to an ethic of nonviolence, others that it requires strengthening the rule of law. According to a powerful version of the latter argument, the absence of law creates a condition in which persons and communities are at liberty to invade one another: a condition that, in Hobbes’s classic metaphor, is a ‘state of nature’ which is also a perpetual state of war. While treaties of peace may terminate particular wars, only political institutions that establish the rule of law within and between communities can provide security and guarantee peace."
10.4324/9780415249126-b089-1,Patristic philosophy,"Early Christian writers used terminology and ideas drawn from Graeco-Roman philosophical literature in their theological writings, and some early Christians also engaged in more formal philosophical reflection. The term ‘patristic philosophy’ covers all of these activities by the ‘fathers’ (patres) of the Church. The literature of nascent Christianity thus contains many concepts drawn from Graeco-Roman philosophy, and this early use of classical ideas by prominent Christians provided an authoritative sanction for subsequent philosophical discussion and elaboration.
         Early Christians were drawn to philosophy for many reasons. Philosophy held a pre-eminent place in the culture of the late Hellenistic and Roman world. Its schools provided training in logical rigour, systematic accounts of the cosmos and directions on how to lead a good and happy life. While philosophical movements of the period, such as Neoplatonism or Stoicism, varied widely in their doctrines, most presented accounts of reality that included some representation of the divine. These rationally articulated accounts established the theological and ethical discourse of Graeco-Roman culture. As such, philosophy had a natural appeal to Hellenistic Jewish and early Christian thinkers. It provided a ready language in which to refine ideas about the God of the ancient Hebrew scriptures, and to elaborate the trinitarian God of Christianity. It also helped to bring conceptual coherence to the ideas found in the scriptures of both religions. Finally, it provided the common intellectual discourse that those communities required in order to present their central tenets to the majority culture of the Roman empire.
         To a considerable extent, the notion of ‘philosophy’ suggested to the ancients a way of life as much as an intellectual discipline. This too drew Christians to the teachings of the philosophers. While there were doctrines and prescriptions of behaviour specific to the major schools, philosophers in general tended to advocate an ethically reflective and usually rather ascetic life, one which conjoined intellectual with moral discipline. This ethical austerity was prized by early Christians as an allied phenomenon within Graeco-Roman culture to which they could appeal in debates about the character of their new movement. The tacit validation that philosophy offered to the Christian movement was thus multifaceted, and, while it was sometimes thought to be associated with unacceptable aspects of pagan religious culture, philosophy provided some educated Christians with a subtle social warrant for their new life and beliefs.
         It should be noted that ancient Christianity was itself a complex movement. Like Graeco-Roman philosophy, Christianity included a broad spectrum of beliefs and practices. Thus those early Christians who developed their beliefs with reference to philosophy endorsed a wide range of metaphysical and ethical doctrines, ranging from materialism to extreme transcendentalism, from asceticism to spiritual libertinism. Yet, while diversity is evident, it is also true that the Christian movement came to develop a rough set of central beliefs and some early forms of community organization associated with those beliefs. This incipient ‘orthodoxy’ came to value some sorts of philosophy, especially Platonism, which seemed best suited to its theological agenda. This tacit alliance with Platonism was fraught with ambiguity and uncertainty, and it was never a reciprocal relationship. Nonetheless, in the second and third centuries a type of Christian philosophical theology emerged which owed much to the Platonic school and became increasingly dominant among orthodox Christian authors. It was this trajectory that defined the character of patristic philosophy.
         Early Christian thought had its origins in Hellenistic Judaism, and its initial character was defined by the dominant patterns of that tradition. This early phase extended through the first half of the second century ad, as Christianity began to define its distinctive themes associated with the nature and historical mission of Jesus Christ. Throughout the second century, Christianity became increasingly a movement made up of gentile converts; some of these new members had educations that had included philosophy and a few were even trained as philosophers. Thus Christian thought began to show increased contact with the Graeco-Roman philosophical schools, a trend no doubt reinforced by the critical need for Christians – as a proscribed religious minority – to defend their theology, ritual practices and ethics in the face of cultural and legal hostility.
         This so-called ‘age of the apologists’ lasted throughout the second and third centuries, until Christianity began to enjoy toleration early in the fourth century. However, it would be a mistake to consider Christian philosophical thought in that period as primarily directed towards the surrounding pagan society. In many respects philosophy, as the intellectual discourse of Graeco-Roman culture, offered gentile Christians a means to clarify, articulate and assimilate the tenets of their new faith. This process of intellectual appropriation appears to have been of considerable personal importance to many Graeco-Roman converts. Christian philosophical theology helped them to recover ideas familiar from their school training and to find unfamiliar concepts defended with the rigour much prized within Graeco-Roman culture.
         After Christianity became a licit religion in the fourth century, philosophical activity among Christians expanded. The task of theological self-articulation became increasingly significant as Christianity grew in the fourth and fifth centuries towards majority status within the Empire, with imperial support. In this later period the range and sophistication of Christian thought increased significantly, due in part to the influence of pagan Neoplatonism, a movement that included a number of the finest philosophers active since the classical period of Plato and Aristotle. Later patristic philosophy had a defining influence upon medieval Christian thought through such figures as Augustine and Dionysius the pseudo-Areopagite, establishing both the conceptual foundations and the authoritative warrant for the scholasticism of the Latin West and Greek East."
10.4324/9780415249126-dc096-1,American philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries,"Jonathan Edwards, the first great American philosopher, interpreted Calvinist theology within the newer framework of Newtonian physics and Lockean empiricism in his Freedom of the Will (1754). However, he was all but forgotten by the end of the eighteenth century, when political rather than theological issues held centre stage. In the years leading up to the American Revolution, the moral sense theory of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, Lockean liberalism and classical republican theory all contributed to the thought of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and others who saw themselves as parties to a contract with a monarch, defenders of the rights of humans, and members of a new and virtuous republic.
         In the early nineteenth century, Scottish common sense realism prevailed in the universities, but the most original and influential philosophical writing came from the communities of the transcendentalists. Emerson and Thoreau developed philosophies of life, language, knowledge and being in writings drawing on the Greek and Roman classics, English and German Romanticism, Christianity, and non-Western thought. After the Civil War (1861–5), a series of clubs in the East and Midwest, and the new Journal of Speculative Philosophy made Hegel more accessible to Americans; while in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the ‘Metaphysical Club’ of William James, Charles Peirce, Chauncey Wright and Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr became the birthplace of pragmatism.
         The last quarter of the nineteenth century saw the professionalization of American philosophy: new graduate departments at Harvard and Johns Hopkins, professional journals, and state-supported universities in the Midwest building non-denominational departments of philosophy. By the end of the century, James had published his vast Principles of Psychology (1890) and enunciated a version of pragmatism; Peirce had produced an outpouring of writing on pragmatism, scientific method, logic, semiotics and metaphysics; and Josiah Royce and John Dewey were launched on influential academic careers."
10.4324/9780415249126-dd091-1,Analytical philosophy,"Philosophical analysis is a method of inquiry in which one seeks to assess complex systems of thought by ‘analysing’ them into simpler elements whose relationships are thereby brought into focus. This method has a long history, but became especially prominent at the start of the twentieth century and, by becoming integrated into Russell’s development of logical theory, acquired a greater degree of sophistication than before. The logical positivists developed the method further during the 1930s and, in the context of their anti-metaphysical programme, held that analysis was the only legitimate philosophical inquiry. Thus for them philosophy could only be ‘analytical philosophy’.
         After 1945 those philosophers who wanted to expand philosophical inquiries beyond the limits prescribed by the positivists extended the understanding of analysis to include accounts of the general structures of language and thought without the earlier commitment to the identification of ‘simple’ elements of thought. Hence there developed a more relaxed conception of ‘linguistic analysis’ and the understanding of ‘analytical philosophy’ was modified in such a way that a critical concern with language and meaning was taken to be central to it, leading, indeed, to a retrospective re-evaluation of the role of Frege as a founder of analytical philosophy. At the same time, however, Quine propounded influential arguments which suggest that methods of analysis can have no deep significance because there is no determinate structure to systems of thought or language for the analytical philosopher to analyse and assess. Hence some contemporary philosophers proclaim that we have now reached ‘the end of analytical philosophy’. But others, who find Quine’s arguments unpersuasive, hold that analytical philosophy has virtues quite sufficient to ensure it a role as a central philosophical method for the foreseeable future."
10.4324/9780415249126-g104-1,Bushi philosophy,"Bushi is one of several terms for the warrior of premodern Japan; samurai is another. The ‘way of the warrior’ – that is, the beliefs, attitudes and patterns of behaviour of the premodern Japanese warrior – is commonly called bushidō (literally, the ‘way of the bushi’). However, bushidō is actually a phrase of rather late derivation, and in premodern times was never exclusively used to describe the warrior way.
         Two of the earliest and most enduring phrases for the way of the warriors who rose in the provinces of Japan in the late ninth and tenth centuries were the ‘way of the bow and arrow’ and the ‘way of the bow and horse’. These phrases, however, referred to little more than prowess in the military arts, the most important of which, as the second phrase clearly specifies, were horse riding and archery. For many centuries no one in Japan undertook to define systematically what the way of the warrior in a larger sense was or should be. Warrior beliefs, ideals and aspirations – including loyalty, courage, the yearning for battlefield fame, fear of shame and an acute sense of honour and ‘face’ – were widely recognized, but neither warriors nor others apparently felt the need to codify them in writing.
         Not until the establishment of the Tokugawa military government (shogunate) in 1600, which brought two and a half centuries of nearly uninterrupted peace to Japan, did philosophers begin to study and write about the warrior way (bushidō). Concerned about the meaning and proper role of a ruling warrior class during an age of peace, philosophers posited that warriors should not only maintain military preparedness to deal with fighting that might occur, but should also develop themselves, through education based primarily on Confucianism, to serve as models and moral exemplars for all classes of Japanese society."
10.4324/9780415249126-j037-1,Jewish philosophy in the early 19th century,"Although Jewish philosophy flourished in the Middle Ages, it underwent a serious decline in 1492, when the Jews were expelled from Spain. The period following Kant and Mendelssohn witnessed an attempt to reintegrate Jewish philosophy into the mainstream of Western culture. The strategy of reintegration consisted of two elements: (1) showing that there is more to Judaism than the study of Scripture and (2) arguing that some of the ideas that won favour in the Enlightenment were anticipated by Jews centuries earlier.
         The most central idea that Jewish thinkers claimed as their own is a shift in focus from theoretical issues to practical ones. As important features of the medieval worldview fell into disrepute, many philosophers began to ask whether there are limits to what human reason can know. Can it really prove that God exists or that the soul is immortal? One response was to argue that even if no proof can be found, there are still grounds for believing, particularly if our understanding of ourselves as moral agents makes no sense without them.
         But it did not take long for people to argue that moral agency requires not just a God but a free and transcendent God capable of issuing commands to free agents created in the divine image. Here too, Jewish thinkers claimed that the idea of a God who is not limited by nature and insists on mercy and justice for all people was an integral part of monotheism as understood by the Hebrew prophets."
10.4324/9780415249126-f084-1,Testimony in Indian philosophy,"A prominent topic in Indian epistemology is śābdapramāṇa, knowledge derived from linguistic utterance or testimony. The classical material is extensive and varied, initially concerned with providing grounds for accepting the wisdom of śruti or ‘the heard word’, that is, the canonical scriptures. The Buddhists, however, saw no need for śābdajñāna (information gained through words) as an independent source of knowledge, because any utterance (including the Buddha’s) that has not been tested in one’s own experience cannot be relied upon; and in any case, the operation of such knowledge can be accounted for in terms of inference and perception.
         The Nyāya, following the Mīmāṃsā, developed sophisticated analyses and a spirited defence of the viability and autonomy of testimony. The problem is recast thus: is śābdapramāṇa linguistic knowledge eo ipso, or does verbal understanding amount to knowledge only when certain specifiable conditions, in addition to the generating conditions, are satisfied? The more usual answer is that where the speaker is reliable and sincere, and there is no evidence to the contrary, the generating semantic and phenomenological conditions suffice to deliver valid knowledge. If doubt arises, then other resources can be utilized for checking the truth or falsity of the understanding, or the reliability of the author (or nonpersonal source), and for overcoming the defects."
10.4324/9780415249126-h002-1,Aristotelianism in Islamic philosophy,"In Arabic, Aristotle was referred to by name as Aristutalis or, more frequently, Aristu, although when quoted he was often referred to by a sobriquet such as ‘the wise man’. Aristotle was also generally known as the First Teacher. Following the initial reception of Hellenistic texts into Islamic thought in al-Kindi’s time, al-Farabi rediscovered a ‘purer’ version in the tenth century. In an allusion to his dependence on Aristotle, al-Farabi was called the Second Teacher. Ibn Rushd, known in the West as Averroes, was the last great Arabophone commentator on Aristotle, writing numerous treatises on his works. A careful examination of the Aristotelian works received by the Arabs indicates they were generally aware of the true Aristotle. Later, transmission of these works to Christian Europe allowed Aristotelianism to flourish in the scholastic period.
         We should not take at face value the Islamic philosophers’ claims that they were simply following Aristotle. The convention in Islamic philosophy is to state that one is repeating the wisdom of the past, thus covering over such originality as may exist. There was a tendency among Islamic philosophers to cite Aristotle as an authority in order to validate their own claims and ideas."

It is a reflection of the relationship of imperial and intellectual domination of a West which feels it is superior to an ‘inferior’ East. This often results in an understanding of Islamic philosophy which sees the latter as essentially unoriginal, derivative and of only historical interest. While orientalists have produced interesting and important work, most fail to appreciate the independent status of the material which they analyse."
10.4324/9780415249126-n053-1,"Spain, philosophy in","Historians have argued about precisely when to date the commencement of Spanish history proper, rendering dubious any reference to Spain as such in the period prior to the official constitution of nationality. If this is the case, one can not really speak of philosophy in Spain before 1474, although it remains a fact that philosophy had been practised on the Iberian Peninsula from the earliest times. During the period of the Roman Empire, distinguished philosophical figures included Lucius Annqeus Seneca; under Visigothic rule, Saint Isidore of Seville came to the fore; and the Islamic Empire featured some of the most eminent philosophers of the Arabic and Judaic traditions, such as Ibn Hazm, Averroes, Ibn Gabirol, Yehuda Ha-Levi and Maimonides. There is no doubt that the centre of philosophical activity within the peninsula during the Middle Ages was the so-called School of Translators of Toledo, where numerous thinkers from many countries gathered. Together with Spanish scholars such as Domingo Gundisalvo and Juan Hispano, they collaborated in making Greek philosophy available to the countries of Europe; instrumental in this process were Gerard of Cremona, Daniel of Morlay, Alexander Neckham and Michael Scot.
         After Spanish nationality was constituted under the Catholic Monarchs (1474–1516) on the basis of a single, unified faith, philosophy was destined to become closely linked with religion. During the sixteenth century, this gave rise to a burgeoning of philosophy of the very highest order, which followed two separate paths: that of the Erasmian-style Renaissance, featuring Luis Vives, which developed in line with the vanguard of the European Renaissance; and that of Spanish Scholasticism, which was fuelled by the thrust of the Counter-Reformation on the one hand, and by the discovery of America on the other. After the reigns of Charles I and Philip II (the chief protagonists in the creation of the empire ‘in which the sun never set’), the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries witnessed a relentless decline which, towards the beginning of the twentieth, seemed to come to an end. The Generation of 1898, with its revolutionary secular theories, provided the catalyst for a philosophical recovery whose greatest protagonists were Miguel de Unamuno, José Ortega y Gasset and Xavier Zubir. These thinkers were succeeded by the philosophers who went into exile after the Civil War of 1936–9: José Ferrater Mora, José Gaos, María Zambrano, Joaquín Xirau, and Juan David García Bacca."
10.4324/9780415249126-n028-1,"Italy, philosophy in","Since the Renaissance, Italian philosophy has been rooted in the humanist and historical tradition, stemming from the rediscovery of Greek philosophy in the fifteenth century and the resumption of classical studies at that time. However, the momentous cultural and religious transformations of sixteenth-century Europe caused a reaction which greatly restrained the innovative impact of Renaissance thought. Living through these two periods, Bruno, Campanella and Galileo experienced all the conflicts of the Counter-Reformation, when philosophy especially felt the weight of the Roman Catholic Church which exercised a tight control on the culture of the time. The best traditions of the Renaissance were inherited and maintained solely by Vico, the most important figure of this latter period.
         As the spirit of the Counter-Reformation declined, Italian philosophy acquired a new vigour in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This occurred especially in the north of the country where contacts with modern European culture influenced a political situation dominated by the question of national unity (a problem debated since the time of Machiavelli). Philosophical thought during this period tended to be strongly political (as in the philosophy of Cattaneo), although it also assumed a deeply religious tone (for example, Mazzini and Gioberti). These themes were united in Hegelian Idealism, promoted by Spaventa among others. The neo-Idealists of the early twentieth century, such as Croce and Gentile, distinguished themselves by assuming a political role and by opposing empiricism and positivism, philosophical heirs of the Enlightenment which were traditionally considered alien although popular at that time.
         The aftermath of the Second World War brought to gradual dissolution both philosophical and political neo-Idealism, a movement which was rooted especially at the universities of Rome and Naples; it also saw the rise of Marxist thought (Gramsci) and Existentialism, especially at the universities of Bologna, Milan and Turin. Among the most important figures in contemporary Italian philosophy we find Bobbio (political philosophy), Pareyson, Vattimo and Eco. While both French and German philosophy still play a major role in the philosophical debate, in recent years increasing attention has been paid to Anglo-Saxon philosophy."
10.4324/9780415249126-n108-1,"Romania, philosophy in","The origins of Romanian philosophical thinking can be traced back to the late Middle Ages. The first attempts were made in monasteries and princely courts; the language used was Church Slavonic or Latin. The first original philosophical work in Romanian dates from 1698 and was written by Dimitrie Cantemir, Prince of Moldavia. The first Romanian philosophical school, the Transylvanian School, formed in Transylvania at the end of the eighteenth century, was an expression of Enlightenment ideas. Romanian philosophical thinking in the nineteenth century was imbued with the ideas of the Enlightenment and Kantianism.
         Romanian modern culture and, implicitly, modern Romanian philosophy were born in the second half of the nineteenth century, under the influence of Titu Maiorescu, a major cultural personality. At the peak of its evolution between the two world wars, Romanian philosophy had the following characteristic features: it was closely related to literature, in the sense that most Romanian philosophers were also important writers; it showed excessive preoccupation with the issue of Romanian identity; it was involved in Romania’s historical, political and ideological debates, fuelling attitudes in favour of or against Westernization and modernization; it synchronized quickly with Western philosophical thinking; and it was (and still is) lacking in ethical thought.
         During the first half of the twentieth century, Romanian philosophers focused mainly on discussing the status of metaphysics and its right to existence, followed by any individual efforts to set up an original philosophical system; secondly, they were interested in the issue of identity, the theme of Romanian-ness, which led to the development of the philosophy of culture and history, and to the involvement of philosophers in politics. The most important original philosophical constructions were those of Lucian Blaga and Constantin Noica.
         During the communist regime, an initial period of complete stagnation of independent thinking was followed, at the beginning of the 1960s, by a relative liberalization that favoured research in logic, the philosophy of science, and the writing of literary-philosophical essays.
         Romanian philosophy since 1989 has made efforts to restructure its institutional framework, reclaim the formerly forbidden fields, and synchronize - through translations and studies - with contemporary world philosophy."
10.4324/9780415249126-n015-1,"Education, philosophy of","The philosophy of education is primarily concerned with the nature, aims and means of education, and also with the character and structure of educational theory, and its own place in that structure. Educational theory is best regarded as a kind of practical theory which would ideally furnish useful guidance for every aspect and office of educational practice. Such guidance would rest in a well-grounded and elaborated account of educational aims and the moral and political dimensions of education, and also in adequate conceptions and knowledge of teaching, learning, evaluation, the structure and dynamics of educational and social systems, the roles of relevant stake-holders and the like.
         Philosophers of education often approach educational issues from the vantage points of other philosophical sub-disciplines, and contribute in a variety of ways to the larger unfinished project of educational theory. These contributions may be divided into work on the nature and aims of education, on the normative dimensions of the methods and circumstances of education, and on the conceptual and methodological underpinnings of its methods and circumstances – either directly or through work on the foundations of other forms of research relied upon by education theory.
         Philosophical analysis and argument have suggested certain aims as essential to education, and various movements and branches of philosophy, from Marxism and existentialism to epistemology and ethics, have suggested aims, in every case controversially. Thus, one encounters normative theories of thought, conduct and the aims of education inspired by a broad consideration of epistemology, logic, aesthetics and ethics, as well as Marxism, feminism and a host of other ‘-isms’. In this mode of educational philosophizing, the objects of various branches of philosophical study are proposed as the ends of education, and the significance of pursuing those ends is elaborated with reference to those branches of study.
         A second form of educational philosophy derives from substantive arguments and theories of ethics, social and political philosophy and philosophy of law, and concerns itself with the aims of education and the acceptability of various means to achieve them. It revolves around arguments concerning the moral, social and political appropriateness of educational aims, initiatives and policies, and moral evaluation of the methods, circumstances and effects of education. Recent debate has been dominated by concerns about children’s rights and freedom, educational equality and justice, moral and political education, and issues of authority, control and professional ethics.
         The philosophy of education has also sought to guide educational practice through examining its assumptions about the structure of specific knowledge domains and the minds of learners; about learning, development, motivation, and the communication and acquisition of knowledge and understanding. Philosophy of science and mathematics have informed the design of curriculum, pedagogy and evaluation in the teaching of science and mathematics. Philosophy of mind, language and psychology bear on the foundations of our understanding of how learning occurs, and thus how teaching may best promote it."
10.4324/9780415249126-k083-1,Religion and political philosophy,"Political philosophy began in Athens, but the large-scale impact of religion upon it had to await Christianity. Biblical Christianity portrays human beings as subjects of a kingdom of God, destined for a supernatural end and bound to love one another. This view is potentially in tension with the demands of the various political societies to which Christians belong. The requirement of devotion to God might conflict with the allegiance that temporal government demands; human beings’ attempts to attain their supernatural end can bring them into conflict with civil laws. The power and structure of the Church in the Middle Ages opened the possibility of tensions between the authority of the institutional Church and of various national states. These tensions, potential and actual, set much of political philosophy’s agenda from the fourth to the fourteenth century.
         The tension between membership of the kingdom of God and of an earthly polity was forcefully described by Augustine. He likened faithful Christians to pilgrims journeying through the world, who avail themselves of the peace temporal authority provides. Political thinkers of the early Middle Ages examined the conditions under which war, regicide and disobedience were permissible, and queried whether the Pope had authority over temporal rulers. Thomas Aquinas elaborated a theory of natural law according to which valid human law cannot conflict with the dictates of morality. Temporal rulers, he argued, are responsible for promoting their subjects’ common good and eternal salvation.
         Since the sixteenth century, political philosophy has been concerned with problems set by the religious developments that ushered in the modern period. The Reformation brought religious diversity to European nations on a large scale. It thereby raised questions about how policy could be set and unity maintained without a shared religion to provide common goals and social bonds. The seventeenth-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes opposed the toleration of religious diversity and argued that states could remain unified only if their religious unity were maintained by an absolute sovereign. John Locke, on the other hand, argued for the right to religious liberty. Locke and other liberals associated with the movement of thought known as the Enlightenment were opposed by classical conservatives such as Edmund Burke. Burke argued that human society depended upon willing adherence to traditional customs and social institutions, including an established national Church. More recently, liberalism has also been opposed by Marxism. Marxists argue that religion helps to maintain social stability under modern conditions by masking the exploitation of the working class.
         Contemporary political philosophy in the English-speaking world is descended from the Enlightenment liberalism of Locke. John Rawls argues that social cooperation must be based only upon what citizens of liberal democracies can reasonably affirm under ideal conditions. Religious critics of contemporary liberalism argue that it unduly restricts religiously inspired political argument and activism."
10.4324/9780415249126-k067-1,"Religion, history of philosophy of","The philosophy of religion comprises any philosophical discussion of questions arising from religion. This has primarily consisted in the clarification and critical evaluation of fundamental beliefs and concepts from one or another religious tradition. Major issues of concern in the philosophy of religion include arguments for and against the existence of God, problems about the attributes of God, the problem of evil, and the epistemology of religious belief.
         Of arguments for the existence of God, the most prominent ones can be assigned to four types. First, cosmological arguments, which go back to Plato and Aristotle, explain the existence of the universe by reference to a being on whom all else depends for its existence. Second, teleological arguments seek to explain adaptation in the world, for example, the way organisms have structures adapted to their needs, by positing an intelligent designer of the world. Third, ontological arguments, first introduced by Anselm, focus on the concept of a perfect being and argue that it is incoherent to deny that such a being exists. Finally, moral arguments maintain that objective moral statuses, distinctions or principles presuppose a divine being as the locus of their objectivity.
         Discussions of the attributes of God have focused on omniscience and omnipotence. These raise various problems, for example, whether complete divine foreknowledge of human actions is compatible with human free will. Moreover, these attributes, together with God’s perfect goodness give rise to the problem of evil. If God is all-powerful, all-knowing and perfectly good, how can there be wickedness, suffering and other undesirable states of affairs in the world? This problem has been repeatedly discussed from ancient times to the present.
         The epistemology of religious belief has to do with the questions of what is the proper approach to the assessment of religious belief (for rationality, justification, or whatever) and with the carrying out of such assessments. Much of the discussion has turned on the contrast between the roles of human reason and God’s revelation to us. A variety of views have been held on this. Many, such as Aquinas, have tried to forge a synthesis of the two; Kant and his followers have sought to ground religion solely on reason; others, most notably Kierkegaard, have held that the subjecting of religious belief to rational scrutiny is subversive of true religious faith. Recently, a group of ‘Reformed epistemologists’ (so-called because of the heavy influence of the Reformed theology of Calvin and his followers on their thinking) has attacked ‘evidentialism’ and has argued that religious beliefs can be rationally justified even if one has no reasons or evidence for them."
10.4324/9780415249126-n002-1,"Australia, philosophy in","Australian academic philosophy has made an international impact disproportionate to the country’s small population, though its beginnings contain little that might have suggested such influence. The first Philosophy Chair was established at the University of Melbourne in 1886 and its occupant Henry Laurie was more notable for extravagant shyness than public impact or academic achievement. Until the 1920s, the dominant philosophical outlook was idealism. After the arrival from Glasgow of the charismatic John Anderson to the Chair in Sydney in 1927, this outlook was challenged by his vigorous, distinctive, highly metaphysical and somewhat dogmatic version of realism. Anderson had little international recognition during his working life, but he had a powerful effect upon Australian cultural life and upon students who themselves achieved a significant international presence. Thinkers like David Armstrong, John Mackie and John Passmore diverged in many ways from Andersonianism but the indelible mark of the Sydney baptism remained with them even when they had accommodated to the international profile.
         For twenty-five years or so, there was a strong contrast and rivalry between the style of philosophy done in Sydney and that done in Melbourne. Idealist influences persisted longer in Melbourne due to the two Boyce Gibsons (father and son) who occupied the Melbourne Chair successively, but the significant contrasts really began when Melbourne came under the sway of Wittgenstein’s philosophy in the 1940s. This was due principally to the presence during the war years of G.A. Paul, one of Wittgenstein’s pupils, and later Paul’s friend Douglas Gasking, who had studied under Wittgenstein in Cambridge, and another pupil of Wittgenstein, A.C. (‘Camo’) Jackson. Where Anderson’s orientation was systematic, metaphysical and provincial, the Melbournians were piecemeal, anti-metaphysical and (relatively) cosmopolitan. As a direct force in academic philosophy, Anderson’s system died with him in 1962, as did the striking contrast in style between Melbourne and Sydney philosophy. With the expansion of universities and philosophy departments, the metaphysical emphasis of Sydney and the analytical professionalism of Melbourne merged in a technique that had no particular regional significance, even when some of its concerns were distinctive. Among these was the phenomenon known as Australian Materialism, associated principally with J.J.C. Smart and David Armstrong. This continued the metaphysical orientation of so much Australian philosophy, though deploying the analytical and argumentative skills by then common to English-speaking philosophy anywhere. Much of the passion surrounding the materialism debates of the 1960s and 1970s, involving the pros and cons of ‘the scientific world view’ and its reductionist enthusiasms, dissipated into broader metaphysical and psychological interests such as the discussion of universals and laws, realism versus antirealism, the ontology of space and time, and the status and pretensions of cognitive science.
         There remains important work that is somewhat independent, even occasionally sceptical, of these metaphysical directions: work in epistemology, philosophical psychology, history of philosophy, and value theory. In pure value theory, there has been little home-grown work that is highly original though there have been many solid contributions by Australian philosophers to international debates, and Peter Singer is famous beyond philosophical circles for his theorizing of ‘animal liberation’ and opposition to ‘sanctity of human life’ outlooks in bioethics. The general tenor of Australian philosophy remains resolutely ‘analytical’ though there is a significant minority interest in ‘continental’ philosophy and some efforts to reach a modus vivendi between the two. Until late in the twentieth century, women played no prominent role, but women philosophers and feminist philosophy have become increasingly significant and, although many find the ‘continental’ mode congenial to their approach, there is strong representation of the more ‘analytic’ tradition. Another prominent emphasis has been environmental philosophy which incorporates the traditional interest in metaphysics but with a less reductive touch than has been characteristic of the mainstream."
10.4324/9780415249126-n017-1,Ecological philosophy,"In the early 1970s a small number of academic philosophers in the English-speaking world began to turn their attention to questions concerning the natural environment. Environmental philosophy initially encompassed various types of inquiry, including applied ethics oriented to issues such as nuclear power and the deployment of toxic chemicals; more abstract extrapolations of traditional ethical theories, such as Kantianism and utilitarianism, into environmental contexts; and, also, a far more radical project involving the reappraisal of basic presuppositions of Western thought in the light of their implications for our relation to the natural world. The first two were basically extensions of existing areas of philosophy, and it is arguably the third project – often described as ’ecological philosophy’ or ’ecophilosophy’ – which constitutes a distinctively new branch of philosophy. It is to environmental philosophy in this third sense that the present entry is devoted.
         Although the ecophilosophical project was explicitly normative in intent, it was quickly found to entail far-reaching investigations into the fundamental nature of the world. Indeed it was seen by many as entailing a search for an entirely new ecological paradigm – a worldview organized around a principle of interconnectedness, with transformative implications for metaphysics, epistemology, spirituality and politics, as well as ethics. Moreover, the process of elaborating a new ecological view of the world was found to uncover the contours of an already deeply embedded worldview, organized around a principle of separation or division, underlying and shaping the traditional streams of modern Western thought."
10.4324/9780415249126-q002-1,"Archaeology, philosophy of","Questions about the scientific status of archaeology have been central to field-defining debates since the late nineteenth century and have frequently involved appeals to philosophical sources. With the possible exception of Collingwood, however, there was little systematic exploration of the bearing of philosophical literature on these questions until the advent, in the 1960s and 1970s, of the New Archaeology, a self-consciously positivist research programme. The New Archaeology originated in North America but has been widely influential, especially in giving prominence to philosophical and theoretical issues. The New Archaeologists’ advocacy of a positivist (Hempelian) conception of scientific goals and practice provoked intense debate which involved philosophers of science as well as archaeologists from the early 1970s. Although the positivist commitments of the programme were widely repudiated a decade later, philosophical exchange has continued and expanded to include consideration of a range of post-positivist models of scientific inference that emphasize the theory-ladeness of archaeological evidence, as well as hermeneutic and post-structuralist models of archaeological interpretation. The analysis of epistemological issues is also closely tied to foundational questions about how the cultural subject of archaeological inquiry should be conceptualized and has led, increasingly, to a consideration of normative questions about the values and interests that shape archaeological research and the ethical responsibilities of practitioners. In 1992 Embree argued that work in this area had achieved sufficient maturity to be recognized as a subfield which he designated ‘meta-archaeology’."
10.4324/9780415249126-q063-1,Marxist philosophy of science,"Marx’s approach to science is an intriguing combination of respect for the natural sciences and empirical inquiry, determination to go beyond the description of regularities among observable phenomena, and insistence on the inevitable impact of social circumstances on scientific inquiry. Marx thought that the human sciences and the natural sciences are governed by essentially the same methods, that natural-scientific theories give us enhanced insight into mind-independent reality, and that our most fundamental views are subject to revision through scientific inquiry. Yet Marx rejected the ideal of scientific method according to which rational scientific belief is tied to observational data through a canon of rules as general, timeless and complete as the rules of logical deduction. While traditional empiricists emphasize the economical description of empirical regularities which could, in principle, be used to predict the occurrence of observable phenomena, Marx emphasizes the description of underlying causal structures, employing concepts that are typically irreducible to the vocabulary of mere observation, and causal hypotheses that sometimes do not even sketch means of prediction. Similarly, though Marx shared the optimistic view that science gives rise to long-term improvement in our insight into underlying causes, he disagreed with many epistemic optimists in his insistence that scientific inquiry is inevitably and deeply affected by social interests and relations of social power.
         Since Marx’s general comments on scientific method are few and scattered, a ‘Marxist philosophy of science’ consists of the further development of this intriguing mixture."
10.4324/9780415249126-q079-1,"Science, 19th century philosophy of","In the nineteenth century, science was organized, it tested and confirmed positive knowledge of the natural world and achieved remarkable theoretical development and hitherto unimagined practical application. Science drove industry and free enterprise, and became a powerful catalyst in the battle between defenders of knowledge as power and advocates of knowledge as love.
         Fruitful scientific theories and observations were plentiful. Darwin, Wallace and Spencer caused a revolution in biology. Faraday, Maxwell and Hertz contributed seminal ideas in electromagnetic theory. Hermann von Helmholtz studied the physiology of tones and discovered a principle of the conservation of force. Lyell’s efforts established geology as a science. Ernst Mach argued for the elimination of absolute space in favour of a space and time consisting of observable relations between things, thus providing incentive for Einstein’s theory of relativity. Sir John Herschel added many observed double stars to the growing catalogue of celestial bodies.
         These and other observational, theoretical and applied achievements in nineteenth-century science were replete with philosophical consequences. Until the nineteenth century natural philosophy and science coexisted as a single discipline. Now science and traditional philosophy drew apart. Some held that henceforth science would deal with the world revealed in experience, and philosophy with the world existing (if any does) beyond what we experience. Others (including prominent scientists) were unwilling to yield to philosophy licence to speculate beyond the limits of what could be ascertained by means of observation and experimentation: even if science and philosophy were no longer one unified intellectual enterprise, philosophy had a substantial role to play in philosophizing about science.
         To satisfy changing expectations, a new intellectual discipline was created in the nineteenth century: the philosophy of science. Unlike previous philosophy, whose subject matter was everything that is (or is not), the philosophy of science had a distinct and determinate subject matter: theoretical texts and experimental and observational reports of scientists (the word ‘scientist’ having been invented by William Whewell).
         Theoretical scientific systems and their logical structure were one focus of attention. Science was also said to discover laws. Were such laws timeless and exceptionless truths about nature, or simply convenient, economical ways of cataloguing information? These laws were discovered (or invented) generalizations that provided tested information about nature. This discovery and confirmation relied upon the method of induction – thought by most nineteenth-century philosophers of science to have a logic – to involve decisions concerning the validity or invalidity of inferences based on knowledge from experience. Was this alleged logic trustworthy? These questions exemplify the complex problems concerning the epistemic reliability of scientific explanation."
10.4324/9780415249126-q141-1,"Mechanism, in modern philosophy","Mechanism is the view that the material world is composed of small particles (corpuscles, or atoms), whose motion, size, shape, and various arrangements and clusterings provide the theoretical background for the explanation of all happenings in the physical universe. Early modern authors, whether mechanists or not, assumed that the matter composing these particles was one and the same throughout the universe. With very few exceptions, they also assumed that there were immaterial entities such as human minds (or souls) and angels.
         This view, which became the dominant one during the seventeenth century, had earlier precursors, both in classical times and in the Renaissance period, but the major earlier view, following Aristotle, explained the behaviour of material things in virtue of their form or nature: snow was white because it was the kind of thing that was white: it was the nature of snow to be white.
         By this ‘way of dispatching difficulties, they make it very easy to solve All the Phænomena of Nature in Generall, but make men think it impossible to explicate almost Any of them in Particular’, said Robert Boyle, adding that it was only the ‘Comprehensive Principles of the Corpuscularian Philosophy’ which would allow unmysterious explanations of physical phenomena (Boyle 1999, 5: 300–1).
         However, many of the things mechanism was invoked to explain – gravity and magnetism, for example – remained inexplicable on simple mechanistic accounts. Nonetheless, one important and lasting result of ‘the mechanical philosophy’ was the acceptance of the requirement that all explanations be understandable, that is, explicable in terms of elementary particles and their motion. In the hands of thinkers such as Galileo, Descartes, Boyle, and Newton this led to a reliance on experience and experiment, often controlled and quantified experiments, in place of the older, Aristotelian, model which viewed science as involving the deduction of necessary, universal, truths, from premises which were themselves necessary."
10.4324/9780415249126-s086-1,Postmodernism and political philosophy,"Just as there is much disagreement over both what is meant by ‘postmodernism’ and which thinkers fall under this rubric, so also is there disagreement over its implications for political philosophy. The claim of postmodernists that raises the most significant issues is that Western modernity’s fundamental moral and political concepts function in such a way as to marginalize, denigrate and discipline ‘others’; that is, categories of people who in some way are found not to measure up to prevailing criteria of rationality, normality and responsibility, and so on. The West’s generally self-congratulatory attitude towards liberal democracy and its traditions obscures this dynamic. Postmodernism aims to disrupt this attitude, and its proponents typically see their efforts as crucial to a radicalization of democracy."
10.4324/9780415249126-u058-1,"Language, ancient philosophy of","The earliest interest in language during the ancient Greek period was largely instrumental: presumed facts about language and its features were pressed into service for the purpose of philosophical argumentation. Perhaps inevitably, this activity gave way to the analysis of language for its own sake. Claims, for example, about the relation between the semantic values of general terms and the existence of universals invited independent inquiry into the nature of the meanings of those general terms themselves. Language thus became an object of philosophical inquiry in its own right. Accordingly, philosophers at least from the time of Plato conducted inquiries proper to philosophy of language. They investigated:
         - how words acquire their semantic values;
         - how proper names and other singular terms refer;
         - how words combine to form larger semantic units;
         - the compositional principles necessary for language understanding;
         - how sentences, statements, or propositions come to be truth-evaluable;
         and, among later figures of the classical period,
         - (6) how propositions, as abstract, mind- and language-independent entities, are to be (a) characterized in terms of their constituents, (b) related to minds and the natural languages used to express them, and (c) related to the language-independent world."
10.4324/9780415249126-u037-1,"Language, early modern philosophy of","Philosophical interest in language during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was strong but largely derivative. Most thinkers shared Leibniz’s view ‘that languages are the best mirror of the human mind, and that a precise analysis of the significations of words would tell us more than anything else about the operations of the understanding’.
         The three most important areas of philosophical discussion about language in the modern period were the nature of signification, the origin of human language and the possibility of animal language. Signification was generally viewed as a relation between linguistic signs and ideas. There was no agreement whether signification is entirely conventional or contains a natural element, but the view is that it is entirely natural virtually disappeared. Even those who retained the belief in the possibility of a philosophically perfect language insisted that such a language should be constructed anew, rather than rediscovered as the lost language of Adam. The traditional biblical account of the origin of language was more and more contested but, as more naturalistic theories emerged, the problem of why other animals cannot talk became especially pressing.
         Debates about language in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were highly speculative; participants in these debates often relied on simplistic biological theories, inadequate grammars or anecdotal evidence from travellers. What makes these discussions important is less their scientific contribution than their engagement with the philosophical problems concerning the relationship between the human mind and the natural world."
10.4324/9780415249126-n010-1,"Czech Republic, philosophy in","The foundation of the University of Prague in 1348 contributed significantly to establishing Bohemia as a centre of philosophical thought. The main philosophers and theologians from the University favoured the Platonic tradition, and from this position they criticised corruption in the Church. The most important representative of this trend was Jan Hus who followed the teaching of John Wyclif in the spirit of rationalism and humanism. His ideas became an ideological base for the anti-feudal Hussite Revolution in the fifteenth century and the later Czech Reformation. Theoreticians on the extreme wing of the Revolution held a natural worldview, opposing the notion of transcendence. Social thinking in this era found expression in Petr Chelčický, who preached a strict pacifism and a classless society. The Revolution broke the power of the Church’s ideological monopoly, and had a positive impact on the development of Czech society for the following two centuries. The atmosphere of relative tolerance allowed Renaissance thinking and Czech Reformation rationalism and humanism to enrich each other. This tradition culminated in the work of Jan Amos Comenius, who aimed to improve social relations through rational enlightenment and education, promoting harmony and justice for the development of all humankind.
         After 1620, Czech spiritual life was paralysed for many centuries by a forced anti-Reformation and the emigration of many of the country’s leading intellectuals. A revival started only at the end of the eighteenth century. František Palacký, inspired by the neohumanism of his era and by the Czech Reformation, formed a new philosophy of Czech history. B. Bolzano achieved impressive results in philosophy of science and logic, while A. Smetana created an independent variant of the philosophy of identity. In the second half of the nineteenth century Herbartism became very influential, contributing to social psychology and aesthetics.
         The most important representative of modern Czech thinking is T.G. Masaryk, creator of a philosophical concept of democracy understood in the context of a humanistic world view. Masaryk’s philosophy has been followed by many philosophers and theologians in the twentieth century. In the period between the wars, important concepts based on structuralism were created by J.L. Fischer (philosophy, sociology), J. Mukařovský (aesthetics), V. Příhoda (psychology, pedagogy), and many linguists. J. Patočka contributed to the development of phenomenology with his concept of the natural world. In opposition to ‘school’ philosophy L.Klíma preached extreme subjectivism and individualism. Non-dogmatic Marxists wrote internationally regarded works. Well known in analytical philosophy and modern logic are the achievements of L. Tondl, O. Weinberger, K. Teige, R.Kalivoda and K. Kosík and P. Tichý."
10.4324/9780415249126-e083-1,Russian philosophy of law,"Russian thought is rarely associated with philosophy of law. The intellectuals of pre-revolutionary Russia are known rather for their uncompromising critique of legalism, passing sometimes into a genuine ‘legal nihilism’. Indeed, both right-wing and left-wing Russian thinkers – the Slavophiles and Dostoevskii on the one hand, the populists and anarchists (from Bakunin to Tolstoi) on the other – saw modern rational law as an instrument of egoistic bourgeois individualism, destroying the values of communal collectivism still preserved among the Russian peasantry. This attitude found expression not only in different forms of programmatic anti-capitalism but also in a tendency to discredit civil rights and political liberty as a mere mask for capitalist exploitation. Capitalist development and the juridicization of social bonds it involved were perceived as something peculiar to the West, coming to Russia from without and as such not worthy of acceptance. Law and legal rights were criticized in Russia from many quarters and for various reasons: in defence of an idealized autocracy or in defence of true freedom, on behalf of the Russian soul or on behalf of universal progress towards socialism, in the name of Christ or in the name of Marx. In this manner right-wing and left-wing Russian intellectuals supported one another in creating a peculiar tradition of the censure of law.
         However, it would be wrong to draw from these facts a conclusion of an inherent hostility between the ‘Russian mind’ and the ‘spirit of law’. The ‘juridical world-view’ of the Enlightenment was well represented in imperial Russia. The modernizing Russian autocrats – Peter the Great and Catherine the Great – believed firmly in the power of rational legislation and won admiration from among leading European thinkers (Leibniz, Voltaire, Diderot) fir setting a good example for Western monarchs. The first radical critic of Russian autocracy, Aleksandr Radishchev (1749–1802), was in turn a theorist of natural law, a firm believer in inalienable human rights, and an enthusiastic worshipper of the American constitution. Under the reign of Alexander I (1801–25), who himself thought seriously about the introduction of constitutional rule in Russia, admiration for law was very strong among Russia’s intellectual elite. Radischchev’s disciples, Ivan Pnin and Vasilii Popugaev, inspired also by the Scottish Enlightenment, advocated the idea of a ‘civil society’ with a developed system of private law and legally safeguarded human rights. Nikita Murav’ev and Pavel Pestel, ideological leaders of the two trends within the Decembrist movement (named so after the abortive uprising of December l825), expressed their ideas in the form of detailed constitutional projects. A common feature of these projects, otherwise very different, was a pronounced juridical rationalism, sharply contrasting with all variants of a sceptical attitude towards law."
10.4324/9780415249126-g004-1,Neo-Confucian philosophy,"Chinese neo-Confucian philosophy, or ‘neo-Confucianism’, is a term which refers to a wide variety of substantially different Chinese thinkers from the Song dynasty (960–1279) through the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). In at least one respect the term is misleading, for unlike Neoplatonists, most neo-Confucians saw themselves as reviving, not revising, the earlier Confucian tradition. What united all these thinkers was a common allegiance to Confucius and his thought. Many of the central debates within the tradition concern the issue of who could claim to be Confucius’ legitimate heir.
         Despite their shared dedication to Confucius’ legacy, a number of the central beliefs of neo-Confucians were unknown to Confucius and his early followers and appear to be at odds with early Confucian views. Many of these beliefs were part of a novel, elaborate and comprehensive metaphysical scheme linking human beings (as microcosm) to the universe (as macrocosm). Such cosmological theories provided a new ground for Confucian ethical claims and strengthened a tendency towards the mystical identification of the self with the universe. These changes also helped to transform the earlier Confucian concern with self-cultivation and steady moral improvement to a more dramatic quest for spiritual enlightenment, replete with a distinctly Confucian style of meditation.
         One widely accepted account of the rise of neo-Confucianism sees it as a reaction on the part of Confucian scholars to the perceived dominance of Buddhist thought. On this view, Confucians had become complacent in the period between the end of the Han dynasty, in the early third century ad, to the beginnings of the neo-Confucian movement late in the ninth century. Fearing that their way of life was in peril, these later Confucians resolved to overcome their Buddhist competitors and revive their tradition. Purportedly, these later Confucians realized that in order to accomplish these goals they would need to develop and deploy an account of the Confucian tradition that could compete with and overcome the complex metaphysical schemes the Buddhists had used to argue against them. For these strategic reasons, early neo-Confucians focused their attention on texts like the Mengzi (Mencius), Daxue (Great Learning) and Zhongyong (Doctrine of the Mean) and began to evolve a version of Confucianism that was supported by the kind of comprehensive and complex metaphysical system described above.
         A different account of the rise of neo-Confucianism can be given, however, in which the selection of certain texts and the development of new styles and practices of reasoning are not seen as self-conscious strategic borrowings from Buddhism and Daoism. Rather, these characteristic features of neo-Confucianism are consequences of the profound and pervasive effect that Buddhist and Daoist thought had exerted for centuries upon Chinese intellectuals. There was no organized or distinct group of thinkers who identified and thought of themselves as Confucians in the centuries immediately prior to the neo-Confucian revival. Rather, Chinese intellectuals had come to accept a wide range of philosophical ideas and spiritual practices as part and parcel of literati culture. When certain of these broadly read and eclectically trained individuals began looking back to the writings of early Confucian figures, they did so through the categories and with the concerns and approaches of their age. Their angle of vision had changed, and as a result they saw these earlier sources differently. This new orientation led them to elevate certain texts to canonical status; in some cases, these were texts that were unknown to the sages they claimed to follow. Moreover, these later Confucians developed particular aspects of the classical writings in ways that would have been unrecognizable to the founding figures of the tradition they so adamantly defended.
         The great impetus for the revival of Confucianism came with a series of social and political crises that came to a head roughly in the middle of the eighth century. Under the dual pressures of internal rebellion and economic distress and external attack on a number of different fronts, Chinese intellectuals began to question their fundamental beliefs and practices. Rather than calling for reform or progress, such reflection led them back to their roots. Increasingly, they came to believe that the primary source of their troubles was that they had lost their Way. Like the foreign enemies who plagued them from without, they were being undermined by a foreign force from within: the non-Chinese religion of Buddhism and its spiritual cousin Daoism. These had led them to abandon the true source of their strength and former glory: the culture of classical China. Their course was clear. They must retrieve and revive the classical culture that was their very essence. In so doing they would replay the roles their most revered sages, Confucius and Mencius, had played in their own degenerate ages. This call to defend and promote ‘this culture’ served as the rallying point for the neo-Confucian movement.
         Towards the end of the neo-Confucian period, Chinese Confucians themselves began to recognize the degree to which earlier neo-Confucians had incorporated beliefs and styles of reasoning that were alien to Confucius’ way of thinking, specifically ideas drawn from Buddhism and Daoism, into the tradition. A number of these Qing dynasty thinkers saw their task primarily in terms of purging the tradition of these foreign elements in an effort to reconstitute a purer form of Confucius’ original vision."
10.4324/9780415249126-a136-1,Innateness in ancient philosophy,"The idea that knowledge exists latently in the mind, independently of sense experience, is put forward in three of Plato’s dialogues: the Meno, the Phaedo and the Phaedrus. The claim is that the human soul exists before it enters a body, and that in its pre-existent state it knows certain things, which it forgets at birth. What we call ‘learning’ during our mortal lives is in fact nothing but the recollection of pre-existent knowledge. In a particularly famous passage in the dialogue the Meno, the character Socrates sets an uneducated slave boy a geometrical puzzle. After asking a series of questions, he elicits the correct answer from the boy, which he claims existed in him all along, merely needing to be aroused by the process of recollection. Aristotle dismisses recollection quite brusquely and tries to explain human learning by appeal to sense perception. In post-Aristotelian philosophy, it unclear how far any theory of innateness was accepted. Most probably, the Stoics thought that in some sense moral concepts and beliefs arise from human nature, though they did not endorse a theory of pre-existence or recollection."
10.4324/9780415249126-da085-1,"Aesthetics, in modern philosophy","The term aesthetics is derived linguistically from the Greek term meaning sensitive or sentient. It is first used to designate a particular area of philosophical inquiry in mid-eighteenth-century Germany, though the intellectual origins of the discipline trace to earlier French and British writers, with the latter providing many founding texts of the emerging area of study. The new subject matter was distinguished by its rise coeval with the Continental Enlightenment and a focus on philosophical issues surrounding the fine arts and judgements of value captured by concepts of beauty, sublimity, and their relata.
         In France, the seventeenth-century tradition of criticism divides into two strands of thought: one influenced directly by Cartesian rationalism, the other modified by principles drawn from British empiricism. German contributions to aesthetics develop within a rationalist framework derived from Leibnizian philosophy and marked an effort to systematize the newly articulated domain of knowledge. British writers follow primarily empiricist principles but fall into three groups depending on whether they emphasize an internal sense, the faculty of imagination, or psychological processes of association. The British aesthetic tradition is also distinguished by debates over the picturesque, an aesthetic drawn from landscape painting and inseparable from the history of English landscape gardening."
10.4324/9780415249126-dd074-1,"Ordinary language philosophy, school of","The label ‘ordinary language philosophy’ was more often used by the enemies than by the alleged practitioners of what it was intended to designate. It was supposed to identify a certain kind of philosophy that flourished, mainly in Britain and therein mainly in Oxford, for twenty years or so, roughly after 1945. Its enemies found it convenient to group the objects of their hostility under a single name, while the practitioners thus aimed at were more conscious of divergences among themselves, and of the actual paucity of shared philosophical doctrine; they might have admitted to being a ‘group’ perhaps, but scarcely a ‘school’. The sharp hostility which this group aroused was of two quite different sorts. On the one hand, among certain (usually older) philosophers and more commonly among the serious-minded public, it was labelled as philistine, subversive, parochial and even deliberately trivial; on the other hand, some philosophers (for instance, Russell, Popper and Ayer), while ready enough to concede the importance in philosophy of language, saw a concern with ordinary language in particular as a silly aberration, or even as a perversion and betrayal of modern work in the subject.
         How, then, did ‘ordinary language’ come in? It was partly a matter of style. Those taken to belong to the school were consciously hostile to the lofty, loose rhetoric of old-fashioned idealism; also to the ‘deep’ paradoxes and mystery-mongering of their continental contemporaries; but also to any kind of academic jargon and neologism, to technical terms and aspirations to ‘scientific’ professionalism. They preferred to use, not necessarily without wit or elegance, ordinary language. (Here G.E. Moore was an important predecessor.) Besides style, however, there were also relevant doctrines, though less generally shared. Wittgenstein, perhaps the most revered philosopher of the period, went so far as to suggest that philosophical problems in general actually consisted in, or arose from, distortions and misunderstandings of ordinary language, a ‘clear view’ of which would accomplish their dissolution; many agreed that there was some truth in this, though probably not the whole truth. Then it was widely held that ordinary language was inevitably fundamental to all our intellectual endeavours– it must be what one starts from, supplying the familiar background and terms in which technical sophistications have to be introduced and understood; it was therefore not to be neglected or carelessly handled. Again it was urged, notably by J.L. Austin, that our inherited everyday language is, at least in many areas, a long-evolved, complex and subtle instrument, careful scrutiny of which could be expected to be at least a helpful beginning in the pursuit of philosophical clarity. It was probably this modest claim– overstated and even caricatured by its detractors– which was most frequently supposed to be the credo of ordinary language philosophers. It was important that Russell – like, indeed, Wittgenstein when composing his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1922) – firmly believed, on the contrary, that ordinary language was the mere primitive, confused and confusing surface beneath which theorists were to seek the proper forms of both language and logic."
10.4324/9780415249126-h011-1,Greek philosophy: impact on Islamic philosophy,"During the Hellenistic period (323–43 bc), classical Greek philosophy underwent a radical transformation. From being an essentially Greek product, it developed into a cosmopolitan and eclectic cultural movement in which Greek, Egyptian, Phoenician and other Near Eastern religious and ethical elements coalesced. This transformation is best symbolized by the role Alexandria played as the hub of diverse currents of thought making up the new philosophy.
         When the Abbasid Caliphate was founded in Baghdad in 750 ad, the centre of learning gradually moved to the Abbasid capital, which became in due course the heir of Athens and Alexandria as the new cultural metropolis of the medieval world. About two centuries later Cordoba, capital of Muslim Spain, began to vie with Baghdad as the centre of ‘ancient learning’. From Cordoba, Greek–Arabic philosophy and science were transmitted across the Pyrenees to Paris, Bologna and Oxford in the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries.
         The initial reception of Greek–Hellenistic philosophy in the Islamic world was mixed. It was frowned upon at first as being suspiciously foreign or pagan, and was dismissed by conservative theologians, legal scholars and grammarians as pernicious or superfluous. By the middle of the eighth century ad the picture had changed somewhat, with the appearance of the rationalist theologians of Islam known as the Mu‘tazilites, who were thoroughly influenced by the methods of discourse or dialectic favoured by the Muslim philosophers. Of those philosophers, the two outstanding figures of the ninth and tenth centuries were al-Kindi and al-Razi, who hailed Greek philosophy as a form of liberation from the shackles of dogma or blind imitation (taqlid). For al-Kindi, the goals of philosophy are perfectly compatible with those of religion, and, for al-Razi, philosophy was the highest expression of man’s intellectual ambitions and the noblest achievement of that noble people, the Greeks, who were unsurpassed in their quest for wisdom (hikma)."
10.4324/9780415249126-h018-1,Ethics in Islamic philosophy,"The study of Islamic ethics, whether philosophical or theological, grew out of early discussions of the questions of predetermination (qadar), obligation (taklif) and the injustices of temporal rulers, particularly the caliphs. Early writers on ethics from the Mu‘tazila school were probably influenced by Greek philosophy. By the third century AH (ninth century ad) a clearly discernible current of philosophical ethics began to take shape, with strong influences from Greek ethics including Stoicism, Platonism and Aristotelianism.
         Al-Kindi, the first genuine philosopher of Islam, appears from his extant ethical writings to have been particularly influenced by Socrates and Diogenes the Cynic. Other classical influences can be seen in the work of Platonists such as Abu Bakr al-Razi, who followed Plato’s division of the parts of the souls, and Neoplatonists such as al-Farabi, while Aristotelian influences can be seen in al-Farabi, who also discussed the problem of evil, Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd. Ibn Sina developed a theory of the conjunction of the soul with the active intellect; with this conjunction is bound up the ultimate perfection of the soul which has attained the highest degree of wisdom and virtue.
         Neoplatonism again surfaces in the work of Ibn Miskawayh and his followers, to whom we owe the groundwork of a whole ethical tradition which flourished in Persia well into the twelfth century AH (eighteenth century ad) and beyond. Onto Plato’s threefold division of the soul, Ibn Miskawayh grafts a threefold division of virtue into wisdom, courage and temperance. His views were elaborated upon by al-Tusi and al-Dawwani, among others. A blend of philosophical and religious ethics is characteristic of the work of some later writers such as al-Ghazali and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, in which the road to moral and spiritual perfection has mystical overtones."
10.18806/tesl.v35i1.1283,Recurring Topics in English Language Teachers' Written Teaching Philosophy Statements,"The present study analyzed in-service English as an additional language (EAL) teachers’ written teaching philosophy (TP) statements in order to identify the dominant topics that comprise this supporting genre, as well as the use of personal pronouns and possessive adjectives. The sample included 27 in-service EAL teachers’ TPs who were currently teaching, primarily, in the context of higher education and intensive English programs in North American settings. Each sentence was coded for a dominant topic, leading to the creation of 24 categories. To capture the unique characteristics of this genre, we created three success groups (i.e., Most successful, Successful, and Least successful) and compared their contents. Moreover, the first and last five topics for each TP for the three groups were compared, thus, establishing a pattern of opening and closing topics. Finally, we drew on corpus tools to uncover the manipulation of specific lexical features of this genre: the use of personal pronouns and possessive adjectives. The most prominent topics across the three groups included Teaching beliefs, Learning beliefs, Beliefs about learners, and Teacher growth. Differences were identified between the three groups in terms of both topics and organization.&#x0D;
La présente étude a analysé des énoncés écrits de professeurs d’anglais langue additionnelle (ALA) en poste décrivant leur philosophie pédagogique (PP) en vue d’identifier les thèmes dominants qui composent ce genre complémentaire ainsi que l’utilisation de pronoms personnels et d’adjectifs possessifs. L’échantillon portait sur la philosophie pédagogique de 27 professeurs d’ALA en poste présentement actifs, et ce, principalement dans le contexte de l’enseignement supérieur et des programmes d’anglais intensif dans des milieux nord-américains. Chaque phrase a été codifiée en fonction de son thème dominant, ce qui a amené la création de 24 catégories. Afin de saisir les caractéristiques particulières de ce genre, nous avons créé trois catégories de succès (c.-à-d. Succès supérieur, Succès, et Succès inférieur) et en avons comparé les contenus. De plus, les premiers et cinq derniers thèmes des trois groupes portant sur chaque PP ont été comparés, ce qui a permis d’établir un schéma de thèmes d’ouverture et de fermeture. Enfin, nous avons recouru à des outils de corpus textuel pour découvrir la manipulation des caractéristiques linguistiques particulières de ce genre : l’utilisation de pronoms personnels et d’adjectifs possessifs. Les thèmes les plus importants dans les trois groupes étaient les Croyances sur l’enseignement, les Croyances sur l’apprentissage, les Croyances sur les apprenants, et le Perfectionnement professionnel des professeurs. Des différences ont été identifiées entre les trois groupes tant au niveau des thèmes qu’à celui de l’organisation."

Scholars seek to understand the teacher PD process, while practitioners are interested in deriving policies to facilitate teacher PD. The consensus emerging from the pool of literature is that teacher PD should be “individualized”: more focused on fostering teachers’ personal growth instead of enforcing “standard practices”. The Anglosphere has been leading in the domain of teacher PD, causing many regions to imitate its practices. Using documentary analysis, this paper reviews teacher PD policies in Hong Kong over the past forty years and compares them with practices typically adopted in the Anglosphere. The paper suggests that the PD policies of Hong Kong progressed from ‘solely teacher training’, to ‘emphasis on generic skills’, to ‘lifelong learning’. The concept of ‘Confucian Heritage Culture’ is used to explain the differences between the Angloshpere and Hong Kong in terms of PD practices. Implications for adapting teacher PD practices cross-culturally are discussed."

10.26686/pq.v7i2.4378, Is income inequality unjust? Perspectives from political philosophy,"Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett have argued recently (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2010) that income inequality produces many kinds of social and health problems in rich countries.1 High rates of infant mortality, teenage births, crime and obesity, educational under-achievement, low life expectancy, social mobility and many other social problems are worse, they claim, in more unequal societies. They further argue that these problems are caused not by absolute deprivation (poverty) but by relative deprivation, and that they are best addressed by compressing the income distribution, even if this means slowing or entirely stopping economic growth. Moreover, their argument has the further implication that more could be done for underprivileged groups in society by reducing the gap between the rich and the poor than by investing more resources in public services."
10.1891/jcop.19.2.187.66795,Response to Ellis’ Discussion of “Science and Philosophy: Comparison of Cognitive Therapy and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy”,"These authors appreciate Ellis’ clarification that he encourages REBT therapists to use many of the same principles and methods used by CT therapists. His assertions that many of these elements are done more frequently or thoroughly in REBT than in CT are best evaluated by objective observers via empirical analysis of therapy transcripts, session videotapes, and treatment manuals. Such research would have particular value if it linked therapy methods with treatment outcome and relapse prevention for particular problems. In this regard, Ellis’ recommendation that REBT become more empirical is welcome. Also, these authors clarify the distinction they make between the terms philosophical and philosophically-based; empirically responsive and empirically-based. Finally, the authors applaud Ellis’ major contributions to the field."

Three of the major irrational thought processes hypothesized by RET to be at the core of psychopathology are shown to also be inconsistent with Judeo-Christian philosophy. Therefore, it is postulated that disputing irrational beliefs and establishing more rational philosophies is also consistent with Judeo-Christian philosophy. Specific clinical strategies are suggested for working with religious clients in changing these three irrational beliefs."

10.1017/jie.2018.14,‘No Shame at AIME’: Listening to Aboriginal Philosophy and Methodologies to Theorise Shame in Educational Contexts,"Shame is a ‘slippery’ concept in educational contexts but by listening to Aboriginal philosophy and Country, we can rethink its slipperiness. This article contemplates how multiple understandings of shame are derived from and coexist within colonised educational contexts. We focus on one positive example of Indigenous education to consider how these understandings can be challenged and transformed for the benefit of Indigenous learners. We discuss a mentoring program run by and for Indigenous young people that is successfully impacting school retention and completion rates: The Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience (AIME). AIME has a rule, ‘No Shame at AIME’, with the view to minimising shame as a barrier to engaging with Western education. But is this as beneficial as might first appear? Might this erode important cultural understandings of shame necessary in Indigenous education? Instead, could shame be repositioned to better align with original cultural meanings and purposes? We philosophise about the AIME rule with Yuin Country and stories from Country along with our observational and interview data. We argue AIME does not so much ‘remove’ shame as reposition it to better align with Aboriginal cultural educational practice, which positively impacts mentees."
10.1891/1541-6577.27.2.88,Constructivist Philosophy and Nursing Student Medication Calculations,"Prelicensure nursing students often have difficulty performing medication calculations (MCs). Faculty at one baccalaureate nursing program wanted to use nursing theory to guide the development of a teaching–learning approach related to MC’s. Finding little theory related to the topic of MCs, a constructivist-based teaching–learning approach was used instead. The purpose of the study was to assess whether nursing students who received an MC review class that used a teaching–learning approach based on constructivist philosophy had better results on an MC examination than students who received their review via traditional teaching–learning methods. The study participants consisted of two cohorts of first-semester junior-level nursing students from one university-based school of nursing in the Midwestern United States. The results indicated that students in the simulation review class had higher mean scores on an MC examination than students who received their review via more traditional means. Teaching–learning strategies related to MCs based on constructivist philosophy have the potential to improve student learning outcomes, but more research is needed before middle-range theory related to this critically important area of nursing education can be developed."

Of course there may be more than one, but in all circumstances there is at least one."
10.1017/s0084255900017691,In Defense of American Philosophy,"Ernest Gellner's ""Reflections on Philosophy, Especially in America"" in the June Worldview contains so many perceptive and challenging statements that it merits a reply. It is also sufficiently confused and dubious in its conclusions as to require criticism. As a teacher of philosophy for over two decades, I am concerned about philosophy's role in contemporary and national life, and hence I am stimulated to make the following points.What is the essence of Professor Gellner's assessment?"

AD. 150We live in a curious time. We are agreed that our educational and university system has been increasingly dominated for the past half century by a pseudoscientific philosophy that doubted on principle the validity of moral values. Our constitutional system is implemented through courts managed largely by a legal profession educated in such an amoral environment that any explicit value or religious criterion is practically precluded from being taught as true."
10.1017/s0017383518000220,Philosophy,"Three recent volumes indicate a growing appreciation of the significance and complexity of Plato's account of mousikē in the Laws. Anastasia-Erasmia Peponi's edited work, Performance and Culture in Plato's Laws, collects fifteen diverse chapters by prominent scholars in Greek literature, philosophy, and culture to produce an immensely rewarding and original range of perspectives on Plato's treatment of performance and poetics in the Laws. As Peponi notes in her brief introduction, the complexity of the cultural background that Plato manipulates and appropriates in the Laws, as well as the intricacy of the Platonic appropriation itself, combine to present a very real challenge to any scholar seeking to understand them. In addition, it is hard to see that any robust treatment of the Laws’ political theory can avoid getting to grips with the fundamental connections between politics and performance established within the dialogue. Any reader with an interest in either Plato's political philosophy or his poetics will be well rewarded by time spent with this volume. The chapters are divided into four sections, which focus in turn on issues of cultural identity (‘Geopolitics of Performance’), the role of the choruses in Magnesia (‘Conceptualising Chorality’), the Laws’ treatment of genre (‘Redefining Genre’), and the later reception of the Laws’ poetics (‘Poetry and Music in the Afterlife of the Laws’). In the second of the volume's two chapters on cultural identity, Ian Rutherford considers the Laws’ representation of Egypt as a culture that successfully resists political and moral decline via a commitment to stability in mousikē. Setting Plato's account against the external evidence, Rutherford suggests that the Laws offers a partial fiction of stable Egyptian mousikē, useful not least for the implications of its possible critical connection to Dorian culture. In the last of five chapters on the Laws’ interest in the civic apparatus of choral performance, Peponi demonstrates the singularity of choral performance in the work. Whereas the Laws treats most types of performance as producing pleasure in the spectator, in the case of choruses, the emphasis is on the pleasure and experience of the performers. Peponi argues that this shift in focus represents a Platonic attempt to ‘de-aestheticize’ the chorus. In this way, Plato seeks to rehabilitate mousikē by divesting it of the psychological and aesthetic flaws identified in the Republic’s extended critique. However, as Peponi notes in conclusion, the Laws is not altogether comfortable with this sort of performative pleasure. In the first of five chapters on genre, Andrea Nightingale discusses the Laws’ manipulation of generic diversity in service of the unified truth represented by the law code at its heart. Nightingale presents a fascinating and original analysis of the law code as a written text rather different in character from that criticized in the Phaedrus as a pharmakon that destroys our memory of truth. Rather, it serves to encourage the internalization of truths by obliterating the citizens’ memories of previous unwanted cultural norms. In the volume's final chapter, Andrew Barker turns to Aristoxenus for help in making sense of Plato's suggestion that music can be assessed as ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’, or as ‘good’ or ‘bad’. Contrasting the Platonic focus on mimesis and ethical correctness with Aristoxenus’ assessment of music ‘by the standard of its own intrinsic values’ (413), Barker suggests that, of the two treatments, Plato's is the furthest removed from general Greek opinion. These varied and illuminating chapters are representative of the scope and quality of the volume, which not only serves to open up new directions for research on the Laws but also makes plain that the Laws is at least as important as the Republic for a thorough understanding of Plato's views on art and culture, and their relation to politics."
10.2478/nybj-2014-0010,The Implementation of TRM Philosophy and 5Qs Model in Higher Education - An Exploratory Investigation at a Swedish University,"Abstract
Students, their families, employers and the government want the assurance that students will get “good quality” education. The question is: what does “good quality education” mean? This paper seeks to provide the answer as well as some concrete criteria and proposals to improve the objectives and quality of the education systems. We argue in this study that the quality of higher education and student satisfaction is a cumulative construct, summing various facets and variables of the educational institution, such as technical, functional, infrastructure, interaction and atmosphere variables. In this research we describe a study involving a new instrument, i.e. the 5Qs model and a new method which assures the reasonable level of relevance, validity and reliability, while being explicitly change-oriented. The main goal of the empirical part of this study is not to evaluate the performance of the staff or to analyze the student assessment or satisfaction, rather to test the new 5Qs model. The use of the 5Q dimensions provides both a structure for designing a higher education quality measurement instrument and a framework for prioritizing results and findings."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199368815.001.0001,The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Science,"This Handbook provides the reader with access to core areas in the philosophy of science and to new directions in the discipline. Part I contains broad overviews of the main lines of research and the state of established knowledge in six principal areas of the discipline, including computational, physical, biological, psychological, and social sciences, as well as general philosophy of science. Part II covers what are considered to be the traditional topics in the philosophy of science such as causation, probability, models, ethics and values, and explanation. Part III identifies new areas of investigation that show promise of becoming important areas of research, including the philosophy of astronomy and astrophysics, data, complexity theory, neuroscience, simulations, post-Kuhnian philosophy, post-empiricist epistemology, and emergence. Most chapters are accessible to scientifically educated non-philosophers as well as to professional philosophers. The authors bring different perspectives from the North American, European, and Australasian research communities, and all are leading researchers in their fields. All the contributors were encouraged to provide a new perspective on the topic at hand in addition to providing basic information about the subject."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199368815.013.3,Advertisement for the Philosophy of the Computational Sciences,"This chapter deals with those fields that study computing systems. Among these computational sciences are computer science, computational cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. In the first part of the chapter, it is shown that there are varieties of computation, such as human computation, algorithmic machine computation, and physical computation. There are even varieties of versions of the Church-Turing thesis. The conclusion is that different computational sciences are often about different kinds of computation. The second part of the chapter discusses three specific philosophical issues. One is whether computers are natural kinds. Another issue is the nature of computational theories and explanations. The last section of the chapter relates remarkable results in computational complexity theory to problems of verification and confirmation."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199368815.013.13,Epistemology and Philosophy of Science,"In this chapter, two significant connections between epistemology and philosophy of science are discussed: approaches to knowledge in traditional epistemology and in philosophy of science, and the roles played by instruments in the production of scientific knowledge. The author considers, in particular, how these roles can be illuminated by certain forms of epistemological theorizing, such as internalism and externalism. These considerations indicate the significance that internalist and externalist considerations play in the proper formulation of suitable epistemic conditions for scientific instruments. By engaging with this aspect of epistemological reflection, philosophers of science can be provided a better account of the epistemology of instruments, which produce some of the most significant pieces of knowledge in scientific practice. The author concludes that closer connections between epistemology and philosophy of science would be beneficial to both fields."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199368815.013.36,Philosophy and Cosmology,"Cosmological questions (e.g., how far the world extends and how it all began) have occupied humans for ages and given rise to numerous conjectures, both within and outside philosophy. To put to rest fruitless speculation, Kant argued that these questions move beyond the limits of human knowledge. This article begins with Kant’s doubts about cosmology and shows that his arguments presuppose unreasonably high standards on knowledge and unwarranted assumptions about space-time. As an analysis of the foundations of twentieth-century cosmology reveals, other worries about the discipline can be avoided too if the universe is modeled using Einstein’s general theory of relativity. There is now strong observational support for one particular model. However, due to underdetermination problems, the big cosmological questions cannot be fully answered using this model either. This opens the space for more speculative proposals again (e.g., that the universe is only part of a huge multiverse)."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199368815.013.4,Philosophy of the Physical Sciences,"The authors survey some debates about the nature and structure of physical theories and about the connections between our physical theories and naturalized metaphysics. The discussion is organized around an “ideal view” of physical theories and criticisms that can be raised against it. This view includes controversial commitments regarding the best analysis of physical modalities and intertheory relations. The authors consider the case in favor of taking laws as the primary modal notion, discussing objections related to alleged violations of the laws, the apparent need to appeal to causality, and the status of probability. The “ideal view” includes a commitment that fundamental physical theories are explanatorily sufficient. The authors discuss several challenges to recovering the manifest image from fundamental physics, along with a distinct challenge to reductionism based on acknowledging the contributions of less fundamental theories in physical explanations."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199368815.013.5,Philosophy of the Psychological and Cognitive Sciences,"This chapter surveys work in philosophy of the psychological and cognitive sciences. The survey is organized by the type of task that philosophers have taken on. The author focuses on four types of task: (1) how we should interpret theories in cognitive science, (2) how we should precisify theoretical concepts in cognitive science, (3) how theories or methodologies in cognitive science cohere, and (4) how cognitive states, processes, and capacities should be individuated."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199368815.013.6,Philosophy of the Social Sciences,"Naturalism is still facing a strong opposition in the philosophy of social science from influential scholars who argue that philosophical analysis must be autonomous from scientific investigation. The opposition exploits philosophers’ traditional diffidence toward social science and fuels the ambition to provide new foundations for social research. A classic anti-naturalist strategy is to identify a feature of social reality that prevents scientific explanation and prediction. An all-time favorite is the dependence of social phenomena on human representation. This article examines two prominent versions of the dependence thesis and concludes that they both fail. Contemporary social science is capable of accounting for the causal dependence of social reality on representation, and there is no reason to believe that social entities are ontologically dependent on the collective acceptance of a constitutive rule."

In this chapter, the authors summarize some central research areas in philosophy of neuroscience. Some of these areas focus on the internal practice of neuroscience, that is, on the assumptions underlying experimental techniques, the accepted structures of explanations, the goals of integrating disciplines, and the possibility of a unified science of the mind-brain. Other areas focus outwards on the potential impact that neuroscience is having on our conception of the mind and its place in nature."

The concept and the philosophy of empowerment are discussed through a review of literature from community psychology, sociology and feminist psychology. Empowerment is connected to a resource-oriented perspective on music therapy that implies a focus upon the client's strengths and potentials and emphasizes the importance of collaboration and equality in the relationship between therapist and client."

It next presents the traditional core issues in philosophy of biology: the units of selection debate, fitness and the nature of selection, the species problem, systematics, adaptationism, and human nature. It then details some recent expansions of the field. One recent expansion has been to encompass molecular biology. Another has been to encompass ecology and conservation biology. The chapter concludes by identifying challenges at some of the field’s current frontiers: understanding the evolution of cooperation and the nature of biological individuality."

10.1017/s0003975618000127,When Philosophy Met Social Psychology,"AbstractThe Polish Peasant in Europe and America is one of the foundational works of American and world sociology, famous for its innovative qualitative methodology. Its authors proposed new theoretical ideas, including a concept of social causality and a new theory of personality combining a biologistic concept of temperament with a culturalist concept of character. Interpreters of the book still disagree about the extent of each author’s actual contribution to the work and about its scientific status in light of modern sociological theories. This article claims that to understand the book one has to take into account the previous intellectual trajectories of both authors. As a theoretical dialogue between representatives of two contrary approaches, the work may serve as an alternative to the supposed theoretical “convergence” offered two decades later by Talcott Parsons."
10.1093/oso/9780190907136.003.0005,Kant on the Way to His Own Philosophy of Logic,"This chapter considers how Kant, from the mid-1760s through the mid-1770s, navigated between existing accounts of logic before finding his own voice. It highlights two breakthroughs that would contribute most to his mature theory of logic. The first breakthrough concerns Kant’s division of logic into two essentially different though complementary branches: a logic for the learned understanding and one for the common human understanding (to make it healthy), precursors to “pure logic” and “applied logic” respectively. This distinction not only marks a clear departure from the Leibnizian-Wolffian take on the relation between artificial and natural logics, but also pays homage to the humanist and Lockean practices of emphasizing certain ethical dimensions of logic. The second breakthrough is the emergence of “transcendental logic” from Kant’s efforts to secure metaphysics—particularly the first part thereof, ontology—as a proper science."

10.31874/2309-1606-2017-21-2-46-56,Some Thoughts on Philosophy of Education,"Philosophy of education is usually understood as a special branch of philosophy. However, a noteworthy fact is that in many countries philosophy of education is not recognized as such and, consequently, is not taught in departments of philosophy, but rather in departments or faculties of education. In these cases the term “philosophy of education” is or was also used as a synonym for two things: firstly, for one of the educational sciences, and secondly, for one of the interpretations of that traditional academic discipline whose name has the same meaning and etymological origin in several languages: Pädagogik, pedagogika, pedagogija, pedagogia, pédagogie, and the like. Therefore, if we accept such interpretations, philosophy of education is not a constitutive part of philosophy. But, if it is not, then why is it called “philosophy”? And on the other hand, if philosophy of education is not the same as the history of philosophical ideas about education, if it is not just a kind of collection of what the great philosophers have said about education, then what is it?"
10.31874/2309-1606-2017-21-2-194-210,Gregory Skovoroda’s Philosophy of Education: the Difference of a Modern Vision,"The article is devoted to the analysis of the modern character of the Gregory Skovoroda’s philosophy of education. Unlike his contemporaries, he focuses on connections of philosophy and moral virtue. This position contradicts the tendency of a modern institutionalization of philosophy in the way of one more discipline of the modern research university. However, Skovoroda’s critical position does not put into question the modern content of his philosophy. On the contrary, Skovoroda’s understanding of philosophy reveals the salvific ways of its cognitive and practical rehabilitation. It is because his philosophy teaches people to be wise not only the university campus but in all spheres of their own lives. That is why he speaks not just of philosophy, but of the “philosophy of the heart”. Contrary to Christian thought, he believes that human’s transformation is possible not through faith and suffering, but through the discovery a “new body” on the ground of self-knowledge and love for oneself. Unlike the modern classical philosophy, Skovoroda considers self-knowledge, not as a function of mind alone, and the heart as a dichotomy to the mind. In accordance with contemporary educational theories based on the idea of anthropotechnical turn in philosophy, Skovoroda deems the heart an instrument for enhancing the mind. Involving the heart into the sphere of rational increases the thinking of knowledge about the specific situation of its embodiment and the cognitive capabilities of its carrier. According to Skovoroda, an important consequence of such human transformations should be the overcoming of fear and hatred of the “other”."
10.31874/2309-1606-2017-21-2-276-288,From Café-Philo – to the Horizons of Practical Philosophy,"The article is presented in the form of an interview with French philosophers André Masse-Stamberger and Olga Panchenko. It discusses the problems of practical philosophy in some communicational forms as café-philo, cinemaphilo, open conferences, philosophical consulting. The particularity of philosophical education in French universities are also covered in the paper. During the conversation, it was found that interdisciplinary connections of philosophy and psychology produce controversial opinions and require a more thorough elaboration of adjacent definitions; at the same time, it was pointed out that Oriental philosophy (and spiritual practices which are related to it) is gainingpopularity in modern Europe which gives example of a possible symbiosis of these scientific fields. The nature and key objectives of a philosophical café as an extra-academic place of philosophical practice has been discovered. Its distinctive features are an existence of a professional moderator, a strict conversational timing, a free choice of topics, an interactive discussion and a freedom of speech ina form of an equitable polylogue, a summary and an online report of activity. The Café-philo is also a process of a collegial search for the truth and an instrument of communication between intellectuals which creates a premise for further cocreation and cooperation. The opening of these discourses of practical philosophy for a wide audience demonstrates a high level of tolerance and democracy of the their members. The article identifies the philosophical aspect of masterpieces of the world cinematography that is embedded in the basis of a cinema-philo discourse in which the problems illustrated in a film are extrapolated on the topical problems of our time during its after-watching discussion. The particularity of the French educative projects of practical philosophy for children such as philosophical ateliers, meetings and discussions following the ideas of Bridgit Labbe and Oscar Brenifier have been found. Some features of the French education at universities are the following: a zero plagiarism tolerance in student texts, the priority of a deepened learning of primary sources, a multiplicity of programs, step-by-step course’ validation and a growth of a teaching in form of discussion.The main inference of the interview is the idea of a trending of practical philosophy in the existential and civilizational choice of humanity."

The practical activity of the Society includes: identifying the possibility to use the philosophy of education in formation of students' thinking in universities, exchange of views and ideas on contemporary problems of education in the region, cooperation between editors of scientific journals, organization of international scientific conferences. The author informs on the activities of the leading centers of the Society, results of international cooperation and presents the prospects of CEUPES activity."

 The paper reveals the human creative potential of philosophy, which is seen in the fact that philosophy, as “the technique of knowledge in freedom through creation of ideas”, can help the personality to master the technique of thinking and technique to be, and brings him/her into the broad contemporary context, which holds and opens the universal values and sense of humanity, comprehended in their past, present and future forms, and thus acts as a “advocate” and “therapist” of humanity. This potential of philosophy is extremely pertinent and should be actualized in the humanistic strategies of higher education in modern conditions, especially in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. But for that philosophy (and philosophers) has to prove the praxeology effectiveness of its core functions – humanistic, worldview, cultural, therapeutic and maximize its human creative potential and mission in general. That implies an update of the philosophical education."

Future engineers and even journalists live in other system of ideals. The aim of author is not reasoning in the categories «of due», but study that, why students criticize philosophy. The are two groups of critics – simpletons and non-simpletons. A simpletons criticizes because a philosopher destroys the world clarity. A non-simpletons criticizes because sometimes a philosopher teaches the dogmas. Both criticisms determine the attitude toward a deconstruction. For a philosopher it would be easier to follow the demands of the simpletons and to revive a dogma. But in this case philosophy would be converted into ideology. Therefore a philosopher must answer upon requests non-simpletons: teach (and to learn) to freedom of thinking, ability to look at the generally accepted from the unusual point of view."
10.31874/2309-1606-2017-20-1-257-268,Detonation as Grammatological Version of Philosophy Texts Reading,"In the article the J. Derrida’s deconstruction interpretation is reasoned as a detonation. The deconstructor demonstrates that the strategic inflexion in a reading should be started from the tactics of rereading of already written as a «reading in between of lines». Derrida tries to revoke a «logocentric» intonation in favour of, as he thought, «grammatological» articulation. If it was true, we dealt with a field of unbounded, undivided tonation, the every in- of which had been always abrogated beforehand. However, in fact his deconstruction gives a voice those detonations, which will hardly have it as of right. When «Of grammatology» author was deconstructing texts he reread, he proceeded from «really obvious» in-tonation (there was supposed that the whole “logocentric” epoch was tuned on it), and aspired to interpret unheard before de-tonations instead of to balance in a field of tonation. It means his focal point is detonation (dispersion, scattering, burst etc.). As a result, «detonational processes» were activated in his own text too. Grammatological version of philosophy texts reading (detonation) is extrapolated on a modern learning approach. We suggest exploring the difference between the teacher-centred strategy and the learner-centred strategy. Derrida revocates «logocentric» intonation the same as he declines any subordination, which is focused mode of a lector-expertize’s voice as the only source of sense, in favour of «grammatological» articulation. In fact the deconstruction gives voice to suppressed detonation. Maximum of such diffusion allows us to acknowledge students have equal rights to be sources of sense. In West-European teaching discourse it names learner-centred strategy. The conclusion is that the new Derrida’s strategy of reading is divided on three tactic steps, two of which he could perform himself and showed to us, while he could only detect third one by his intuition and invited us to step there ourselves. The first step is the intoning as guiding lines obtaining for the next steps. Philosophy (metaphysics) is opened through traditional «intono-logical» (logocentric) reading strategy. The second step is «suspension» of intonation’s dictat for the sake of dе-tonation of the intoned (any mistake has a positive value. The third step is articulation as perfect techniques of simultaneous reading of in- and de-tonations in their inversely corresponding completeness, which opens the whole field of tonation. The model of the lack of domination promotes the learning situation as a «just play» for all participants: a freed from command role instructor just as one of equal-righted participants of learning process becomes the same learner as students. So every time they together should look for knowledge in the other way then before."
10.31874/2309-1606-2017-20-1-280-295,Art within Philosophy of Education. P.1.,"Man, culture and art are a unique integrity. Philosophy generalizes the world-view bases of a definite historical form of culture and determines to a great extent the character of the process of cognition, including the artistic one (the harmonization of sensual and rational spheres of consciousness, the optimization of various types of information - verbal, sensory, structural ones, the development of productive thinking, etc.). Culture is equal to creative activity. So, creativity is a cultural activity with characteristic innovative approaches to solving social, professional and personal problems. The article defines art as a special form of culture and the concept of philosophy of education. Ideological and philosophical, multicultural, and trans-disciplinary approaches to the analysis of art and the dynamics of culture creation become methodologically important. Philosophy, science and art are complementary. The philosophical, scientific, artistic knowledge, the spiritual and practical development of the world reveal new cultural senses of the sign-symbol. Philosophy of education, focused on the value of a human being and creativity, involves the development of culture and art, contributing to personal creative development.  Unfortunately, modern youth have a very limited knowledge of classical, especially sacred art. It is personality orientation that reveals the dialogue of art, artistic traditions, the functioning of philosophy of education as an open system capable of multicultural communication."

As humanists, Lefèvre and his circle might be expected to avoid subjects such as the latitude of forms. Yet in certain dialogues Lefèvre offered an explicit rehabilitation of scholastic mathematical physics. This text assumed a metaphysics of making which allowed Lefèvre, Bovelles, and others to think of mathematical objects as relating to physical causes. They provide an account of knowing as making that responded to fifteenth-century concern about the balance of the active and the contemplative lives. These central moves in the making of a mathematical physics are the subject of this chapter."

This thought not only exists in his most important work named “Discorsi sopra la prima Deca di Tito Livio” but was also hidden in his masterpiece named “Il Principe”. This paper explores Niccolò Machiavelli’s republican thought in both of his above-mentioned works, particularly in “Discorsi sopra la prima Deca di Tito Livio”. Through specific evidences, the paper points out that republican government is Machiavelli’s most favourite political model, and the principality in his“Il Principe” is just his tactic solution or just his means to reach his ends which are to establish a republic in Italia."

Volume 6 includes work on a wide range of topics, including Tianyue Wu on Augustine’s theory of predestination, Fedor Benevich on the reality of non-existent objects within the Islamic tradition, Laurent Cesalli and Irène Rosier-Catach on Roger Bacon’s semantics, Therese Scarpelli Cory on Thomas Aquinas’s attitude toward empiricism, Jeffrey Hause on fraternal correction in later medieval ethics, Peter King on the relationship between Marguerite Porete and Godfrey of Fontaines, and Can Laurens Löwe on John Buridan’s views about the individuation of powers."
10.1093/oso/9780199588367.003.0010,Political Philosophy,"Although Herder is not usually known as a political philosopher, he in fact developed what is perhaps the most important political philosophy of his age. In domestic politics he was a liberal, a democrat, and an egalitarian; in international politics the champion of a distinctive pluralistic form of cosmopolitanism that sharply rejected imperialism, colonialism, slavery, and all other forms of exploitation of one people by another. Spanning both domains, while he enthusiastically shared the substantive goals of supporters of human rights he also developed a subtle critique of the concept itself, replacing it with his own concept of humanity. His political philosophy is theoretically minimalist and is all the stronger for being so."
10.1093/oso/9780199588367.003.0002,Philosophy of Language,"This chapter begins with a consideration of Herder’s best-known thesis in the philosophy of language—that the origins of language are natural rather than divine—but especially emphasizes three theses of much greater relevance today: (1) thought is essentially dependent on and bounded by language; (2) meaning consists in word-usage; and (3) all concepts are rooted in sensations. Theses (1) and (2) essentially founded modern philosophy of language. All three theses play foundational roles in Herder’s hermeneutics and theory of translation. The chapter argues that Herder’s positive arguments for these theses are powerful, and that he also develops sophisticated answers to objections to them based on seeming counterexamples, such as the occurrence of thought and meaning in non-linguistic animals and in non-linguistic art. The chapter concludes with a briefer consideration of additional principles that Herder develops in the philosophy of language, such as that language is fundamentally social in character."
10.1093/oso/9780199588367.003.0006,Philosophy of Mind,"Herder developed a very powerful and influential philosophy of mind. He was the source of Hegel’s famous threefold distinction between subjective, objective, and absolute mind (or Geist). Concerning the fundamental mind–body question he wavered between neutral monism and materialism, but developed a theory that has marked advantages over rival theories such as dualism, mind–brain identity, and behaviorism. Accordingly, he also developed a naturalized reconception of immortality. He also worked out an important theory of the unity of the mind’s faculties. In addition, he argued both that minds are fundamentally social and that they nonetheless include individuality. And finally, he developed a rich and original theory of the unconscious. These positions are not only of great intrinsic value, but also exercised a powerful influence on successors such as Hegel, Schleiermacher, and Nietzsche."
10.1093/oso/9780199588367.003.0009,Philosophy of History,"Herder makes a number of vitally important contributions to the philosophy of history. His well-known teleological conception of history as a realization of humanity and reason was influential but is probably untenable. A more intrinsically important contribution is a deep commitment to historicization, or the radical transformation of phenomena over time, including historicism, or the deep mutability of human mental life over the course of history. Others are a closely related commitment to reorienting historiography away from explanation towards understanding; a “genetic” or “genealogical” method for explaining psychological phenomena in light of their emergence out of earlier origins and transformations thereof; a conception of historical Bildung; and a recognition that historicism leads to, or exacerbates, skeptical problems, together with a promising strategy for coping with such problems in the domain of value. Herder’s influence in this whole area on thinkers such as Hegel, Nietzsche, and Dilthey was enormous."
10.1093/oso/9780199588367.003.0008,Moral Philosophy,"Herder develops a number of very important principles both in meta-ethics and in first-order morality. In meta-ethics he argues for a form of sentimentalism, but a form of it that acknowledges a role for cognition in the sentiments involved and which emphasizes their radical variability between periods and cultures. He also invents a “genetic” or “genealogical” method predicated on such variability and applies it to moral values in particular in order to make them better understood. And finally, he develops an ambitious theory and practice of moral pedagogy that rests on his sentimentalism and which accordingly focuses on causal influences on moral character formation, such as role models and literature. In first-order morality he invents an important pluralistic form of cosmopolitanism to replace the more usual but problematic homogenizing cosmopolitanism of the Enlightenment; an influential ideal of individual Bildung, or self-formation; and a distinctive ideal of humanity."
10.1093/oso/9780199588367.001.0001,Herder's Philosophy,"This book considers Herder’s philosophy in the round and argues that it is both far more impressive in quality and far more influential in modern thought than has previously been realized. After an introduction on Herder’s intellectual biography, philosophical style, and general program in philosophy, there are chapters on his philosophy of language, his hermeneutics, his theory of translation, his contribution of the philosophical foundations for both linguistics and cultural anthropology, his philosophy of mind, his aesthetics, his moral philosophy, his philosophy of history, his political philosophy, his philosophy of religion, and his intellectual influence. The book argues that he contributed vitally important ideas in all of these areas; that in many of them his ideas were seminal for subsequent philosophers, including Friedrich Schlegel, Schleiermacher, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Hegel, and Nietzsche; that they indeed founded whole new disciplines, such as linguistics, anthropology, and comparative literature; and that moreover they were in many cases even better than what these subsequent thinkers and disciplines went on to make of them."
10.1093/oso/9780199588367.003.0011,Philosophy of Religion,"Like most German philosophers of his day Herder was no radical critic of religion and Christianity in the later manner of Marx or Nietzsche, but some of his contributions in this area did advance their sort of project. He was a liberal Christian, in terms of both tolerance and doctrine—examples of the latter sort of liberalism being his naturalized conception of immortality and his neo-Spinozism. In fact, he was the central figure in the emergence of neo-Spinozism, which he developed by the mid-1770s and which went on to constitute the foundations of both German Romanticism and post-Kantian German Idealism. He developed important new secular principles of biblical interpretation and thereby made important interpretive discoveries concerning the Bible. He conceived the novel project of a comparative study of religions and mythologies. And despite being a devout Christian, he also developed stinging criticisms of the history of organized Christianity."
10.1017/s0031819118000232,Is There Progress in Philosophy? The Case for Taking History Seriously,"AbstractIn response to widespread doubts among professional philosophers (Russell, Horwich, Dietrich, McGinn, Chalmers), Stoljar argues for a ‘reasonable optimism’ about progress in philosophy. He defends the large and surprising claim that ‘there is progress on all or reasonably many of the big questions’. However, Stoljar's caveats and admitted avoidance of historical evidence permits overlooking persistent controversies in philosophy of mind and cognitive science that are essentially unchanged since the 17th Century. Stoljar suggests that his claims are commonplace in philosophy departments and, indeed, the evidence I adduce constitutes an indictment of the widely shared view among professional analytic philosophers."

10.3390/philosophies3040027,Natural Philosophy and Natural Logic,"1. Nature has its own logic, which does not follow the human will. Nature is itself; it exists, moves, changes, and evolves according to its own intrinsic ways. Human and human society, as a product of a specific stage of natural development, can only be a concrete manifestation of the logic of nature. 2. In the broad sense, nature refers to all, both phenomena and processes, in the universe. It includes human society spiritual phenomena. In a narrow sense, nature refers to the world outside the society and opposed to society as well, or refers to the research objects of natural sciences 3. The narrow natural philosophy is in the intermediary position between the natural sciences and the overall philosophy (the supreme philosophy, an advocation of Kun Wu’s philosophy of information. For further detail, please refer to the subscript in the following.). Furthermore, it is an independent sub-level philosophical discipline; the broad natural philosophy is a meta-philosophy or supreme philosophy, stipulating the entire world from the dimensions of nature itself. 4. Natural philosophy reveals the laws of nature’s own existence, movement, change, and evolution. This determines that the way of expressing natural philosophy is necessarily natural ontology. The construction of the theoretical system of natural philosophy is inevitably a process of abandoning cognitive mediums of human beings through reflection. It is necessary for us to conclude that natural philosophy is the stipulation of nature itself, which comes out of the nature itself. So, we must explain the nature from the standpoint of the nature itself. 5. The true philosophy should move from the human world to the nature, finding back Husserl’s suspended things, and establish a brand-new philosophy in which man and nature, substance, information, and spirit are united. This kind of philosophy is able to provide contemporary ecological civilization with a reasonable philosophical foundation, rebuilding natural philosophy in a new era, which is a very urgent task for contemporary philosophers. 6. The unity of philosophy and science cannot be seen merely as an external convergence, but also as an intrinsic fusion; a true philosophy should have a scientific character, and science itself must have a philosophical basis. The unity of such an intrinsic fusion of science and philosophy can be fully demonstrated by the practical relationship of development between human philosophy and science. 7. In addition to the narrow path along epistemology, linguistics, and phenomenology, the development of human philosophy has another path. This is the development of philosophy itself that has been nurtured and demonstrated during the development of general science: On the one hand, the construction of scientific rationality requires philosophical thinking and exploration; On the other hand, the progress of science opens the way for the development of philosophy. 8. In the real process of the development of human knowledge, science and philosophy are regulated, contained, and merged with each other in the process of interaction. The two are inlaid together internally to form an interactive dynamic feedback loop. The unified relationship of mutual influence, regulation, promotion and transformation presented in the intrinsic interplay of interaction between science and philosophy profoundly breeds and demonstrates the general way of human knowledge development: the philosophicalization (a term used in Kun Wu’s philosophy of information. For more details please see in Kun Wu, 2016, The Interaction and Convergence of the Philosophy and Science of Information, https://doi.org/10.3390/philosophies1030228) of science and scientification (a term used in Kun Wu’s philosophy of information. For more detail, please see in Kun Wu, 2016, The Interaction and Convergence of the Philosophy and Science of Information, https://doi.org/10.3390/philosophies1030228) of philosophy. 9. We face two types of dogmatism: one is the dogmatism of naturalism, and the other is the dogmatism of the philosophy of consciousness. One of the best ways to overcome these tendencies of dogmatism is to unite natural ontology, and epistemic constructivism. The crisis of contemporary philosophy induced by the western consciousness philosophy seems like belonging to the field of epistemology, but the root of this crisis is deeply buried in the ontology. The key to solving the crisis of contemporary philosophy lies precisely in the reconstruction of the doctrine of natural philosophy centering to the nature itself and excluding God. The task to be accomplished by this new natural philosophy is how to regain the natural foundation of human consciousness after the God has left the field. 10. Since the 1980s, the philosophy of information established and developed in China has proposed a theory of objective information, as well as the dual existence and dual evolution of matter and information (a key advocation in the ontological theory of Kun Wu’s philosophy of information). It is this theory that has made up for the vacancy existing between matter and mind, which apparently exists in Cartesian dualism, after the withdrawal of the God’s from the field. Philosophy of information in China is first and foremost a natural philosophy that adheres to naturalistic attitudes. Second, this natural philosophy explains the human, human mind and human society in the interpretation of the process and mechanism of natural evolution. In this connection, philosophy of information (a key advocation of Kun Wu’s philosophy of information) in China is a system of meta-philosophy or supreme philosophy. This system undoubtedly has the nature of a new natural philosophy. At the same time, this philosophy can better reflect the philosophical spirit of the information age."
10.25180/lj.v20i1.119,Non-Philosophy and the uninterpretable axiom,"This article connects François Laruelle's non-philosophical experiments with the axiomatic method to non-philosophy's anti-hermeneutic stance. Focusing on two texts from 1987 composed using the axiomatic method, ""The Truth According to Hermes"" and ""Theorems on the Good News,"" I demonstrate how non-philosophy utilizes structural mechanisms to both expand and contract the field of potential models allowed by non-philosophy. This demonstration involves developing a notion of interpretation, which synthesizes Rocco Gangle's work on model theory with respect to non-philosophy with Laruelle's critique of hermeneutics. I use Alexander Galloway's interpretation of ""The Truth According to Hermes"" as a case study of the limits non-philosophy sets upon its use as a basis for philosophical models, in contrast to arguments by Gangle regarding non-philosophy's greater genericity in comparison to philosophy. "
10.25180/lj.v20i1.115,The Origins of Laruelle's Non-Philosophy in Ravaisson's Understanding of Metaphysics,"Laruelle's first book Phenomenon and Difference: An Essay on Ravaisson's Ontology (1971) is unanimously overlooked as having little relevance to his later non-philosophy. On the contrary, this paper analyses Laruelle's dissertation and Ravaisson's writings to show how Ravaisson enables Laruelle to develop non-philosophy's three central ideas of decision, radical immanence, and cloning. Firstly, Laruelle inherits Ravaisson's critique of Platonism and anti-Platonism as dividing the unity of being between two terms, of which one alone is conflated with being to the detriment of the other as non-being. Moreover, Laruelle follows Ravaisson's third way of envisioning being as a radical immanence, which philosophy presupposes to constitute its dualisms by dividing being into opposed terms. Finally, Laruelle's cloning adheres to Ravaisson's eclectic method of expressing being's true immanence through his cohering of all philosophies, as well as disciplines like art and religion, into a single narrative of one and the same being's self-unfolding. "

10.31234/osf.io/48qux,"Making research evaluation more transparent:  Aligning research philosophy, institutional values, and reporting","There is a growing interest in changing the culture of psychology to improve the quality of our science.  At the root of this interest is concern over the reproducibility of key findings. A variety of large-scale replication attempts have revealed that a number of previously published effects cannot be reproduced, while other analyses indicate that the published literature is rife with underpowered studies and publication bias. These revelations suggest that it is time to change how psychological science is carried out and increase transparency of reporting. We argue change will be slow until institutions adopt new procedures for evaluating scholarly activity. We consider three actions that individuals and departments can take to facilitate change throughout psychological science. These three actions are the development of individualized research philosophy statements, the creation of an annotated curriculum vitae to improve the transparency of scholarly reporting, and the use of a formal evaluative system that explicitly captures behaviors that support reproducibility. Our recommendations build on proposals for open science by enabling researchers to have a voice in articulating (and contextualizing) how they would like their work to be evaluated and by providing a mechanism for more detailed and transparent reporting of scholarly activities."

10.31874/2309-1606-2016-19-2-59-74,"“New Humanism”: Integrative System of Philosophy of Education, Ethics, Social Management and Pedagogy","Explore the major ideological patterns of development of a socially philosophies of education in the context of the problems of institutionalization of knowledge about human and social development. To analyse system-integration aspect of social philosophy and education management in interaction with model of «new humanism» in formation of socially valuable orientations. Classification existing in the western philosophy of education and education of directions is spent, proceeding from basic principles of philosophical school or a current, first of all considering those the purpose and means which are really involved by them in process of education, social development and socially-moral education and being based on the basic installations, the purpose expressed by that or other direction, how its supporters imagine the person, its requirement, a social role, behaviour which the education system and education urged to form.&#x0D;
Considering growing requirement of a practical embodiment of ideas of freedom, justice, aspiration to realisation of the human rights proclaimed a society, supporters of the concept of «new humanism» see the main objective in blocking a way to conformism, to a manipulation behaviour of the person and to create conditions for its free self-expression, for realisation by the person of a fundamental choice of acts in a concrete situation and by that to warn danger of formation of the unified form of behaviour. In it principles of «new humanism» approach with a position of  instrumentalism and neopragmatism.&#x0D;
Before social philosophy of education/upbringing  it is necessary to define a problem factors which cause achievement of its main objective, to state an estimation to moral principles and personal qualities with which actually the education/education theory connects realisation of the problems, to show, why these, instead of any any other principles and qualities open to the person possibility to choose in a concrete situation socially powerful both morally defensible and comprehensible line of conduct in public the relation. Statement of a question on necessity of the philosophical analysis of problems of education and education in a social context serves as an indicator of understanding philosophers, teachers of an increasing role of the human and moral factor in society development. And, at last, the aspiration to develop socially-philosophical bases of pedagogics in general and education in particular, testifies that the western and domestic philosophers, teachers, representatives of social and psychological sciences, at least, the majority of them, have realised the public importance of an education system and education, its global character."
10.31874/2309-1606-2018-22-1-115-133,Existential-dialogical model of philosophy of education: educational-upbringing and social-spiritual communication in the context of social development,"An existential-dialogical philosophy of education, mainly represented by O. Bollnow (modern «optimistic», «positive existentialism»), underlines the meaning and background of the pedagogical relationship in interpersonal relationships, the relationship between I and You. In its initial philosophical positions, it is based on the «philosophy of life» and mainly on existentialism both in the «classical» and «optimistic» versions. Supporters of this direction tend to discard the technocratic concepts which substitute for the process of education with the manipulation of person. Based on the thesis of uniqueness, the uniqueness of the individual, which is revealed in extreme situations, the supporters of this approach do not recognize the dominant role of the social environment in the formation of man. The environment, in their view, can only cause enormous damage to its moral self-development, since social institutions are aimed at the unification of personality and its behavior. Moral education, on the contrary, is intended to reveal the individual qualities and abilities of the individual, which will help to preserve the moral essence of the individual in the processes of knowledge acquisition, development of intelligence and in the education system. In the formation of a unique personality, the followers of irrationalism see an obstacle to totalitarian manifestations and dangers. In their opinion, the formation of a uniqueness, unique personality is nothing more than a process of self-development and self-education, which involves overcoming in human behavior «mass» trends, because the real education and education could not have their object exclusively in mass area. They see the tasks of education and upbringing as taking a unique personality away from the mass, «collectivist society» as a source of «false existence». But the closure of the process of education/upbringing on a separate subject, its isolation from social ties and relations dramatically limits the real possibility of forming an active personality, although the adherents of this approach proclaim this one of the main goals of education. In addition, the self-isolation of the individual increases its alienation in the world, making it increasingly vulnerable to the anti-human tendencies of global society."

Any problem-based education is searching and cognition of unknown. It is based on mental, volitional, and emotional activity, but, above all, it requires to be interested in the subject of study. The author stresses that problem-based education can be practiced in small student groups, which have the sufficient level of interest and motivation to study philosophy. Also, the author introduces his own classification of problem solving tasks in teaching of philosophy, which will help to apply educational material in accordance with the level of students, for example: 1) problematic situations that contribute to the formulation of new concepts (they help to generalize all previous knowledge and extract  from it a new one); 2) historical and philosophical problematic situations - these are situations based on historical and philosophical material, when students compare the solution of some philosophical problem in the philosophy of a certain epoch, compare the approaches of different philosophers; 3) developmental problematic situations which help students to understand the logic of defining some philosophical concept, to understand one or another philosopher and his methods of creating concepts."
10.31874/2309-1606-2018-22-1-25-87,"Philosophy of Education of the Third Reich: origin, political and ideological contexts and conceptual constructions","The article proposes the analysis of the development of the philosophy of education in the Third Reich, including its theoretical origin with corresponding social, cultural and political contexts. The leading role of the political romantics is showed in this process with its educational implications. This research has a wide-spread empirical background including narrative interviews with the former participants of the educational processes which are described both on the factual and interpretative level. The semantics and linguistic preferences of national-socialism used in its philosophy of education show the pedagogical intentions grounded on the race theory. The “folk view of world” in the period of the national-social movement was later changed into the philosophy of political education and folk-political anthropology (E. Krieck), where the concept folk community with its leader (Führer) is a constitutive one and the functional education has become a priority before the intentional  strategies. The deformation of bourgeois human ideal through returning to the myth of origin and Nietzsche’s concept of the superman is remarkable in the new contrary ideals of “the Soldier” (A. Baeumler) and the “Worker”(E. Jünger) used in the educational practices of the national-socialism with the priority of the functional education.  The identification of the “soldier way of life” as the representation of Nordic race with the pedagogical reality had consequences in the curriculum philosophy of schools and universities, where the physical education and the race theory have displaced the traditional subjects studies and their research fields, especially after their synchronic switching on the totalitarian state, which must understand itself as the educational one created for the German race. The national-socialist political pedagogic has the features of the “total mobilization” for the total war as the free decision of young men ready to die for Hitler’s Germany. Emphasizing of the self-activities, self-control, self-aid and self-education in the national-pedagogical directives is connected with the utopian dream of automatically fulfillment of all educational plans with the intention to create a new human for the new society. The new schools organized  under national-socialism have showed the regress in comparison with educational institutions of the Weimar republic, where the educational system has showed more variety and flexibility as the chaotic improvisations of  the educational reformers of the Third Reich with their fiction of the educational philosophy, which was only the well-known  maid of the new political theology."
10.3390/philosophies3040028,We Need to Recreate Natural Philosophy,"Modern science began as natural philosophy, an admixture of philosophy and science. It was then killed off by Newton, as a result of his claim to have derived his law of gravitation from the phenomena by induction. But this post-Newtonian conception of science, which holds that theories are accepted on the basis of evidence, is untenable, as the long-standing insolubility of the problem of induction indicates. Persistent acceptance of unified theories only in physics, when endless equally empirically successful disunified rivals are available, means that physics makes a persistent, problematic metaphysical assumption about the universe: that all disunified theories are false. This assumption, precisely because it is problematic, needs to be explicitly articulated within physics, so that it can be critically assessed and, we may hope, improved. The outcome is a new conception of science—aim-oriented empiricism—that puts science and philosophy together again, and amounts to a modern version of natural philosophy. Furthermore, aim-oriented empiricism leads to the solution to the problem of induction. Natural philosophy pursued within the methodological framework of aim-oriented empiricism is shown to meet standards of intellectual rigour that science without metaphysics cannot meet."

Articles discuss the contextual method, classically articulated by Quentin Skinner, along with important alternative methods associated with Leo Strauss and his followers, and contemporary post-modernism. This first part also examines the value of the history of political philosophy and the history of the discipline itself. Part II, based upon chronological periods, works through the entire history of Western political philosophy. While most articles address recognizable chronological periods, others are devoted to more specialized topics, including the influence of Roman law, medieval Arabic political philosophy, socialism, and Marxism. Aspects of the history of political philosophy that transcend specific periods are the subject of Part III. Articles on topics such as democracy, the state, and imperialism trace theoretical developments over time. The histories of major non-Western traditions—Muslim, Confucian, and Hindu—are discussed in the final part, with special reference to their relationships to Western political thought."

Rethinking humanism and rationality: contributions from Karl-Otto Apel’s philosophy.,"Resumen:El siguiente trabajo intenta realizar un aporte a la recuperación y refor- mulación del concepto de humanismo en nuestro contexto histórico y filosófico actual desde el punto de vista de la filosofía de Karl-Otto Apel. En primer lugar, se analiza la categoría apeliana de “crítica total de la razón” con la que se sintetiza el núcleo de convergencia de las principales corrientes actuales de pensamiento, como por ejemplo el posmodernismo, el postestructuralismo y el neopragmatismo. Precisamente, tal núcleo consistiría para Apel en un radical cuestionamiento de la racionalidad en cuanto tal. En una reconstrucción de estas posiciones se pueden reconocer dos antecedentes fundamentales y fundantes: Nietzsche y Heidegger. En segundo lugar, se explican los elementos centrales de una renovación (o ampliación) del concepto de racionalidad, entendida en términos consensual-comunicativos. Aquí encontramos un punto de contacto entre las corrientes señaladas y la filosofía discursiva de Apel: la crítica al concepto moderno de sujeto y su propuesta de superación.Palabras clave: Karl-Otto Apel – racionalidad - humanismoAbstract:This work tries to make a contribution to the reformulation of the concept of humanism in our historical and philosophical context, from Karl-Otto Apel’s philosophy point of view. In first place, it analyses the category of “total critique of reason”, which summarizes the core of the principal contemporary tendencies of thought, such as, postmodernism, poststruc- turalism or neopramatism. This core would consist, according to Apel, in a radical questioning of rationality at all. In a reconstruction of these insights two fundamental antecedents can be recognized: Nietzsche and Heidegger.

10.22311/2074-1529-2018-14-3-115-130,NTERPRETATION OF RUBA‘IAT: ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PHILOSOPHY OF ‘ABD AL-RAHMAN AL-JAMI,"‘Abd al-Rahman Jami is known mostly as a poet. Nevertheless, his contribution to Islamic philosophy is also considerable. He was a follower of Ibn Arabi — the founder of the philosophical tasawwuf, whose works were very inﬂ uential in the classic Iranian thought. The philosophy of Jami was outlined in a number of his works, among them are the commentary to the “Fusus al-Hikam” by Ibn Arabi and a short treaty “The commentary to the ruba‘yat” that contains 49 ruba‘i by Jami with his own commentary. This is one of his most important works, explaining the matter of wahdat al-wujud. This article gives an excursus to this treaty, making an accent at the Jami’s interpretation of the necessary being at the context of his epoch of thought. We try to show, that his philosophy, on one hand, deals very much with the works by Ibn Arabi and Suhrawardy, inherits their concepts and problems, so it cannot be properly understood apart from their works. On the other hand, Jami has his own point of view to the philosophy concepts of his teachers. For instance, he gives us a typology of beings, that includes three stages. The ﬁ rst, the lowest one is the stage of a beings whose being is diff erent to their selfness (dhat). They are the things, that surround us every day and passively accept being from an external source. The second one is the being whose selfness is diff erent to its being, but its reality (haqiqa) cannot be seen apart from it. It’s an active matter (the mentioned “source”), that gives being to the beings of the ﬁ rst stage. And the third stage is the simple being, the same to the God’s selfness, that unites the ﬁ rst and the second stages."

The author, referring to selected views on the essence of the criminal law, indicates that the philosophy of law is a binder of the entire criminal law system, serving the implementation of its goals and functions, and guaranteeing that criminal law serves the service of the human person. The philosophy of criminal law applies in many respects, especially in justifying the basic principles of criminal law and in connection with the axiology of protection of human rights and the Constitution.

From research methods, questionnaire survey and observation were used. These methods were further supplemented with a semi-structured interview with the employees of banking institutions. The obtained data were analyzed by statistical methods. In association with the conducted researches it can be generally stated that the addressed respondents agree with the statement that their banking institution does implement age diversity of employees in a certain form and Age Management principles – the idea of heterogeneous structure of employees, development of working conditions and environment for performance of required working conditions or cooperation on corporate projects."
10.11118/actaun201260050277,Plant physiology at the institute for philosophy in Brno in Mendel’s teacher F. Diebl textbook from 1835,"Gregor Mendel attended lectures of F. Diebl, professor of natural history and agricultural science at the Institute of Philosophy in Brno. Diebl published his lectures in a textbook “Abhandlungen über die allgemeine und besondere Naturgeschichte, Brünn 1835.” From the textbook the level of scientific knowledge in plant biology is obvious, with which the later founder of a new field of biology – genetics got acquainted. Diebl considered germination to be a specific method of fermentation transforming seed starch into a sugary matter which nourishes the germinating plant. In the physiology of nutrition he distinguished nutrition from the soil via roots from nutrition from the air via leaves. The former is based primarily on the humus theory of A. Thaer (1809) because not until 5 years after the publication of Diebl’s textbook J. Liebig initiated the mineral theory. Diebl’s presentation of photosynthesis was based on information available at that time about the release of oxygen by green plants under conditions of light and the uptake of CO2, but he had no knowledge about the passage of CO2 into the leaves through stomata. Remarkable is Diebl’s discovery that respiration increases during flowering. Electricity is considered to be a force significantly supporting the life processes of plants. Diebl also noticed the difference between diurnal and night evaporation of water from the leaves. In his textbook growth is connected with nutrition only, as it was the entire 19th century. Stem thickening from the cambium is described very simply. Bud and root regeneration is given the term reproduction which today is commonly used in relation to sexual reproduction. Diebl considered nyctinastic movements (bending or unbending of the leaves) and closing of the flowers at night to be “sleep”. He described fertilisation in a primitive way, because it was not until 1848 that the first exact description came out."
10.11118/actaun201159040019,Economic and regional consequences of direct payments under the current CAP philosophy,"The paper deals with one of the key instruments of the actual EU Common Agricultural Policy (the CAP), the direct payments. The economic as well as the regional implications of application for direct payments in the CAP strategy are evaluated there. The study deals with the economic costs, direct and indirect effects of such type of subsidy in general and a demonstration thereof in the context of the development of the European model of agriculture. Based on the economic principle of this type of transfer evalution, the processes of the income redistribution in the framework of global/common policy in general is characterized. It explains the causes as well as the nature of implementation of this instrument in the reform processes in the last twenty years, focusing on the reasons and consequences of different application in the original and the new EU member states. It considers the question of whether this type of support to agriculture is truly a tool that does not interfere with market conditions affect the respective competitive ability of agricultural producers. In the context of changes to income support in agriculture in the CAP development process, the effect of decoupled payments on the pricing within the agricultural commodity markets is specified. At the same time the work deals with a broader social context and social impact of the differing forms of support in European regions. "
10.11118/actaun201159020021,Comparing the potential use of oriental war philosophy and western combat strategies in the competition of companies,"Sun Tzu’s essays The Art of War are the oldest known treatise on this topic but they have never been surpassed in terms of content and depth of understanding. They are characterised by concentrated wisdom on warfare. Compared to Carl von Clausewitz, Sun Tzu has a clearer vision, deeper understanding of preparation and combat itself and this makes him modern for eternity. Clausewitz wrote more than two thousand years later but he is more indebted to this period than Sun Tzu and this makes him rather obsolete nowadays even though some of his ideas are applicable, even though they can be applied only within the limitations of the moral and ethic values applied in a particular ­territory. If using the approach stemming from Sun Tzu’s oriental war philosophy it is necessary to understand these ideas and to implement them correctly. In this respect we find it very important to point out to the incorrect trend that can be identified in the studies of western literature dealing with this war philosophy. "
10.5130/ajceb.v11i2.2201,"Investigating informality in construction: philosophy, paradigm and practice","The complex interrelationships commonly enacted as a consequence of project team activity take a number of different forms, including those formally dictated by contract conditions. However it is becoming increasingly apparent that project performance is affected by informal relationships, though their investigation is notoriously difficult. This paper proposes that these difficulties arise partly from the nature of the informalities themselves, but also as a consequence of the philosophical position taken by researchers and their consequent methodological/paradigmatic posture, and its impact upon those being studied. It consequently proposes a subjectivist investigative framework that accommodates multiple philosophical points of departure, matching them to a range of alternative methodologies, and indicates the desirability of blending to reflect the peculiarities of each context under investigation. The framework also accommodates the practicalities of putting complex methodologies into action. The paper concludes that this framework presents opportunities to conduct rigorous in-situ investigations of informality at work, leading to authentic and deep insights that would otherwise remain unseen"

Philosophy is understood as a practice, an experience, a creation of concepts, an inquiry, as an exercise of argumentation and research. Thanks to this view, a dialogue has opened up with the pupis of this school. In this contribution we present the perspective of a post-philosophy for children and we understand it as an opportunity for philosophy in itself."

10.17323/1728-192x-2018-3-149-172,The Parallaxes of the Fox: Towards Definition of the Subject and Status of Social Philosophy,"The author of this article tries to reconsider the subject field of social-philosophical knowledge. He considers the principal difference of social philosophy from theoretical sociology, historical sociology, and political philosophy. On the basis of this differentiation, it is stated that social philosophy is a separate and coherent discipline. The author then considers several possible approaches to the study of society that could be characterized as “weak programs” of social philosophy. On such a basis, it is claimed that a “strong program” of social philosophy could be formed. This program must organically combine the following assumptions: the methodology of neo-Marxism, including the orientation towards the traditional for these current intellectual objects of analysis, and accurate and thorough studies, as well as a firmness and conceptual coherence, i.e., a level of analysis beyond the immediate empirical material. The author then considers one of the main challenges that social philosophy faces or must face in the nearest future. Social philosophy has to fulfill an important task: to say something sensible about the times we are living in, to determine changes in culture and economy, as well as to give an answer to the question of what comes instead of postmodernity, if such a thing ever existed. On the basis of the above-mentioned points, the following working definition of social philosophy is given: multiple (although not always) philosophical conceptualizations of social problems, phenomena, and complex notions, as well as theoretical attempts at interpreting our or/and another epoch, which, in the interpretation, first of all assumes a normative dimension, and secondly, is based on rich empirical material. This approach can also be explained through the notion of “the parallax of the fox”, which assumes that social philosophy deals with many things, but at the same time, tries to give a new look at existing problems and to determine its heuristic potential."

Paul Carter, Ross Gibson and Stephen Muecke have all offered transgressive and dynamic practices, engaging with speculative and experimental ways of thinking. But how can such speculation be supported and contextualised in critical debate? Muecke in particular draws from a background of Continental philosophy in constructing his critical practice. He is influenced by the work of Bruno Latour and Etienne Souriau. The latter is a largely forgotten French philosopher, untranslated in English. He offers a theory of existential pluralism, suggesting the multiplicity of modes of existence and exploring the nature of relation between them. Developing an understanding of his philosophy can help contextualise Muecke’s work, and potentially contribute to this critical movement more generally."

10.14746/eip.2016.1.11,Common Sense and Scientific Inquiry: Remarks on John Dewey’s Philosophy of Educational Progressivism,"This paper focuses on analysis of relation between pedagogical and epistemological ideas of John Dewey. Our considerations are divided into four sections. (1) We reconstruct Dewey’s conception of culture as a body of normative and regulative common sense beliefs determining human conduct and language use. (2) Further, we compare common sense based inquiry and its scientific mode with regard to their respective conceptual frameworks in order to show that “theoretical-scientific” perspective provides more comprehensive insight into the relations constituting problem situations. (3) We identify informal education with socialization processes and argue that educational process relies on constant reflection on cultural habits. (4) We conclude that competences of using theoretical conceptual frameworks and conducting scientific inquiry play crucial role in Dewey’s educational ideology of progressivism since they provide basic tools for critical reconsideration and revision of common sense beliefs."

Four philosophical schools of the Hellenistic times remain influential for the following centuries: Plato and Neoplatonism, Aristotle and the Peripatetics, the Stoics and the Epicureans. We are interpreting two, only two, poems from Thomas More and Jacob Balde, and so we see the greatest possible influence of all these four ancient philosophical schools."

10.4324/9780415249126-p063-2,Experimental philosophy,"Experimental philosophy is not a philosophy; it is a method that is supposed to contribute to philosophical inquiry. Characteristically, experimental philosophers use empirical techniques to investigate philosophically significant intuitions about hypothetical and actual cases. An intuition, in this context, is normally understood as a spontaneous judgment about the case. Like noninferential perceptual judgments, they simply occur rather than being a product of conscious reasoning to the conclusion.
         Intuitions play a key role in much philosophical theorizing. The attempt to provide a conceptual analysis or definition for important philosophical concepts, e.g. knowledge, meaning, responsibility, has long been a major theoretical concern in philosophy. One prominent philosophical view holds that the meaning of our concepts is given by the folk theory (or set of common-sense beliefs) in which the concepts are embedded. Intuitions about cases are thought to reveal the contours of the folk theory and the meaning of the concept. As a result, in pursuing conceptual analyses, many philosophers rely on intuitions about cases to descry the folk theories in which those concepts are embedded.
         In addition to their role in conceptual analysis, philosophers invoke intuitions as evidence for substantive philosophical claims, perhaps in much the same way as empirical scientists invoke observation as evidence. For instance, the intuition that it is wrong to push one man in front of a speeding trolley to save five others is invoked as evidence that utilitarianism does not give the right theory of how we ought to act. Similarly, intuitions are used to support substantive claims about knowledge, meaning and responsibility.
         When philosophers use intuitions - whether in the service of conceptual analysis or in the effort to establish a more substantive philosophical claim - the traditional methodology looks a priori. That is, one arrives at one’s judgments without relying on evidence from sensory perception. For instance, to analyze the concept intentional a philosopher might consult their intuitions about whether the concept applies in various actual and possible circumstances, and a condition of adequacy upon the definition is that it best conforms to these intuitions. In contrast, experimental philosophers use experimental techniques to study intuitions about philosophically important concepts."
10.4324/9780415249126-s019-2,Green political philosophy,"All the major political philosophies have been born of crisis. Green political philosophy is no exception to this general rule. It has emerged from that interconnected series of crises that is often termed ‘the environmental crisis’. As we enter the second decade of the twenty-first century it seems quite clear that the level and degree of environmental degradation and destruction cannot be sustained over the longer term without dire consequences for human and other animal species, and the ecosystems on which all depend. A veritable explosion in the human population, the pollution of air and water, the melting of the polar ice caps and the resulting rise in sea levels, the overfishing of the oceans, the destruction of tropical and temperate rain forests, the extinction of entire species, the depletion of the ozone layer, the build-up of greenhouse gases, global warming, desertification, wind and water erosion of precious topsoil, the disappearance of valuable farmland and wilderness for ‘development’ – these and many other interrelated phenomena provide the backdrop and justification for the ‘greening’ of much of modern political thinking.
         The task of outlining and summarizing the state of green political philosophy is made more difficult because there is as yet no agreement among ‘green’ political thinkers. Indeed there is, at present, no definitive ‘green political philosophy’ as such. The environmental or green movement is diverse and disparate, and appears in different shades of green. These range from ‘light green’ conservationists to ‘dark green’ deep ecologists, from ecofeminists to social ecologists, from the militant ecoteurs of Earth First!, to the low-keyed gradualists of the Sierra Club and the Nature Conservancy. These groups differ not only over strategy and tactics, but also over fundamental philosophy as well.
         While there is no single, systematically articulated and agreed-upon green political philosophy, however, there are nonetheless recurring topics, themes, categories and concepts that are surely central to such a political philosophy. These include the idea that humans are part of nature and members of a larger and more inclusive ‘biotic community’ to which they have obligations or duties. This community includes both human and nonhuman animals, and the conditions conducive to their survival and flourishing. Such a community consists, moreover, not only of members who are alive but those who are as yet unborn. A green political philosophy values both biological and cultural diversity, and views sustainability as a standard by which to judge the justness of human actions and practices. Exactly how these themes might fit together to form some larger, systematic and coherent whole is still being worked out."
10.4324/9780415249126-v040-1,"Linguistics, philosophy of","Although related to issues in the philosophy of language, the philosophy of linguistics is a largely distinct topic, being concerned not so much with language itself but with the character and significance of scientific theories about it, for example, with the ontology of linguistic entities, and with whether linguistics is properly regarded as a branch of psychology or as of a kind of mathematics. The work of Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jacobson initiated interest in many of these topics, leading to the structuralist movement in Continental Europe, but it was the work of Noam Chomsky that later sparked the cognitive revolution in Anglo-American philosophy and psychology. Chomsky argued that linguistics should not be concerned with the actual performance of speakers, but instead with the underlying system of rules that was responsible for the competence to produce and understand those utterances. Calling attention to a stunning array of data, he went on to argue that linguistic theory should be concerned with the innately specified system that enabled young children to acquire that competence so effortlessly in a remarkably short time. This claim he linked to the tradition of philosophical Rationalism, according to which substantial portions of human knowledge are not obtained from experience, as Empiricists had maintained, but are largely innate. These and related claims have occasioned important exchanges with a number of philosophers about the foundations of language and mind."
10.4324/9780415249126-v043-1,Mind and body in early modern philosophy,"European philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries proposed a wide range of views about the nature of the mind and its relation to the body.
         René Descartes (1596–1650) argued that there are two distinct parts to human beings, mind and body, which are substances of radically different kinds, and either of which could exist without the other – although, in fact, in living humans, they are always connected together. He argued for this dualism in several works, including his Meditations on First Philosophy (Descartes [1641] 1984). Elsewhere, in his Discourse on the Method (Descartes [1637] 1985), he argued – based on empirical observation of the difference between humans and other animals – that reason is unique to humans. Indeed, Descartes thought that, because non-human animals do not have an incorporeal mind, they do not even really have sensations.
         Though Descartes’s views have been very influential, they attracted critics from the outset. For example, Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) argued against Descartes that the thinking mind is corporeal, Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655) objected to Descartes’s method of investigating the mind, and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia (1618–80) objected to his explanation – or lack of explanation – of how the incorporeal mind and the corporeal body are related to one another.
         Questions about that relationship continued to divide philosophers in the generation after Descartes. In different ways, occasionalists such as Nicolas Malebranche (1638–1715) and the anti-occasionalist Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) both denied that distinct created substances (such as the Cartesian mind and body) could really have a causal influence on each other. Benedict Spinoza (1632–77) denied this too, in his own way, while also arguing for a claim that sounds like a form of materialism: that mind and body are the very same thing ‘expressed in two ways’ (Spinoza [1677] 1988: II, prop. 7, scholium). Other philosophers, such as Hobbes, were more straightforwardly materialists, arguing that the structure and movements of various corporeal systems gave rise to thought. Margaret Cavendish (1623–73), meanwhile, was a materialist who argued that matter itself was fundamentally and irreducibly thinking.
         Hobbesian materialism seeks to explain the mind in terms of the body. Idealism, on the other hand, seeks to explain the body in terms of the mind. This is the view that what there are, fundamentally, are incorporeal thinking things and their states (such as thoughts, ideas and perceptions). Material stuff somehow depends on these more basic things. Leibniz proposed this view at some points, as did George Berkeley (1685–1753).
         Descartes’s views about animals’ lack of minds also continued to attract attention. A wide range of philosophers thought he must have gone wrong here. This debate has complex connections to others. For example, if you believe that animals can think, but you also believe that thought requires an incorporeal soul, what should you say about animals’ incorporeal souls? What happens to them when an animal dies and their body decays?
         Dualist, anti-materialist views were sometimes connected to the notion of simplicity. The idea was that the soul was a simple, indivisible thing, unlike corporeal things such as human brains. Various philosophers thought that they could prove that the soul had to be simple and thus that it could not be corporeal. Leibniz (again), Christian Wolff (1679–1754) and Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) discussed such issues."
10.4324/9780415249126-n014-2,"Education, history of philosophy of","The philosophy of education may be considered a branch of practical philosophy, aimed ultimately at the guidance of an important aspect of human affairs. Its questions thus arise more or less directly from the features of educational practice and the role of education in the promotion of individual and social wellbeing, however much its answers may be conditioned by the larger philosophical and historical settings in which they are posed. Philosophers have concerned themselves with what the aims of education should be, and through what forms of instruction, inquiry and practice those aims might be attained. This demands attention to the contents of instruction and who shall have authority over it. It demands attention to the nature of instruction itself, its circumstances, manner, epistemic dimensions and what is entailed by its reliance on language; the nature of learning and human development, both moral and intellectual; and how all of these are interrelated. The philosophy of education thus stands at the intersection of moral and political philosophy, epistemology, and the philosophy of mind and language, as they bear on the foundations of educational practice.
         The philosophy of education began in classical antiquity with the contentions surrounding the democratization of primary education in Athens and the competing claims of philosophers, sophists, and orators to provide the best higher education. Plato and Aristotle developed systematic theories of education guided by a Socratic ethic of fidelity to reason, and by related aspirations to promote social harmony, political stability, and a just distribution of opportunities to live well. The Stoic descendants of Socrates were expelled from Rome and the oratorical model of higher education deriving from Isocrates was given official sanction, but Augustine re-established the philosophical model through a synthesis of Platonism and Christianity, and in his mature educational thought brought elements of the oratorical and Platonic models together in his account of the Christian teacher’s training.
         The religious wars of the Reformation inspired several philosophical stances toward the relationships of Church, state, school and conscience. Hobbes argued for a consolidation of ecclesiastical and civil authority, with full sovereign authority over education; Locke for religious toleration and private education suitable to producing virtuous, useful, and civic-minded gentlemen; and Rousseau not just for the free development and exercise of the full array of human faculties, but for the establishment of a civic religion limited to the core of shared Christian beliefs that Enlightenment figures from Descartes onward had thought evident to natural reason. Wollstonecraft challenged patriarchal aspects of education, advancing a revolutionary defense of gender equality and a national system of day-schools in which all children would be educated together.
         The Enlightenment’s embrace of science and reason yielded efforts towards the development of a science of learning and pedagogy in the nineteenth century, but also a romantic counter-movement. The industrial revolution, democratic and socialist egalitarian movements, and emergence of state-sponsored schooling prompted new questions that were answered in radically different ways by Nietzsche in the late nineteenth century and Dewey in the early twentieth century."
10.4324/9780415249126-y065-1,Antirealism in the philosophy of mathematics,"Realism in the philosophy of mathematics is the position that takes mathematics at face value. According to realists, mathematics is the science of mathematical objects (numbers, sets, lines and so on); mathematicians, to use the old metaphor, are discoverers, not inventors. Moreover, just as there may be truths about physical reality which we can never know, so too, realists say, there may be truths about mathematical reality which we can never know.
         It is this claim in particular which antirealists find unacceptable. Equating what can be known in mathematics with what can be proved, they insist that only what can be proved is true. (Only what can be proved: different accounts of what this ‘can’ means, facing different difficulties, generate different positions.) This leads antirealists to recoil not only from realism but also from the practice of mathematicians themselves. For the orthodox assumption that every mathematical statement is either true or false would be invalidated, on the antirealist view, by a statement that was neither provable nor disprovable. Not that antirealists themselves can see it in these terms. For if a statement were neither provable nor disprovable, that would itself be an unprovable truth about mathematical reality. Antirealists must learn how to be circumspect even in defence of their own circumspection."
10.4324/9780415249126-y066-1,Realism in the philosophy of mathematics,"Mathematical realism is the view that the truths of mathematics are objective, which is to say that they are true independently of any human activities, beliefs or capacities. As the realist sees it, mathematics is the study of a body of necessary and unchanging facts, which it is the mathematician’s task to discover, not to create. These form the subject matter of mathematical discourse: a mathematical statement is true just in case it accurately describes the mathematical facts.
         An important form of mathematical realism is mathematical Platonism, the view that mathematics is about a collection of independently existing mathematical objects. Platonism is to be distinguished from the more general thesis of realism, since the objectivity of mathematical truth does not, at least not obviously, require the existence of distinctively mathematical objects.
         Realism is in a fairly clear sense the ‘natural’ position in the philosophy of mathematics, since ordinary mathematical statements make no explicit reference to human activities, beliefs or capacities. Because of the naturalness of mathematical realism, reasons for embracing antirealism typically stem from perceived problems with realism. These potential problems concern our knowledge of mathematical truth, and the connection between mathematical truth and practice. The antirealist argues that the kinds of objective facts posited by the realist would be inaccessible to us, and would bear no clear relation to the procedures we have for determining the truth of mathematical statements. If this is right, then realism implies that mathematical knowledge is inexplicable. The challenge to the realist is to show that the objectivity of mathematical facts does not conflict with our knowledge of them, and to show in particular how our ordinary proof-procedures can inform us about these facts."
10.4324/9780415249126-y092-1,"Set theory, philosophy of","The various attitudes that have been taken to mathematics can be split into two camps according to whether they take mathematical theorems to be true or not. Mathematicians themselves often label the former camp realist and the latter formalist. (Philosophers, on the other hand, use both these labels for more specific positions within the two camps.) Formalists have no special difficulty with set theory as opposed to any other branch of mathematics; for that reason we shall not consider their view further here. For realists, on the other hand, set theory is peculiarly intractable: it is very difficult to give an unproblematic explanation of its subject matter.
         The reason this difficulty is not of purely local interest is an after effect of logicism. Logicism, in the form in which Frege and Russell tried to implement it, was a two-stage project. The first stage was to embed arithmetic (Frege) or, more ambitiously, the whole of mathematics (Russell) in the theory of sets; the second was to embed this in turn in logic. The hope was that this would palm off all the philosophical problems of mathematics onto logic. The second stage is generally agreed to have failed: set theory is not part of logic. But the first stage succeeded: almost all of mathematics can be embedded in set theory. So the logicist aim of explaining mathematics in terms of logic metamorphoses into one of explaining it in terms of set theory.
         Various systems of set theory are available, and for most of mathematics the method of embedding is fairly insensitive to the exact system that we choose. The main exceptions to this are category theory, whose embedding is awkward if the theory chosen does not distinguish between sets and proper classes; and the theory of sets of real numbers, where there are a few arguments that depend on very strong axioms of infinity (also known as large cardinal axioms) not present in some of the standard axiomatizations of set theory.
         All the systems agree that sets are extensional entities, so that they satisfy the axiom of extensionality: ∀x(xЄa ≡ xЄb) → a=b. What differs between the systems is which sets they take to exist. A property F is said to be set-forming if {x:Fx} exists: the issue to be settled is which properties are set-forming and which are not. What the philosophy of set theory has to do is to provide an illuminating explanation for the various cases of existence.
         The most popular explanation nowadays is the so-called iterative conception of set. This conceives of sets as arranged in a hierarchy of stages (sometimes known as levels). The bottom level is a set whose members are the non-set-theoretic entities (sometimes known as Urelemente) to which the theory is intended to be applicable. (This set is often taken by mathematicians to be empty, thus restricting attention to what are known as pure sets, although this runs the danger of cutting set theory off from its intended application.) Each succeeding level is then obtained by forming the power set of the preceding one. For this conception three questions are salient:
         Why should there not be any sets other than these? How rich is the power-set operation? How many levels are there?
         An alternative explanation which was for a time popular among mathematicians is limitation of size. This is the idea that a property is set-forming provided that there are not too many objects satisfying it. How many is too many is open to debate. In order to prevent the system from being contradictory, we need only insist that the universe is too large to form a set, but this is not very informative in itself: we also need to be told how large the universe is."
10.4324/9780415249126-y093-1,Fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics,"Fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics is the view that mathematical statements, such as ‘8+5=13’ and ‘∏ is irrational’, are to be interpreted at face value and, thus interpreted, are false. Fictionalists are typically driven to reject the truth of such mathematical statements because these statements imply the existence of mathematical entities, and according to fictionalists there are no such entities. Fictionalism is a nominalist (or antirealist) account of mathematics in that it denies the existence of a realm of abstract mathematical entities. It should be contrasted with mathematical realism (or Platonism) where mathematical statements are taken to be true, and moreover are taken to be truths about mathematical entities. Fictionalism should also be contrasted with other nominalist philosophical accounts of mathematics that propose a reinterpretation of mathematical statements, according to which the statements in question are true but no longer about mathematical entities. Fictionalism is thus an error theory of mathematical discourse: at face value mathematical discourse commits us to mathematical entities; and although we normally take many of the statements of this discourse to be true, in doing so we are in error (cf. error theories in ethics).
         Although fictionalism holds that mathematical statements implying the existence of mathematical entities are strictly speaking false, there is a sense in which these statements are true - they are true in the story of mathematics. The idea here is borrowed from literary fiction, where statements like ‘Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit’ is strictly speaking false (because there are no hobbits), but true in Tolkien’s fiction The Hobbit. Fictionalism about mathematics shares the virtue of ontological parsimony with other nominalist accounts of mathematics. It also lends itself to a very straightforward epistemology: there is nothing to know beyond the human-authored story of mathematics. And coming to know the various fictional claims requires nothing more than knowledge of the story in question. The most serious problem fictionalism faces is accounting for the applicability of mathematics. Mathematics, unlike Tolkien’s stories, is apparently indispensable to our best scientific theories and this, according to some, suggests that we ought to be realists about mathematical entities.
         It is fair to say that there are serious difficulties facing all extant philosophies of mathematics, and fictionalism is no exception. Despite its problems fictionalism remains a popular option in virtue of a number of attractive features. In particular, it endorses a uniform semantics across mathematical and nonmathematical discourse and it provides a neat answer to questions about attaining mathematical knowledge. The major challenge for fictionalism is to provide an adequate account of mathematics in applications."
10.4324/9780415249126-y094-1,Naturalized philosophy of mathematics,"There are three types of naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics: metaphysical, epistemological and methodological. Metaphysical naturalists maintain that all entities are natural. One reading of this claim is that mathematical ontology is the ontology of natural science - which of course leads immediately to the question as to just what ontology is indispensably needed by the natural sciences. Another reading is that all mathematical entities are spatiotemporal. This view faces considerable difficulties, as it seems to go against the claims and methods of mathematics. Epistemological naturalists maintain that we can only know about entities spatiotemporally or causally connected to us. Though prima facie plausible, epistemological naturalism has encountered resistance on many fronts.
         Methodological naturalism sees scientific standards, suitably understood, as authoritative. In its canonical version, science is construed as natural science, and thus the acceptability of mathematics is linked to its role in natural science. The most obvious argument for this form of methodological naturalism is the success argument: natural science is the most successful sphere of human inquiry and should consequently trump other disciplines. However, it turns out that the success argument is difficult to develop convincingly. Some philosophers also believe, controversially, that there is room for a naturalism that takes the authoritative standards in the philosophy of mathematics to be those of mathematics itself."
10.4324/9780415249126-y095-1,Structuralism in the philosophy of mathematics,"Define a system to be a collection of objects with certain relations. A basketball defence is a system of people under various positioning and defence-role relations; an extended family is a system of people under blood and marital relationships; and a chess configuration is a system of pieces under certain spatial and ‘possible move’ relations. A structure is the abstract form of a system, which ignores or abstracts away from any features of the objects that do not bear on the relations.
         The slogan of structuralism is that mathematics is the science of structure. The idea is that the subject matter of a given branch of mathematics is a structure, or a kind of structure. Typically, the structures studied in mathematics are free-standing, in the sense that the various positions or places in the structure are characterized only with respect to each other, and anything at all can play the various roles, and stand in the various relations. Define a ‘natural number system’ to be a countably infinite collection of objects with a designated initial object, a one-to-one successor relation that satisfies the principle of mathematical induction and the other axioms of arithmetic. Examples of natural number systems are the Arabic numerals in their natural order, an infinite sequence of distinct moments of time, and the even natural numbers. According to structuralism, arithmetic is about the form or structure common to natural number systems. So a natural number is something like an office in an organization or a place in a pattern. Similarly, real analysis is about the real number structure, the form common to complete ordered fields.
         Structuralism has certain affinities with functionalist views in, say, philosophy of mind. A functional definition is, in effect, a structural one. The difference, of course, is that mathematical structures are more abstract, and free-standing.
         It is not possible to articulate the structuralist view much further without encountering issues that are contentious, even among those who call themselves structuralists. In some ways, a structure is like a traditional Form or universal. The main difference is that a universal typically applies to or holds of individual objects, or ‘particulars’, while a structure applies to, holds of or is exemplified by, systems – collections of objects under certain relations. Despite this important difference, the usual range of philosophical views concerning universals are available for structures. One can be a Platonist, or ante rem realist, holding that structures exist objectively, independently of, and metaphysically prior to, any systems that exemplify them. Or one can be an Aristotelian, in re realist holding that structures exist only in the systems that exemplify them. Or one can be a nominalist, holding that all talk of structure is to be paraphrased away, in a manner that does not commit one to the existence of structures. This is sometimes called ‘eliminative structuralism’, a structuralism without structures. Some eliminative structuralists think of mathematical assertions as talking about all systems of a certain type; others take such assertions to be talking about all possible systems of a certain type, a sort of modal view. On most of these nominalistic views, mathematical assertions end up objectively true or false, with their usual truth-values.
         A structuralist’s views on other philosophical issues, concerning epistemology, semantics, methodology, applicability and the like, depend on the version of structuralism in question. The ante rem realist, for example, has a straightforward account of reference and semantics: the variables of a branch of mathematics range over the places in an ante rem structure; each singular term denotes one such place, etc. But the ante rem realist must account for how one obtains knowledge of structures, so construed, and for how statements about ante rem structures play a role in scientific theories of the physical world. The eliminative structuralist must account for how the reconstrued statements are known, how they figure in science, etc.; and the modal structuralist must articulate the nature of the invoked modality, and how it is known."
10.4324/9780415249126-z007-1,"African philosophy, Anglophone","Contemporary African philosophy is in a state of flux, but the flow is not without some watersheds. The chief reason for the flux lies in the fact that Africa, in most part, is in a state of transition from a traditional condition to a modernized one. Philosophically and in other ways, the achievement of independence was the most significant landmark in this transition. Independence from European rule (which began in Libya in 1951, followed by Sudan in 1956, Ghana in 1957 and continued to be won at a rapid pace in other parts of Africa in the 1960s) did not come without a struggle. That struggle was, of necessity, both political and cultural. Colonialism involved not only political subjection but also cultural depersonalization. Accordingly, at independence it was strongly felt that plans for political and economic reconstruction should reflect the needs not only for modernization but also for cultural regeneration. These are desiderata which, while not incompatible in principle, are difficult to harmonize in practice. The philosophical basis of the project had first to be worked out and this was attempted by the first wave of post-independence leaders. The task of devising technical philosophies cognizant of Africa’s past and present and oriented to her long-term future has been in the hands of a crop of professional philosophers trained in Western-style educational institutions. Philosophical results have not been as dramatic as in the case of the political, but the process is ongoing.
         The political figures that led African states to independence were not all philosophers by original inclination or training. To start with only the best known, such as Leopold Senghor of Senegal, or Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, were trained philosophers, but others, such as Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, brought only an educated intelligence and a good sense of their national situations to the enterprise. In all cases they were rulers enthusiastically anointed by their people to chart the new course and lead them to the promised land. An example of how practical urgency can inspire philosophical productivity can be found in the way that all these philosophers propounded blueprints for reconstruction with clearly articulated philosophical underpinnings. Circumstantial necessity, then, rather than Platonic selection made these leaders philosopher-kings. It is significant, also, to note that all the leaders mentioned (and the majority of their peers) argued for a system of socialism deriving from their understandings of African traditional thought and practice, and from their perceptions of the imperatives generated by industrialization, such as it had been. Concern with this latter aspect of the situation led to some flirtation and even outright marriage with Marxism. But, according to the leaders concerned, the outcome of this fertilization of thought had enough African input to be regarded as an African progeny. Accordingly, practically all of them proffered their theories and prescriptions under the rubric of African socialism. No such labelling is possible in the work of African philosophers, but there are some patterns of preoccupation."
10.4324/9780415249126-z013-1,"African philosophy, Francophone","The imaginative and intellectual writings that have come out of French-speaking Africa have tended to be associated exclusively with the négritude movement and its global postulation of a black racial identity founded upon an original African essence. Beyond its polemical stance with regard to colonialism, the movement generated a theoretical discourse which served both as a means of self-validation for the African in particular and the black race in general. This discourse developed further as the elaboration of a new worldview derived from the African cultural inheritance of a new humanism that lays claim to universal significance.
         Despite its prominence in the intellectual history of Francophone Africa and in the black world generally, négritude does not account for the full range of intellectual activity among the French-speaking African intelligentsia. The terms of its formulation have been challenged since its inception, leading to ongoing controversy. This challenge concerns the validity of the concept itself and its functional significance in contemporary African thought and collective life. It has involved a debate regarding the essential nature of the African, as well as the possibility of constructing a rigorous and coherent structure of ideas (with an indisputable philosophical status) derived from the belief systems and normative concepts implicit in the institutions and cultural practices subsisting from Africa’s precolonial past.
         The postcolonial situation has enlarged the terms of this debate in French-speaking Africa. It has come to cover a more diverse range of issues touching upon the African experience of modernity. As an extension of the ‘indigenist’ theme which is its point of departure, the cultural and philosophical arguments initiated by the adherents of négritude encompass a critical reappraisal of the Western tradition of philosophy and its historical consequences, as well as a consideration of its transforming potential in the African context. Beyond the essentialism implied by the concept of négritude and related theories of Africanism, the problem at the centre of French-African intellectual preoccupations relates to the modalities of African existence in the modern world.
         From this perspective, the movement of ideas of the French-speaking African intelligentsia demonstrates the plurality of African discourse, as shaped by a continuing crisis of African consciousness provoked by the momentous process of transition to modernity. A convergence can be discerned between the themes and styles of philosophical discourse and inquiry in Francophone Africa and some of the significant currents of twentieth-century European philosophy and social thought engaged with the fundamental human issues raised by the impact of modern technological civilization.
         Two dominant perspectives frame the evolution of contemporary thought and philosophical discourse in French-speaking Africa: the first is related to the question of identity and involves the reclamation of a cultural and spiritual heritage considered to be imperilled; the second relates to what has been called ‘the dilemma of modernity’ experienced as a problematic dimension of contemporary African life and consciousness."
10.4324/9780415249126-z015-1,Egyptian philosophy: influence on ancient Greek thought,"Before the decipherment of hieroglyphics (a process only completed in the 1830s), it was widely believed that many famous Greek philosophers had studied in Egypt and that Greek philosophy was ultimately derived from a lost ’Egyptian mystery system’. This belief was derived in part from ancient sources, which described how certain Greek philosophers had studied with Egyptian priests. The notion that these individual sessions were part of an extensive formal programme of education derives from an historical novel, Séthos (1731), by the Abbé Jean Terrasson. This book, which pretended to be based on lost original sources, offered a detailed portrait of a complex Egyptian university system. It was translated into several European languages and widely popularized in the rituals and mythology of Freemasonry.
         The existence of such a formal Egyptian mystery system of education was not confirmed by actual Egyptian sources once they could be read and translated. The myth has been given a new lease of life in revisionist histories of the ancient world composed by writers whose ancestors had been brought to the New World as slaves. These writers sought to show that Greek philosophy was derived from Egyptian philosophy and that what has been recognized as Western civilization stems from Africa. This entry reviews the evidence for these claims and concludes that although the Greeks had great respect for Egyptian wisdom and piety, what has always been known as Greek philosophy derives from the original work of Greeks. It finds moreover that if the Greek philosophers who lived in Ionia were influenced by any outside ideas, these came to them through the monotheistic religions of other peoples living in the Near East."
10.4324/9780415249126-z016-1,"Ethiopia, philosophy in","Ethiopia is a unique phenomenon in Africa for three reasons. First, because of its historical continuity and political independence; second because of its written language and third because of its written philosophy. Ethiopian philosophy in the broadest sense is expressed in both oral and written language. In this entry only the written documents are dealt with. This methodological approach limits the investigation to linguistic and cultural phenomena as it deals with the ancient Semitic language known as Ethiopic and the Christian zones of influence on the high plateaus of Ethiopia.
         There are five basic texts of Ethiopian philosophical literature: the Physiologue (the Fisalgwos) (c. fifth century ad), The Book of the Wise Philosophers (1510/22), The Life and Maxims of Skendes (c. eleventh century ad), The Treatise of Zar’a Ya‘ecob (1667) and The Treatise of Wäldä Heywåt (c. eighteenth century). The first three are adaptations of works transmitted from Greek sources through Arabic; the latter two (appearing in modern publications in a combined form) are original works of a rationalist flavour."
10.4324/9780415249126-za001-1,Analytical philosophy in Latin America,"In Latin America, philosophical analysis has been portrayed as an intellectual revolution. Its avowed goal has been to replace the abstruseness and obscurantism of scholastic and metaphysical jargon perceived as typical of much of Latin American philosophy with the clarity and rigour of mathematical and scientific discourse. Arriving around the mid-1940s analytic philosophy at first met with little interest because of a shortage of its classics in translation, cultural obstacles and opposition from the more traditional, entrenched philosophies. By the 1960s it had overcome many obstacles and stimulated considerable philosophical activity, mainly in Mexico and Argentina. By the 1980s, in spite of political opposition, analysis had created an international forum for the discussion of philosophical problems. It attracted to its ranks several distinguished philosophers and scientists with philosophical interests, among them Mario Bunge (Argentina and Canada), Héctor-Neri Castañeda (Guatemala and the USA) and Francisco Miró Quesada (Peru). An ambitious translation effort was launched and several important journals were founded, such as Análisis filosófico (Philosophical Analysis), Revista latinoamericana de filosofía (Latin American Journal of Philosophy) (Argentina), Crítica. Revista hispanoamericana de filosofía (Criticism. Hispanoamerican Journal of Philosophy) (Mexico), Manuscrito (Manuscript) (Brazil) and Diálogos (Dialogues) (Puerto Rico)."
10.4324/9780415249126-z025-1,"South Africa, philosophy in","Although it is incorrect to refer to an independent South African philosophical tradition, South Africa is nevertheless the location of an interesting history of philosophical institutionalization. This institutionalization is closely intertwined with the colonial and postcolonial history of Western expansion (Dutch and English) and the reactions it unleashed within the South African context. It is especially interesting to trace the influence and the application of Anglo-American and continental origins in South Africa. Even in contemporary South Africa, philosophers who are working in fields such as postmodernism, postcolonialism, feminism and analytical philosophy do so mostly under the influence of contexts beyond South Africa’s borders.
         After the early Dutch influence in South Africa (1652–1806) a British colonial educational system emerged during the nineteenth century. From the first institutions of higher education (the South African College in Cape Town, and the University of the Cape of Good Hope) the first tertiary institutions emerged in the early part of the twentieth century at Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Witwatersrand (Johannesburg) and Pretoria. Although other universities were subsequently instituted, these four can be considered the four founding residential universities in South Africa. It is also at these universities (and at Colleges in Grahamstown, Bloemfontein, Durban and Pietermaritzburg) that British idealism had a major influence on the early stages of South African philosophy (1873–1940). Against this background figures such as Fremantle (Cape Town), Walker (Stellenbosch), Hoernlé (Johannesburg), Lord (Grahamstown) and Macfadyen (Pretoria) were instrumental.
         From the 1930s the hegemony of British idealism was challenged by analytical philosophy (mainly at English-speaking South African universities) and continental traditions (mainly at Afrikaans-speaking universities). Since the political transformation of South Africa (1994) African philosophy has also emerged as a major philosophical tradition.
         The challenge for philosophy in contemporary South Africa is to explore those intellectual traditions that have shaped philosophy in South Africa, to know where they are coming from and to understand how they were transformed under (post)colonial conditions. Such a (genealogical) perspective provides a historical and material corrective to arguments that might otherwise strive to reconcile cultural values and ideas in an apolitical and ahistorical manner."
10.4324/9780415249126-za003-1,"Argentina, philosophy in","Philosophy has been present throughout Argentine cultural life since the beginning of Spanish colonization. Despite institutional ups and downs, the teaching of philosophy was a practically constant component of higher and even secondary education. The principal currents that shaped that teaching for more than three centuries were Scholasticism, French ideology, eclectic spiritualism, positivism and in the twentieth century, all of the contemporary manifestations, such as, Husserlian phenomenology, existentialism, analytical philosophy and structuralism. A permanent characteristic, nevertheless, has been that the political vicissitudes of the country affected educational institutions.
         In the nineteenth century, during the period of national independence and organization, public figures used philosophical ideas to analyse the problems of society and to make the political and institutional contributions that a country in formation required. Juan Bautista Alberdi and Domingo Sarmiento are, in this respect, two representative examples.
         In the twentieth century, the figure of the professional philosopher, one who is interested in philosophical research for itself, emerged and expanded. However, thought that reflected direct interest in the problems of the community and in the ethical demands of praxis did not disappear during this era. This can be seen in such thinkers as José Ingenieros and Alejandro Korn and more recently in what has been called liberation philosophy.
         Academic philosophy has made considerable progress. In the second half of the twentieth century, it has attained a high level of professional quality. In some cases, even original contributions have been made which go beyond assimilation or commentary about external philosophical influences.
         In Argentina, as in the rest of Latin America, philosophy began as a pure transplant brought by those who conquered the continent. Upon creating centres of higher education (either as part of the religious orders or with the character of universities), the philosophical teaching being practised in the Spanish universities of Salamanca and Alcalá was reproduced in the Spanish colonies.
         Argentine philosophy shares the same general characteristics and historical periods with the philosophies developed in other Latin American countries. In general terms, philosophy can be divided into three periods: the colonial period, the nineteenth century, or national period and the twentieth century."
10.4324/9780415249126-za004-1,"Brazil, philosophy in",It is possible to distinguish between European philosophy in Brazil and Brazilian philosophy. The former refers to Brazilians who participate in discussions of issues occurring in the European philosophic tradition without any reference to Brazilian reality and its problems; the latter to those Brazilian intellectuals who respond to the problems growing out of situations which have confronted the nation historically whether their philosophical orientations have originated in Europe or elsewhere. This entry focuses on the latter and generally follows a historical progression. This progression spans from the precabralian Tupi-Guarani speaking societies of eastern South America to the healthy development of Brazilian philosophy since 1950 after the founding of the Institute of Brazilian Philosophy.

Some of the original intentions of liberation philosophy were to make poor and marginalized people the subjects, or authors, of philosophy and to collaborate in the process of distancing philosophy from academia and exclusively professional settings. Social conflict and pressing national needs were topics of debate at that time. All thought started with the recognition and assessment of the experience of alterity. Horacio Cerutti-Guldberg has proposed the phrase ‘philosophies for liberation’ as this kind of reflection deals with multiple philosophical positions and privileges the historical process over philosophy."
10.4324/9780415249126-za010-1,"Literature, philosophy in Latin American","Within the Latin American intellectual community, the relationship between philosophy and literature constitutes one of the most interesting chapters in its development. Much Latin American literature is characterized by profound philosophical concerns, focusing on the question of identity. From the time of the conquest and colonization of the American continent in the 1500s, a debate regarding the humanity of the recently discovered inhabitants began in Spain. This debate would prove to be one of the most revealing controversies of sixteenth-century Europe. At the point of colonial expansion, Europe projected a logocentric vision which would incite a unique Latin Americanist philosophical discourse relating to the question of identity.
         During the nineteenth century, philosophical discourse was formulated principally through literary expression. At first the quest for a cultural identity was the philosophical focus, although two conflicting positions were evident: the desire to achieve cultural independence from Europe and a yearning for Latin America to become European. This latter position inspired the urge to identify with European culture and from the mid-1900s, with the political and economic success of the USA.
         In the twentieth century, from the time of the University Reform of 1918, an academic philosophy emerged close to that of Europe and began to diversify the Latin American philosophical panorama. From the various philosophical stances which arose at that time, one that dominated the cultural arena, despite its occasional relegation to a secondary position in academia, was the urge to articulate a Latin Americanist philosophical discourse which would succeed in transcending its own frontiers through liberation philosophy, beginning in the 1960s."

Such thinking was rediscovered through laborious translation of surviving fragments of a document of exceptional value known as ‘Coloquio de los Doce’ (Debate of the Twelve) (1524). Since then, philosophy has come to enjoy a high degree of professionalization and a high quality of academic production. Generally, Mexican philosophical activity has evolved in accordance with world standards of rigour, information and quality of argumentation. In the twentieth century various philosophical groups have been created, namely the Ateneo de la Juventud, the contemporáneos and the Hyperion group.
         Leopoldo Zea understood the essence of the Mexican and the Latin American as a historical being with a historically situated consciousness. Zea’s history of ideas involved a philosophy of Latin American history which placed the being, destiny and meaning of the history of Mexico and Latin America in the context of the history of the world. The 1940s and 1950s were unusually productive to this end. In the 1970s small groupings of philosophers gathered to focus on problems, traditions, teaching figures, leaders and spheres of influence.
         There has been considerable interest in political philosophy, philosophy of history, philosophy of science and ethics. Since the 1980s, works about the history of ideas in Mexico and the history of science and technology have proliferated."
10.4102/td.v14i1.465,Rethinking corruption in contemporary African philosophy: Old wine cannot fit,"To conceive the notion of corruption presupposes the existence of corrupt individuals, groups or organisations. The existence of corrupt individuals, groups or organisations you might say presupposes the presence of an entity. Every entity (i.e. state or corporate) has laid down procedures, processes and methods of doings and functioning. When these procedures and processes are negated, one could be accused of subversion. Subversion is an element in the definition of administrative corruption and is the unwillingness to follow stipulated plans of actions. An action that negates procedures falls under corrupt practice. This article will answer the following research questions: How has corruption been framed and perceived and what are the underlining consequences in Africa? In what ways, if any, has the prevailing perception of corruption undermined and understated the notion of corruption in Africa? In what ways can a remedial be conceived in the fight to make Africa free of corruption? And finally: How can Kleptoafronia be conceived as a panacea for corruption in the continent? This article uses themes and narrative analysis in the qualitative realm to provide answers to the research questions. Over 500 scholarly materials were read and scanned from journal articles, Internet sources, textbooks and several academic indexes to provide evidence for the arguments in this article from five disciplinary standpoints: political science, public administration, criminology, psychology and medical sciences. This article is a conceptual article that tends to demonstrate that corruption in Africa is a psych-administrative disorder termed – Kleptoafronia."

However, if this is left to the school alone, the children’s most important educational environment—the family—is neglected. The Community of Inquiry (COI), developed by Matthew Lipman into an educational methodology, aims at educating students to be critical citizens by developing habits of mind through collaborative philosophical inquiry. The research reported here was targeted at introducing the COI into the family, particularly addressing the intersubjective relationships among participants. In Uruguay, ‘Community Teachers’ visit disadvantaged homes to follow children’s progress and to increase the retention rates. Two Participatory Action Research activities were implemented in 2012 and 2016, in which sixty Community Teachers were trained in the COI methodology and applied it to their work with families. The observations made suggest the COI can support the promotion of human development from the very heart of the family."

10.1017/hgl.2018.13,Deleuze and Guattari’s ‘War Machine’ as a Critique of Hegel’s Political Philosophy,"Abstract
	  This paper elaborates Deleuze and Guattari’s ‘war machine’ in relation to key theses in Hegel’s political philosophy, with the aim of showing how it illuminates the conditions under which politics and political institutions as Hegel understands them both emerge and are compromised. After first introducing the idea of the war machine and its appropriation by discussing it in relation to Carl Schmitt’s theory of partisan warfare, it examines both the war machine and Hegel’s theory of the State by way of a focus on Hegel’s discussions of drive (Trieb) and semblance (Schein). Regarding the first, the paper explores how both Hegel and Deleuze and Guattari conceive of social structure in terms of a structure of drives even while they differ in their understandings of the drives in relation to desire and subjectivity. Regarding the second, the paper explores how moments of semblance identified by Hegel as he develops his system of Right reveal points where the war machine can emerge from within State structures. The paper argues that the war machine concept challenges understandings of politics built on friend/enemy antagonisms and the use of external conflict to secure internal unity, the former being Schmitt’s explicit political project and the second being the place at which Hegel’s project ultimately finds itself when it fails to secure the rational structure of Ethical Life."
10.1128/mbio.01539-17,Graduate Biomedical Science Education Needs a New Philosophy,"ABSTRACT
                  There is a growing realization that graduate education in the biomedical sciences is successful at teaching students how to conduct research but falls short in preparing them for a diverse job market, communicating with the public, and remaining versatile scientists throughout their careers. Major problems with graduate level education today include overspecialization in a narrow area of science without a proper grounding in essential critical thinking skills. Shortcomings in education may also contribute to some of the problems of the biomedical sciences, such as poor reproducibility, shoddy literature, and the rise in retracted publications. The challenge is to modify graduate programs such that they continue to generate individuals capable of conducting deep research while at the same time producing more broadly trained scientists without lengthening the time to a degree. Here we describe our first experiences at Johns Hopkins and propose a manifesto for reforming graduate science education."
10.1017/s0031819100050336,Towards a Critical Historiography: Recent Work in Philosophy of History,"A British historian might be excused for looking slightly askance at any collection of recent books relating to the philosophy of history. This is because we have been told, several times over and by distinguished members of the profession, that such speculative and analytic activity has little, if anything, to do with the actual business of historiography. One of the most forthright warnings was delivered on the very first page of Professor G. R. Elton'sThe Practice of History(1967), when we were advised that: ‘Every new number ofHistory and Theoryis liable to contain yet another article struggling to give history a philosophic base, and some of them are interesting. But they do not, I fear, advance the writing of history’. For Elton, therefore, there could be little point in granting his colleague in another discipline the right to assess the cognitive claims of historiography. The historian himself, and he alone, was qualified to determine, for all practical purposes, the aims and applications of historical method. It was left to the late Arnold Toynbee to diagnose (inToynbee on Toynbee, 1974) the dangers in this protectionist approach. He claimed that Elton was ‘trying deliberately to create a closed circuit of “professional” historians’ which was, in his opinion, ‘fatal to any form of study’. But of course Toynbee's own lack of standing within the historical profession could be put forward as a telling index of the dangers of transgressing the barriers between history and philosophy."
10.31874/2309-1606-2016-18-1-94-116,Contemporary Global Transformation of  University System and the Philosophy of Education Specifications in Anglo-Saxon and American Models of Education and Research Management,"In today’s world there is diversification of different models of higher education. At the same time, the multiplicity, the diversity of higher education models does not exclude their identity. Internationalization and integration of higher education in a global and international dimension raise a lot of new questions to the theory and practice. Almost every developed country has the rich experience of building the higher education system. The analysis of this experience can aid development and enrichment of the national educational system; it provides an opportunity to avoid repeating the same mistakes and to discover the new approaches to solving some problems in this area. Therefore, based on this, we consider that it is impossible to claim the creation of the strategy of modernization educational and scientific reforms, which affect the educational and scientific institution of the society in the management of scientific and educational space without analysis of the existing models, schools, directions, their classification in contemporary philosophy of education. It concern as well the sphere of the social philosophy of education as the sphere of management of education. The continuity of public education, qualitative management, their intensity can only be achieved under two conditions of the fundamental character. The first one is use of new, theoretically grounded and practically proven management, philosophically developed, accessible and technically supported high technology of social activity, education, training, and learning. The second condition is the perfect acquisition of the methodology of socio-axiological and research activity. The structure must provide the same conditions for equitable selection of civil, educational and scientific-educational actions, excluding coercion and domination. It is noted that the existence of developed civil society among the existing conditions and prerequisites for the successful formation and functioning of educational systems and effective models of multilevel educational management is necessary. Thus, we can conclude that the strategy of the modern world development proposed by the social philosophy of upbringing and education is a key in the field of social administration, philosophy, and pedagogy. This is what we exactly mean by education, science or some of the paradigms of upbringing and education as a dominant one on a certain socio-historical stage. This understanding largely depends on the manner of organization and functioning of civil society in the present and future."

It is noted that the implementation process of humanization of contemporary educational and scientific space determined by objective laws of social and cultural development at the end of the last century actualizes the necessity of teaching philosophical disciplines in higher technical education. Based on the statement of transhistorical connection between the university as an institution that aims to provide students with a comprehensive training and philosophy as a universal type of knowledge, the author underlines the significance of philosophyin the moral and cultural education and professional development of contemporary engineers. It is analyzed two key dimensions of philosophy in the structure of present-day university education such as personal and critical. These dimensions promote universal competence of future professionals and methodology that focuses on the humanistic dimension of science and allows them to identify actual problems of natural and technical sciences. Research of the future ways of philosophy implication to educational and scientific activities of technical universities gave an opportunity to state the need for their comprehensive reorganization of the contents of different types of educational and scientific activities towards the study of the world view and methodological dimensions of contemporary scientific and technological development. Particular attention is paid to the potential of philosophy in the development of communicative abilities, and the importance of working out of original philosophical texts in the context of becoming the critical thinking of students and their value orientations."
10.31874/2309-1606-2016-18-1-221-237,Philosophy and Philosophical Education in Kazimierz Twardowski’s Interpretation,"Philosophy determination, its place and purpose in human life and society is the eternal philosophical problem. In this paper the reader is suggested to analyze the attempt of its solving by outstanding Polish philosopher Kazimierz Twardowski. Free from the extremes of metaphysics and minimalism, Kazimierz Twardowski’s philosophy has not only created the conditions for philosophical culture development, but has also brought up a pleiad of philosophically educated scientists. What are the peculiarities of Kazimierz Twardowski’s philosophy? On the bases of philosophical papers analysis, scientific and historical definition of the concept of philosophy has been carried out. It is proved, that the scientific concept of philosophy, as one of the components of polylogue manifestation of the human spirit, dissolves in historical concept of philosophy. Such philosophy understandingbrought the philosopher to the conclusion about vital human and social necessity in philosophy. If a man and society do not feel the necessity in philosophy, due to the lack of their spiritual culture, this necessity should be grown. Therefore, the care about philosophical education was one of the main goals of Twardowski’s life. The scientist interpreted philosophical education as a part of general education. He determined philosophy studies as a way of life and a school of thinking. Due to this, Twardowski believed that method studying as natural means of knowledge and self-cognition is a humane act promoting creating man’s own view of the world. Special understanding of the philosophy and the background of its development – philosophical education by talented scientist and teacher – encourages reflection on the problems in the field of Ukrainian philosophy. Philosophical and pedagogical understanding of Twardowski’s experience is relevant in the context of increasing complexity of modern relationships between a man and society. "

10.1192/bjp.157.1.111,Philosophy and Medicine: the Oxford Connection,"Three aspects of the approach to philosophy advocated by the Oxford philosopher J. L. Austin are outlined: his conception of the nature of philosophical problems, essentially as a mixed bag; his method of linguistic analysis, namely, clarification of our concepts by active observation of the ways in which they are actually used rather than by passive reflection on their meanings; and his views on the organisation of philosophical research, that in some areas it should be pursued rather as a science is pursued, as a corporate rather than merely individual venture. It is suggested that Austin's approach provides the basis for a potentially fruitful two-way relationship between philosophical theory and medical practice."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-6-135-139,Three Conditions of Contemporary Social Philosophy Criticism,"In this article we reveal the common conditions of modern social philosphy (poststructuralism, neo-Marxism, analytical philosophy of history), which theoretical discourse is subordinated to critical discourse, as distinguished from the canonical I. Kant’s, G. Hegel’s, M. Heidegger’s, M. Sheller’s J.-P. Sartre’s philosophical theories, which are bonded with the development of positivist epistemological, historical, ontological or anthropological presuppositions. We will talk about tree main conditions: 1) decline of theological definition of subject, 2) mechanism of repetition, 3) interdisciplinarity. In the first case, we will discuss transition from subject definition through the God to his definition through the figure of Other, which allows philosophers as Schopenhauer, Nietzsche or Sheller expose metaphysics with consistent methodological criticism. In the second case, we will talk about forming of critical discourse establishing itself as the extended analog of psychoanalytical revealing of unconsciousness content. In the third case, we will examine interdisciplinary approach, assuming combination of different methods possible to increase this criticism and put empirical borders of its theoretical presuppositions."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-6-155-159,Fear as an Object of Social Philosophy,"Social philosophy as a discipline has a number of standard research topics at its disposal, such as the search for the best form of government, the elucidation of the laws of the development of society, the problem of free will and will to power, etc., while the study of the phenomenon of fear is knocked out of this series and is not prerogative of social philosophy. However, upon closer examination, the problem of fear is extremely urgent for social philosophy, and some of its aspects can be correctly interpreted only when using optics and the methodology of this field of scientific knowledge. In this article, we are talking about the peculiarities of the phenomenon of fear, which has an impact on a specific individual in particular and on society as a whole. The author strives to isolate those features that distinguish fear from the total number of problems of modern societies and to present fear as a phenomenon that can not be analyzed only with the help of the means of the natural sciences. Having these features determined, we will understand the need to examine the phenomenon of fear in studying the state of modern societies as well as social philosophy will possess the necessary tools for this analysis."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-6-143-147,The Subject of Social Philosophy in the Context of Contemporary Challenges,"The article considers the transformation of social philosophy object in the context of modern social development challenges. The author proves the actual idea that contemporary social philosophy, retaining its traditional object scope, is transformed due to fast social changes. According to the author, it is caused by following challenges: change of person problem status in social philosophy object field, theoretical sociological knowledge influence, knowledge structures evolution, new methodological approaches, including social constructivism, and geopolitical and modern civilization development challenges. Contemporary social philosophy, describing the picture of social transformations, underlines the transition from the interpretation of historical process as a change of external world to its interpretation as a process of human self-development, his self-change and self-realization. That is why contemporary post-industrial society, orientated on an innovation development, actualizes problematic of human potential and human capital development. The author concludes that the object of social philosophy undergoes substantial changes, and its problems are considered from a new perspective."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-6-139-143,Under the Sign of Finitude: Social Philosophy as Empirical Philosophy,"This article outlines an approach to social philosophy as empirical philosophy. Each philosophical act is localized and performed by a particular author in a particular context and agenda. Based on ideas of Kant, Heidegger, Foucault, it is suggested to understand this fact through double structure of finitude. On the one hand, social scientist within his finite existence is produced by the complex of instances, each bearing particular existence and historicity, such as language, social patterns, gender, etc. The fact that he is always-already produced by the world and entangled in it implies that his thinking is potentially contaminated by meanings imposed by these instances. On the other hand, his knowledge is finite that means inherent divide between social reality and discourse about it. This position of a social scientist implies the feautures of social philosophy approach, such as instrumentalization of concepts, separation of method from ontology, empiricism, plasticity of borders of the social and its historicity. In conclusion several examples of the approach are provided."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-6-131-135,Social Philosophy and Interdisciplinarity,"The present article considers the problematical nature of social philosophy’s interdisciplinary character. The author considers that we can discover its specification as an independent area of the humanities, with exarticulation of adjacent to social philosophy disciplines like political philosophy, historic sociology and social theory. If it will be done, we will be able as the scientists to prove that social philosophy, which if often considering as the synonymous of social theory, has right to exist. The author comes to conclusion that the most part of social theory supporters try to ignore valuative dimension in “theories” of thinkers they research (Georg Simmel, Hanna Arendt, Juergen Habermas, Zygmunt Bauman). In fact it is а duty of social philosophy which nature is valuative. In author’s point of view, such a trend in theoretical sociology as “cultural sociology,” which use not only explanatory and descriptive methods but also interpretations, reflects the differences between social theory and social philosophy because it emphasizes the cultural dimension of social processes. For example, cultural sociology deals with issues that are more relevant to philosophy than to sociology, in particular, it concerns the problem of evil."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-6-123-127,On the Subject of Social Philosophy,"Social philosophy is knowledge that is called to answer the question about the goals of human existence and human historical life. In this sense, it is a valuative philosophy. This determines the specificity and boundaries of its object. It includes: 1) society as self-organizing system of sociality reproduction, 2) historical process in its relation with value meanings and constants of human existence, and 3) social epistemology, exploring the possibilities and ways of adequately social reality comprehension. Social philosophy conceptually crosses theoretical sociology and the philosophy of history within the boundaries of its problem field. The main theme of social philosophy is a theme of human, focusing research interest on the question “Who are we and where are we going?” Today boundaries of social philosophy are blurring under the postmodern influence on the humanities. Philosophical vision of social reality is replaced by the description of narratives designed by communicative practice that cannot be represented as a whole and do not obey to general analytical logic. This actualizes an appeal to social philosophy as a way of explanation of socio-cultural realities and, in this connection, to the problematics specifying the existing ideas about its object."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-6-127-131,Two Ways of Constructing Social Philosophy,"The article discusses the question of what social philosophy is and how it is constructed. On the one hand, this is an area of philosophy that focuses on a set of social problems and attributes through the lens of the naturalistic research program, which considers these attributes as similar to some type of “things.” On the other hand, cultural-centric program solves the question of how and when philosophy itself became social: starting with modernity and its processional characteristics, i.e. - in the first, in the second and the third modernity, in the processes of globalization and other social transformations, in processionality of identity, ethnicity, etc. Both modes of research are outlined, and emphasis is placed on the advantages of the cultural-centrist research program. The philosophy of the first - liberal modernity of the 19 th century, the second - organized modernity of the 20th century, the processes of the 21 st century, opening up a new type of modernity - new Modernity for non-Western countries, is the social philosophy of processes, paying special attention not to the aspectual, quasi-concrete interpretation of the summable features of social reality but to processes."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-6-147-151,Social Philosophy as Problem-Oriented Knowledge,"The article examines the main meanings of the concept of “social philosophy” and reveals three such meanings. First, social philosophy presents the views of a particular thinker (from antiquity to the present day) on society and its nature. Second, social philosophy is the study of the most general laws of development of nature and society (scientific philosophy). Third, social philosophy is a value- worldview analysis of the most urgent and complex problems of social development, including philosophical (worldview) criticism of the prevailing ideas in this society and the search for constructive value alternatives. The author adheres to the third approach to understanding the meaning of social philosophy and gives two examples of socio-philosophical work: 1) analysis of the problem of labor in Russia in the context of the dominance of the theory of ‘catching up’ modernization; 2) analysis of the problem of democracy in the context of prevailing ideas about the inevitability of political authoritarianism as the main path of development of Russian civilization."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-6-151-155,From Social Sciences to Philosophy and Back Again,"The article is devoted to the problem of the demarcation of social sciences from social philosophy. The author proposes to model the relations between these two disciplines as a continuum instead of binary opposition - a continuum in which certain authors and concepts are located depending on the nature of their statements (descriptive or prescriptive/evaluative) and the amount of empirical data involved. To illustrate a number of this continuum’s positions and features, the concept of the sacred is brought: emerging in Modern history as a cultural idea, in the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries in the works of French sociologists it becomes an empirical model that describes both the effect of social solidarity and the particular forms of religious existence. However, later, in the College of Sociology and in the works of such thinkers as G. Bataille, R. Caillois, etc., the concept acquires value meanings and becomes socio-philosophical. The absence of a clear boundary between the two statement formats, it makes possible both the “drifting” from one to another over time (M. Eliade) and the ambiguity of any critics of social science from social philosophy’s position and vice versa. At the same time, the historical “load” of the concept could be discarded in order to use it within the framework of “pure” social science or philosophy."
10.14746/prt.2018.2.12,Critique of Pure Unconsciousness: Some Remarks on the Impact of Kant’s Philosophy on Gilles Deleuze’s and Félix Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus,"Wbrew popularnym interpretacjom filozofii Deleuze’a jako odmiany postmodernizmu, poststrukturalizmu bądź nietzscheanizmu w artykule przedstawione zostaną jej głębokie korzenie pochodzące z idealizmu transcendentalnego Immanuela Kanta. Postawiona zostaje teza, iż to właśnie Kant stanowił podstawowe źródło filozoficznych schematów inspirujących Deleuze’a zarówno we wczesnym okresie jego twórczości (wyrażonym przede wszystkim w Różnicy i powtórzeniu, 1968), jak i późnym, zapoczątkowanym wraz z Félixem Guattarim przez pierwszy tom Kapitalizmu i schizofrenii, czyli Anty-Edypa (1972). Kontekstowa analiza tego ostatniego stanowi główną część artykułu. W Anty-Edypie Deleuze i Guattari proponują koncepcję pragnienia (nieświadomości) jako siły konstytuującej podmiotowość nomadyczną, otwartą na inność, kreatywną i czerpiącą siłę z różnorodności społecznej. Zauważają jednak, że pragnienie cechuje skłonność do poddawania się wewnętrznym iluzjom i w efekcie blokowania własnych, rewolucyjnych i twórczych możliwości. Właśnie dlatego, twierdzą Deleuze i Guattari, konieczne jest przeprowadzenie krytyki czystej nieświadomości, mającej ujawnić te złudzenia i być może uwolnić nas od nich."
10.1515/janeh-2018-0010,The Reluctant En of Inana — or the Persona of Gilgameš in the Perspective of Babylonian Political Philosophy,"Abstract
Both the literary tradition and historical data proper indicate that, during the first few centuries of third millennium BC, Babylonian kingship underwent a significant transformation. While the original leaders of city-states were primarily ritual officials, beginning at ca. 2900–2800 various individuals began emancipating themselves from their ritual roles and the concomitant power of temple households, becoming instead purely secular officials, who strived to establish an independent power base for themselves, and to create hereditary dynastic lines. This paper argues that the paragon of this development was Gilgameš, the presumed early king of Uruk, as his persona and accomplishments are presented in the Sumerian and Akkadian literary sources. Toward that end, various compositions devoted to Gilgameš are discussed, in particular, “Gilgameš, Enkidu, and the Netherworld.”"
10.1515/janeh-2018-0004,Theses on Babylonian Philosophy,"Abstract
Through an enumeration of six theses this article argues that there was indeed a system of thought in ancient Babylonia that we can call philosophy, despite what the famous mid-twentieth century ad book Before Philosophy. The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man maintained. We can discover the principles of systematic thought in the numerous lists that Babylonians and other writers of cuneiform in the ancient Near East used. The key to philosophical understanding lay in the idea that writing produced a truth of its own, distinct from what was observable in physical reality."
10.3390/philosophies3040030,Time and Life in the Relational Universe: Prolegomena to an Integral Paradigm of Natural Philosophy,"Relational ideas for our description of the natural world can be traced to the concept of Anaxagoras on the multiplicity of basic particles, later called “homoiomeroi” by Aristotle, that constitute the Universe and have the same nature as the whole world. Leibniz viewed the Universe as an infinite set of embodied logical essences called monads, which possess inner view, compute their own programs and perform mathematical transformations of their qualities, independently of all other monads. In this paradigm, space appears as a relational order of co-existences and time as a relational order of sequences. The relational paradigm was recognized in physics as a dependence of the spatiotemporal structure and its actualization on the observer. In the foundations of mathematics, the basic logical principles are united with the basic geometrical principles that are generic to the unfolding of internal logic. These principles appear as universal topological structures (“geometric atoms”) shaping the world. The decision-making system performs internal quantum reduction which is described by external observers via the probability function. In biology, individual systems operate as separate relational domains. The wave function superposition is restricted within a single domain and does not expand outside it, which corresponds to the statement of Leibniz that “monads have no windows”."
10.1017/s0034412515000360,Why not believe in an evil God? Pragmatic encroachment and some implications for philosophy of religion,"AbstractPointing to broad symmetries between the idea that God is omniscient, omnipotent, and all-good, and the idea that God is omniscient, omnipotent, but all-evil, the evil-God challenge raises the question of why theists should prefer one over the other. I respond to this challenge by drawing on a recent theory in epistemology, pragmatic encroachment, which asserts that practical considerations can alter the epistemic status of beliefs. I then explore some of the implications of my argument for how we do philosophy of religion, arguing that practical and contextual as well as alethic considerations are properly central to the discipline."
10.21476/pp.2017.3187,�Alive� Performance: Toward an Immersive Activist Philosophy,"This paper proposes to analyse the �virtual,� unsighted potentials of the artistic and critical practice of performance through abstraction, deconstruction and remediation of its �body.� It argues that the ontological distinction between material and immaterial representation can be dislodged by the proposition of? an ontogenesis of emergence of the dynamic dimension of affect. Such self-organising, recursive system of forces and energies elicits change and transformation expanding the sensual and aesthetic practice of performance as alive art.These arguments connect concepts from aesthetic and political theory with philosophical ideas of virtual multiplicity, relationality, counter/intuition and (dis)individuation passing via the work of Brian Massumi, Teresa Brennan, as well as other theorists. The approach intersects methodologies and epistemologies from activist philosophy, science and art with the radical contingencies implicit in performance as a �technology of existence� (in)formed by tendencies of distribution of affective intensities and temporal (re)modulation of shared perception.Ultimately, I propose to imagine performance as a vital archive of perceptive experience marked by a representational impossibility, a failure to appear fully. This actual condition of emergent abstraction enables however a bodily state of intensity and emergency to flesh out an experiential, visceral field of affective modes of becoming and becoming-other in related mo(ve)ments of aliveness traversed by the ungrasped pulse of a past yet to be/come."
10.1093/oso/9780195307771.003.0023,“Promising” Ideas: Hobbes and contract in Spinoza’s political philosophy,"Like Hobbes, Spinoza prominently invokes promising and contracts (covenants) in his discussion of the foundations of the state—primarily, but not exclusively, in his Theological-Political Treatise. His understanding of their nature and significance, however, differs in important ways from that of Hobbes. This chapter poses four related puzzles concerning Spinoza’s claims about promises and contracts as they invoke or relate specifically to Hobbes: “whether the right of nature is preserved intact”; whether “reason urges peace in all circumstances”; whether breaking a promise is ever “in accordance with reason”; and whether one is obligated to keep a pledge extorted by a robber. Next, it analyzes and compares the doctrines of Hobbes and Spinoza on several key topics: rights and powers, good and evil, reason and passion, and faith and deception (both “evil deception” [“dolus malus”] and “good deception” [“dolus bonus”]). Finally, it employs these doctrines to resolve the four puzzles."
10.1093/oso/9780195307771.001.0001,Necessity and Nature in Spinoza's Philosophy,"Spinoza’s guiding commitment to the thesis that nothing exists or occurs outside of the scope of nature and its necessary laws makes him one of the great seventeenth-century exemplars of both philosophical naturalism and explanatory rationalism. Nature and Necessity in Spinoza’s Philosophy brings together for the first time eighteen articles by Don Garrett on Spinoza’s philosophy, ranging over the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, ethics, and political philosophy. Taken together, they provide a comprehensive analysis of Spinoza’s theories of substance, thought and extension, causation, truth, knowledge, individuation, representation, consciousness, conatus, teleology, emotion, freedom, responsibility, virtue, contract, the state, and eternity—and of the deep interrelations among them. Each article aims to resolve problems in the interpretation of Spinoza’s philosophy in such a way as to make evident both his reasons for his views and the enduring value of his ideas. At the same time, they elucidate the relations between his philosophy and those of such predecessors and contemporaries as Aristotle, Hobbes, Descartes, Locke, and Leibniz. The book also offers four important and substantial new replies to leading critics on four crucial topics: the necessary existence of God (Nature), substance monism, necessitarianism, and consciousness."

The chapters range widely over issues in general jurisprudence (the nature of law, adjudication, and legal reasoning), the philosophical foundations of specific areas of law (from criminal law to evidence to international law), the history of legal philosophy, and related philosophical topics that illuminate the problems of legal theory."
10.1093/oso/9780198808282.003.0003,"Religion, history, and philosophy","The chapter provides a survey of the distinction between religious and philosophical reflection, and commentary on ways that have been tried in the past of relating them to each other and to science. The word ‘religion’ itself requires definition; if different people adopt different definitions then they may, on this basis, find themselves engaged in unproductive disputes. Philosophy also can sometimes misconceive what theological discourse is. This is illustrated through reactions to Thomas Aquinas. The attempt to separate science and religion as a separation between facts and meaning, process and value (‘NOMA’), is considered. The attempt has some positive features, but ultimately fails. Deism is discussed as an historical experiment which also failed."
10.1093/oso/9780190680640.003.0007,The Star of Redemption as a System of Philosophy,"This chapter explains why Schelling and Rosenzweig hold that the representation of God by finite human beings is a topic of practical philosophy. Like Schelling’s Philosophical Investigations into the Essence of Human Freedom and his Ages of the World fragments, Rosenzweig’s Star of Redemption is motivated by an attempt to provide an explanation for the existence of the finite world, for the condition that brings about the relation between subject and object that characterizes all states of human consciousness. The system that Rosenzweig develops in the Star invites us to consider our commitments, the values that we ascribe to ourselves when we form maxims for action, as the means through which abstract concepts of the good are cognized. On Rosenzweig’s view, our commitments are the site of reason’s revelation; for this reason, God is both cognized and realized through human action in the world."
10.1093/oso/9780195307771.003.0020,"Representation, Misrepresentation, and Error in Spinoza’s Philosophy of Mind","Spinoza seems to commit himself to two implausible doctrines about representation: (1) that no idea can represent what is not the case and (2) that every idea of imagination represents a truly vast amount of what is or has been the case. This chapter examines the roles of confusion and causation in Spinoza’s theory of imaginative representation. In doing so, it uncovers a promising way in which he could use his distinctive conatus doctrine—that “each thing, insofar as it is in itself, strives to persevere in its being” (Ethics 3p6)—both to constrain the otherwise vast extent of the imaginative representation of what is and to explain how imaginative misrepresentation is possible."
10.17509/ijal.v8i2.13312,Teaching philosophy in practice: Developing compatibility through personal practical knowledge,"As part of an MATESOL mentoring program, developing educators were paired with experienced professors.  The authors explore how personal practical knowledge bridges the gap between teaching philosophy and classroom practice. The complex layers of experience and knowledge that a mentor can offer need to be prompted, however; they cannot simply be deduced by observing. Using observational notes, interviews, and reflection, we explore real-time teaching decisions as a way to elaborate and reconsider the usually succinct teaching philosophy statement. This is particularly important for new teachers and those who are teaching in contexts or with students whose culture is still being absorbed. Personal practice knowledge is seen as the stem from which both teaching philosophy and classroom practice bloom."

Most of the material that has been published to date under the rubric of African philosophy has been methodological in character. One reason for this is the conflicts that sometimes arise when philosophers in Africa attempt to reconcile their relationships with both academic philosophy and so-called African '‘traditional’ systems of thought. A further complication is that the studies of traditional African thought systems that become involved in these conflicts are themselves products of academia– of disciplinary methodologies."
10.1515/mjss-2017-0035,The Role of Philosophy in Enhancing the Quality of Human Resource in Indonesia,"Abstract
The main purpose of philosophy is to describe how people may live and grow in better ways (Husserl, E.)1. The facts have shown that, once philosophy is involved, the character of people is thereby developed, leading them to have a better life. It is not only important for people to know about philosophy, but it must go beyond that point and be deeply understood, internalised, and practiced frequently. This paper will discuss the role of philosophy in order to show how the quality of human resource may be enhanced, in particular in Indonesia, in short-and long-term plans. The role of philosophy will determine whether the ultimate goal of understanding philosophy – which is to stimulate people to have critical, logical, comprehensive, and in-depth ways of thinking in their own field of expertise, which enables them to solve problems raised and faced in life – is going to be achieved in improving the quality of human resource in Indonesia. In addition to that, the educational sector should also be taking part in reaching this goal. People as individuals, who possess a good character and are always thinking philosophically and practicing the concept of philosophy in their daily lives, will achieve an exceptional life that is not only responsible and beneficial to themselves but also to their environment, surroundings, and communities."

The paper is devoted to the philosophical and theological as well as mathematical ideas of Nicholas of Cusa (1401–1464). He was a mathematician, but first of all a theologian. Connections between theology and philosophy on the one side and mathematics on the other were, for him, bilateral. In this paper we shall concentrate only on one side and try to show how some theological ideas were used by him to answer fundamental questions in the philosophy of mathematics."
10.2478/scs-2014-0173,Evaluation of Tanzania Curriculum: An Analysis Using Ornstein's View on Educational Philosophy,"Abstract
It is arguably clear that regardless of one's philosophical orientation, sometimes change cannot be avoided. On the same vein, the change of curriculum in educational sector has become irresistible almost everywhere. The aim of the paper has been to critique Tanzania Educational Philosophy using Ornstein's view (Ornstein, Pajak and Ornstein (2011:1-9); the choice of this work is based on credibility in curriculum studies. The findings indicate that curriculum change can never be avoided. The paper also focused on how traditional curriculum has not only changed, but also co-exists with contemporary curriculum. It has also been made evident that the curriculum in Tanzania has a lot of ‘patches’, and this may have given room for the recent massive Form Four failures. It is also true that recurrent threats to strike and even the last year strike by teachers are indicators that the curriculum needs thorough review. The paper further recommends the work of curriculum review should be not the sole responsibility of Tanzania Institute of Education (TIE) but all stakeholders. The process of curriculum review should receive almost an equal emphasis as the constitutional review."

10.1515/slgr-2016-0069,Language Acquisition in the Light of Rationalist Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Language,"Abstract
				 The present study deals with the problem of the acquisition of language in children in the light of rationalist philosophy of mind and philosophy of language. The main objective of the paper is to present the way Gerauld de Cordemoy’s views on the nature of language, including its socio-linguistic aspects, and on the process of speech acquisition in children are reflected in contemporary writings on how people communicate with each other. Reflections on 17th-century rationalist philosophy of mind and the latest research conducted within the field of cognitive abilities of human beings indicate that between those two spheres many similarities could be discerned in terms of particular stages of the development of speech and its physical aspects."
10.1515/slgr-2016-0003,Theological Underpinnings of the Modern Philosophy of Mathematics.,"Abstract
The study is focused on the relation between theology and mathematics in the situation of increasing secularization. My main concern is nineteenth-century mathematics. Theology was present in modern mathematics not through its objects or methods, but mainly through popular philosophy, which absolutized mathematics. Moreover, modern pure mathematics was treated as a sort of quasi-theology; a long-standing alliance between theology and mathematics made it habitual to view mathematics as a divine knowledge, so when theology was discarded, mathematics naturally took its place at the top of the system of knowledge. It was that cultural expectation aimed at mathematics that was substantially responsible for a great resonance made by set-theoretic paradoxes, and, finally, the whole picture of modern mathematics."
10.1093/oso/9780198738909.001.0001,Renewing Philosophy of Religion,"This book presents the sometimes unique, occasionally overlapping, and often mutually reinforcing views of fourteen contemporary philosophers of religion on what is wrong with the status quo in philosophy of religion and, most importantly, how the field could be improved. The book falls into two parts. The chapters in Part 1 are about desirable changes to the focus of the field; those in Part 2 are about the standpoint from which philosophers of religion should approach their field. More specifically, the chapters in Part 1 consider how an emphasis on faith distorts attempts to engage non-Western religious ideas; how philosophers from different traditions might collaborate on common interests; why the common presupposition of ultimacy leads to error; how new religious movements feed a naturalistic philosophy of religion; why a focus on belief and a focus on practice are both mistaken; why philosophy’s deep axiological concern should set much of the field’s agenda; and how the field might contribute to religious evolution. Part 2 includes a qualitative analysis of the standpoint of fifty-one philosophers of religion and also addresses issues about the need for humility in continental philosophy of religion; the implausibility of claiming that one’s own worldview is uniquely rational; the Moorean approach to religious epistemology; a Spinozan middle way between “insider” and “outsider” perspectives; and the unorthodox lessons we could learn from scriptures like the Book of Job if we could get past the confessional turn in recent philosophy of religion."

This article begins the cycle of portraits of the members of the Editorial Board and Editorial Advisory Board of the journal Physical Culture and Sport. Studies and Research, who are eminent social scientists researching the issue of sport. Among them, there are many world-class professors, rectors and deans of excellent universities, founders, presidents and secretaries-general of continental and international scientific societies and editors of high-scoring journals related to social sciences focusing on sport. The journal Physical Culture and Sport. Studies and Research started its activities in 2008 and gathered many readers, distinguished authors and outstanding reviewers. It is worth taking a moment to present the profiles of the individual editors, thanks to whom the journal keeps getting better and better. The journal is increasingly appreciated internationally particular among the scientists from the humanist and social areas of investigations. The rapidly increasing number of its readers and its surprisingly wide reception, indicated by the number of visits and downloads in English-speaking countries, including hundreds of universities (up to 791 were interested in the content of issue 62 of our magazine), research institutes and related libraries, as well as academics, researchers and students, should be celebrated. These data are derived only from one bibliographic data base (EBSCO). It must be noted that the journal is indexed in 43 bases.
Portraits presenting the journal’s editors include, among others, their most important professional, organizational and scientific achievements. Each subsequent issue of PCSSR will include one such portrait. We shall begin with the portrait of Professor Jerzy Kosiewicz, Ph.D., who is the Editor-in-Chief of the journal."
10.1515/spes-2016-0006,Original research article. Values of a Sign in the Theory and Philosophy of Physical Culture in Matić Work,"Summary
				 The 80th anniversary of the birth of dr Milivoje Matić is a trigger for a reassessment of his contribution to physical culture. By individually analysing Matić’s contributions in each of his works between 1961 and 1998, we come to the conclusion that in some of his publications exist sparks of “philosophical fragments”, which are necessary for comprehending the author’s belief that Matić has made it possible to discuss a possibility of a philosophical aspect and a constitution of the philosophy of physical culture in our country. M. Matić gives pointers which signify an event which would be prognostic on a permanent progress in our profession, in the context of education as a whole, domestically and abroad.
				In this discussion, the topic of Matić’s contribution to the analysis of physical education in the philosophy of physical culture, and in the context of the sign of direction in the domestic education reform, the domestic physical education reform should be observed and analysed from the aspect of transversal connections which repeatedly link deliberation of the theory and practice of physical education."
10.1515/ausfm-2016-0014,"Paul Leni’s Waxworks: Writing Images from Silence, through Media and Philosophy","Abstract
The so-called German Weimar Cinema encompasses a profusion of films that used frame narratives. In the case of Paul Leni’s Waxworks (Das Wachsfigurenkabinett, 1924), as the framing stems from a literary act (the stories are framed by the act of narration), the film proposes the mise-en-abyme technique as a sort of immersion into the intermedial when it deals with notions like speaking, writing, silence, image and cinema. In the case of silent cinema, and especially in Waxworks, the presence of a perverse relation with the medium of writing becomes noticeable (producing a fantasy of writing), since every effort to represent the literary act on film results in an infinite production of silent images, creating a parody effect and even postulating an act of aggression against writing. This confrontational relation between the writing code and the code of the mute image in silent cinema allows us to suggest that there is an inherent inflexibility in the language of silent cinema which does not allow the coexistence of written and spoken word as complementary codes. On the contrary, in silent cinema, the image and the silence of the film seem to work against the word, the spoken word being set forth against silence, and the written word against images."
10.1515/ptse-2016-0013,The New Responsibility and Challenge of Education: The Current and Prospective Situation of Philosophy for Children,"Abstract
				 Douglas Martin (an editor) wrote a memoir in New York Times about Matthew Lipman, the founder of philosophy for children, today’s classic thinker. Lipman’s death brought attention again for the philosophy for children’s status among professionals. Later one of the most prestigious international educational periodical review, the Journal of Philosophy of Education published a special edition - on account of Lipman’s death - about the analysis of present and future problems of philosophy for children. Paul Standish, the editor in chief, enhances Lipman’s thought in the Introduction, if the ability to think critically was not established in childhood: it would be unlikely later to flourish. Hence, he hit upon the idea of teaching philosophy to children, and the course that he developed spread, in its original or derivative forms, to more than 4,000 schools in the United States and more than sixty foreign countries, its materials translated into forty languages. The question has to be answered: where is the real place, value, function - within philosophy? What is philosophy for children’s “differentia specifica”? How to make the application of philosophy for children more effective and more convincing in both research and education?"
10.1515/manment-2017-0001,Changing the philosophy of organization management in the times of e-economy,"Summary
The paper highlights the fundamental changes in the way of thinking in science and the management practice caused by the transition from the era of industrial civilization to the information civilization. These include the change in the subject of management, i.e. the transition from the management of the organization to the management of joint projects; from the requirement of flexibility from own resources to the ability to use external resources and the departure from the methodological rationality of a decision to the material rationality.
The change of management philosophy is particularly evident in the electronic market which sets a new and interesting research area, due to its cognitive appeal resulting from different conditions in comparison to the traditional market, and due to the high dynamics of development.
The article is theoretical and its purpose is cognitive. Its subject is a fragment of the author’s concept of the evolution of management in the organizational space. It presents the synthesis of observations on the transformations of the essence of management. To undertake such a research task is motivated by the argument that one of the tasks of management science is to visualize the changes that take place within it, in order to induce the revision of anchored old cognitive patterns inadequate to reality and replace them with new, described by an appropriate conceptual apparatus."
10.2478/v10141-010-0002-4,Deconstructing Sport: When Philosophy and Education Meet in Derrida's Thought,"Deconstructing Sport: When Philosophy and Education Meet in Derrida's Thought
        Jacques Derrida (1930-2004), master of the deconstructionist method and recognized as one of the greatest thinkers of our time, was in his youth, before beginning his career as a philosopher, a footballer who played this game with the Italian prisoners in Algiers, his birthplace, during World War II. In a 1991 interview, when he was 60, Derrida narrated in detail his childhood dream of becoming a professional football player, confiding that all of his philosophy and thought had been inspired by sport and the game of football. Starting from this biographical note, the aim of my study is to demonstrate, first of all, how Derrida's whole philosophy and technique of deconstruction really has its roots in the concept of sport. The French-Algerian philosopher understood sport as a cultural structure based on the concepts of play, game, body, rules, and all of the oppositional pairs deriving from différance and from the tensions it generates. Secondly, the study tries to show how sport is for Derrida a metaphor of life and its meaning, suspended between being and nothingness; a place and a field in which human beings act, learn and educate themselves, deconstructing, as in a text, the values and prejudices of their lives and understanding, through sport itself, their roles and responsibility toward themselves and the community in which they live."

The study is focused on the relation between theology and mathematics in the situation of increasing secularization. My main concern in the second part of this paper is the early-twentieth-century foundational crisis of mathematics. The hypothesis that pure mathematics partially fulfilled the functions of theology at that time is tested on the views of the leading figures of the three main foundationalist programs: Russell, Hilbert and Brouwer."
10.2478/v10237-011-0043-6,Professional Philosophy: Inside the Delivery of Sport Psychology Service at Team Denmark,"Professional Philosophy: Inside the Delivery of Sport Psychology Service at Team Denmark
        The field of applied psychology has developed rapidly in Europe in the past four decades. In Denmark, the sports psychology profession has been characterized by a diversity of approaches with little overarching consensus on the professional philosophy and interventions strategies among consultants in the field. In 2008, Team Denmark established a sport psychology team with the aim to enhance the quality and consistency of applied sport psychology services. The team began their work by creating a professional philosophy. This paper describes the rationale, content, and implications of this philosophy, including: (a) basic beliefs and values; (b) theories of intervention and behaviour change; (c) objectives of the sport psychology intervention, (d) the content and focus of the interventions, and (e) sport psychological services and methods. High quality service requires coherence across all five levels of the philosophy. Implications of introducing the professional philosophy include a more unified service delivery across Denmark and the fact that sport psychology services are demanded more than ever in Danish elite sport."
10.2478/hssr-2013-0027,"IDEAS in AGORA: The Philosophy of the Empires, Fear and Sense of Exemplarity","Abstract
				 Why do the United States reserve the right to be called “America” by conferring the “Americas” to the whole continent?, is that a clear sign of discrimination or supremacy or both? Ideologically, America refers to the United States of “America” excluding other regions such as Latin America, central or South America. This leads some scholars to explain convincingly that, beyond this subtle grammatical difference, the Anglo-ethnocentrism in the United States has been drawn to make their citizens believe they are unique, outstanding, and special. Basically, this belief allowed not only to fight against the political enemies in Europe or in any other geographical point, but also to control the incipient worker union leaderships. What merits further attention, anyway, is the sentiment of exemplarity instilled by the founding parents of this nation. Fear was historically a mechanism of control employed by US governments at different stages in several ways. Our intention is not only to review how the fear disciplined by the claims of work-force, but also explain why the sentiment of exemplarity and fear are inextricably intertwined."

10.1515/sh-2015-0017,Rhetoric Tradition and Democracy: Isocrates’ Role in Ancient Greek Political Idea. Start Point of Western Political Philosophy,"Abstract
Political participation and the public education that have always been deployed to support the incipient progress of the civic life are revived in the modern political discourses. It has been believed that the age of pre-Socrates was the age of the Sophists whose acrid fallacy works occupied the political sphere, a malaise in government. However, speaking non-traditionally in the modern pedagogical system, there were some pre-Socratic thinkers and political philosophers/orators who’s works are the backbone of modern discourse on this matter. It will be examined whether any part of the classical rhetoric apparatus can be recovered and put to a good practice in the modern education and modern political participation. This point will be illustrated, furthermore, in this paper by alleging the importance of rhetoric, its role in Ancient Greek Democracy, and its influence on the modern concepts of power and democracy, as a continual element in a historical-political life. The further consideration is whether there was any democratic Polis existed in Ancient Athens and then, if there was, what characteristics it consisted of. Moreover, whether such concept can or should be considered in modern political discourses. In this sense, the liberal, non-dogmatic strain of the sophistry of Isocrates tradition urges us to indicate that the findings of this educational principles are, if not necessary, but adjutant complementary metes to our modern political knowledge of the states. In the end, it is inquired to see comparatively that how the tradition of rhetorical art and the concept of power in the Ancient Greek society have pertained to the modern democratic elements and whether we are able to empower this influential element in modern states."
10.1515/pjap-2015-0042,The role of the happiness philosophy and core self-evaluations in defining job satisfaction as seen by the self and the significant other,"Abstract
Our paper analyses sources of job satisfaction. A cross-sectional study in two variants: an online questionnaire (n=642) and its paper version (n=635), were used to measure the impact of core self-evaluations, hedonism and eudaimonism on job satisfaction. To strengthen the dependent variable (job satisfaction) measurement, two sources for this data were used: the target person’s self-assessment and his or her significant other’s evaluation. The results show that the significant other’s assessment can be a valuable source of information on the target person’s job satisfaction. On top of that, hierarchical regression has shown that both happiness philosophies: eudaimonism and hedonism have predictive power over the assessment of job satisfaction based on core self-evaluations."
10.1515/clear-2016-0012,Popularization and/or Trivialization of Philosophy in Voltaire's Narrative Candide or Optimism,"Abstract
Voltaire produced his works within the literary-historical period of Classicism and Enlightenment, in which the prevalent role of literature was educational. The period also dictated what genre, theme, style and structure authors should follow. However, more and more changes of literary genres appear, and the process of stratification of literature into high and trivial takes place. The aim of this paper is to describe the polarization of two mutually different processes involved in the literary shaping of Voltaire's philosophical narrative Candide or Optimism. In Voltaire's narrative, the popularization of philosophy, in order to simplify and illuminate the philosophical writings of G. W. Leibniz, results in the changes of style and content that become understandable to the general readership since they work within the scheme of an adventure novel. In this process, trivialization does not affect only the genre, but is also present in other parts of literary analysis and interpretation such as the theme, motifs, structure, characterization, narrative techniques, stylistic features, and so on."
10.1515/jesr-2017-0003,The Views of Nature of Science Expressed by In-Service Teachers Who were Learning History and Philosophy of Science,"Abstract
Science teachers need an adequate understanding of the nature and processes of science as the basis for their pedagogical content knowledge for effective classroom delivery. The aim of the study was to find out in-service teachers’ views on the nature of science (NOS) and how their views compared with informed understanding of the NOS. The study adopted an exploratory case study methodology, qualitative in nature, and used convenience sampling. A questionnaire was administered to 50 in-service teachers doing a bachelor of science honours degree at a selected university in Zimbabwe. The students had done a course in history and philosophy of science where there were exposed to some topics on the NOS. Frequency counts and mean scores were used to describe views of the participants. Analysis involved comparing in-service teachers’ responses with experts’ views. The findings reveal that the students had a naïve understanding of NOS in 5 out of 16 statements from the administered questionnaire. Despite these observations the participants generally had a fair understanding of the NOS as evidenced by the fact that the participants managed to correctly respond to 69% of the questions asked. As such we infer that teaching and learning of nature of science as part of history and philosophy of science had a positive impact on in-service teachers’ views. The few instances when participants’ responses revealed contradictions, suggest that teaching and learning history and philosophy of science may not be adequate to develop a full understanding of nature of science. Further research is recommended with large samples, using a revised Views Of Nature of Science (VNOS) questionnaire and interviews, and document analysis to reveal how nature of science is taught and learnt."

10.1515/jec-2017-0004,Philosophy of the Profession and Professional Knowledge in the Structure of Professional Identity of Hei Teachers in Riga and Smolensk,"Abstract
				Teacher is a key figure in the implementation of reforms in higher education. Pedagogical research of the professional identity (PI) of teacher, her/his priority values, self-evaluation of performances and professional knowledge and the way how she/he conceptualises the profession at an individual level can lead to the most appropriate strategies to manage the educational reforms successfully. This article presents some results of the Latvian-Russian project ‘Professional Identity of Contemporary Pedagogue’ implemented in 2014-2016 by researchers of Riga (Latvia) and Smolensk (Russia). In the realisation of project, a hypothetical model of the content of Higher Education Institution (HEI) teacher’s PI was created, and HEI teachers’ survey was carried out. In total, 198 teachers were surveyed in Riga and Smolensk. The aim of this article is to examine the relevance of the proposed model and analyse the indicators of the first two components of the model: Philosophy of the Profession and Professional Knowledge. The results show that, on the whole, the answers of the Russian and Latvian teachers in the questionnaire are fairly well agreed; however, some differences and peculiarities in the data of Riga and Smolensk were observed. The relevance of the proposed model has been confirmed, and some problems of PI of HEI teachers have been identified. To improve the educational process, executives of the reform and teachers should pay due attention to these problems."

10.1515/jles-2017-0018,"The unborn child: history, philosophy and religion","Abstract
All throughout history the unborn, and implicitly its protection, have been subject for academics and practitioners of various areas. The problem of the origin of the soul and the exact determination of the moment when it is united with the body was crucial in enabling us to define the exact moment when the human life begins, and, consequently, for providing proper protection for the unborn child. In this context visions of the Greek philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, and of the Latin writer Tertullian, as well as Christian perspectives were analysed in order to identify the starting point of the human being to help determine the level of protection provided for the unborn in history. Finally, considering the fact that not even today has consensus been achieved concerning the beginning of human life, it was and still is difficult to provide proper legal protection for the unborn child, but in our opinion this is by far not impossible."
10.1515/ijtr-2015-0011,Exploring Community Philosophy as a tool for parental engagement in a primary school,"Abstract
				 In this paper, I will reflect on the initial reconnaissance, action, and reflection cycle of my doctoral research, exploring Community Philosophy as a tool for critical parental engagement in a primary school (Elliot, 1991). I will examine how I reflexively engaged with my influence on participants, which then significantly influenced the framing of, and the planning for, the second action research cycle. 
				The challenges that the initial stages of my research have presented will be considered using Herr and Anderson’s five components of validity (Herr and Anderson, 2014). I then use the four Chronotopes of Research developed by Kamberelis and Dimitriadis (2005) to discuss the implications for my understanding of positioning, authenticity and transformation, and the resultant reframing of my research. 
				In order to set the context for my research, I begin by giving a brief overview of my own interest in ‘democratic voice’. This is followed by an exploration of the current ‘closing the gap’ discourse in English education (OFSTED, 2013; Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, 2014; Wilshaw, 2013), to demonstrate how parental engagement has become individualised, lacks democratic voice, and often valorises middle class parents. Hence I will argue that there is a need for a more democratic and collective model of parental engagement, and make a case for justifying Community Philosophy as a possible model."

The paper focuses on some important philosophical issues of Kant’s philosophical legacy, especially on Kant’s thoughts on man and his acting in community with other human beings, his fellows, (Conjectural Beginning of Human History) from the aspect of morality based on moral-practical terms and categories. The field of Kant’s practical-critical thoughts is not only unusually broad but also full of ideological dynamics offered in a precise and modern linguistic form. The paper claims that Kant offers his own answer for the fourth question “Was ist der Mensch” (“What is man?”), introduced in Logic (Kant, 1992, p. 538) and at the same it also introduces a historical dimension to the issue of man, included in his short writings, in a compact form."
10.1515/sh-2016-0011,Emotions in Philosophy. A Short Introduction,"Abstract
				 In recent decades, there has been a renewed attention to the emotions amongst scientists of different disciplines: psychology, psychiatry, neurobiology, cognitive science, computer science, sociology, economics, and many others. There are many research centers and scientific journals devoted to affective states already existing. However, studies of emotion have a very long history - especially in philosophy (anthropology, ethics, aesthetics, epistemology, and rhetoric). Philosophers first raised many important questions about emotions and their contribution to the discovery of the nature of emotions is very important. The aim of the article is the reconstruction of the views on emotions of particular thinkers in history of philosophy."

The aim of this study is to reflect upon the main issues of the so-called philosophy of sport education, showing its methodologies and possible use in the context of sport studies. This study will begin answering two of the main questions dealing with the issues of the philosophy of sport education, that is: what are sport and its values from an educational philosophical perspective and how can we put these values into practice through a practical methodology?
The study will show that the philosophy of sport education is a human science capable of developing both a theoretical and practical knowledge very useful for physical education teachers, sport educators, athletes, and coaches. The aim of this philosophical science is to analyze and understand sport in order to give it an educational and hermeneutical sense: that is, interpreting and not merely describing sport and its complex problems, and trying to find a solution in light of a pedagogical perspective and through a reflexive methodology of intervention."
10.1515/bsmr-2015-0005,"Politics of Imperceptibility: Philosophy, Post-Feminism and New Media Arts","Abstract
				 The essay discusses Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of becoming-imperceptible and raises the question to what extent it can be interpreted in terms of feminist politics and seen as a specific strategy for new media arts. Although the notion of becoming-imperceptible was condemned by second wave feminists, recent post-feminists representing the third wave argue not for politics of visibility but for politics of invisibility. Examining the practices of Lithuanian feminist media artists, the essay argues that becoming-imperceptible in new media arts means not an escape from visibility or a drive toward annihilation but a new conceptual strategy: becoming-imperceptible creates the potential for social and political change. This new conceptual strategy can be related to the new quality of the image: in this regard there is a close affinity between Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of becoming-imperceptible and the notion of the crystalline image which appears in Deleuze’s film theory: both notions engender duration, temporality and qualitative change. Therefore the essay claims that the crystalline image does not represent the world but recreates this world through multiple, changing and virtual images."
10.1515/eje-2017-0005,To what degree are philosophy and the ecological niche concept necessary in the ecological theory and conservation?,"Abstract
				 Ecology as a field produces philosophical anxiety, largely because it differs in scientific structure from classical physics. The hypothetical deductive models of classical physics are simple and predictive; general ecological models are predictably limited, as they refer to complex, multi-causal processes. Inattention to the conceptual structure of ecology usually imposes difficulties for the application of ecological models. Imprecise descriptions of ecological niche have obstructed the development of collective definitions, causing confusion in the literature and complicating communication between theoretical ecologists, conservationists and decision and policy-makers. Intense, unprecedented erosion of biodiversity is typical of the Anthropocene, and knowledge of ecology may provide solutions to lessen the intensification of species losses. Concerned philosophers and ecologists have characterised ecological niche theory as less useful in practice; however, some theorists maintain that is has relevant applications for conservation. Species niche modelling, for instance, has gained traction in the literature; however, there are few examples of its successful application. Philosophical analysis of the structure, precision and constraints upon the definition of a ‘niche’ may minimise the anxiety surrounding ecology, potentially facilitating communication between policy-makers and scientists within the various ecological subcultures. The results may enhance the success of conservation applications at both small and large scales."
10.1515/pcssr-2017-0012,A Pioneer of Italian Sports Pedagogy and Philosophy,"Abstract
The biography we present here in this issue of our journal refers to the story of Italian scholar, educationist, and philosopher, Emanuele Isidori, Vice-Rector for International Relations and Cooperation and head of the Laboratory of General and Sport Pedagogy of the Foro Italico University of Rome in Italy. The biography of Emanuele tells us the story of a pioneer both in sports pedagogy and sports philosophy in his home country of Italy, where the idealist tradition and some prejudices regarding sport and its science seem to have hindered the development process of the two subjects for many years. What emerges from this story is the commitment and strenuous effort of the scholar to develop sports humanities in his country and to help his university and other Italian researchers interested in the scholarly field develop their knowledge through collaboration with the most prestigious European institutions devoted to the study of sport and physical activity."

				 The first part of the study debates the role and the status of philosophy in the Hungarian culture in Transylvania, trying to explain why philosophy has not become an organic part of the Transylvanian culture as a whole. There are presented a few experimental and theoretical arguments, especially the theory of the so-called ‘short philosophical tradition’. The second part the paper seeks to analyse the impact of the ‘short philosophical tradition’ on the current philosophy life in Transylvania, bringing an overview of the institutional structure of Hungarian philosophy in Transylvania."
10.1515/ebce-2017-0006,Philosophy as the Wisdom of Love,"Abstract
The author argues that love should play a central role in philosophy (and ethics). In the past, philosophical practice has been too narrowly defined by theory and explanation. Although unquestionably important, they do not belong to the very core of our philosophizing. Philosophy is primarily a way of life, centered on the soul and the development of our humanity – in its most diverse aspects and to its utmost potential. For such a life to be possible, love must play a central role in philosophy and philosophy should be understood not in the traditional sense as “the love of wisdom,” but in a new way – as the wisdom of love."

        When we look at the very origins of human world, civilization in its history and prehistory, we can trace strong evidence of the archaic presence of leisure in human life. It seems striking and meaningful that in fact all that is human streams out from leisure. Leisure occurs to be an arch-human phenomenon. This paper addresses this multidimensional cultural presence and the sense and value of leisure conceived as a source of civilization, symbolic thought, social institutions, habits and practices. The cultural primordiality of leisure is evident when we take into consideration an aboriginal release from total preoccupation with only impulsive and instinctual survival activities that took place in the era of Homo habilis some 2 millions years ago. It is obvious that free time was a great achievement of these evolutionary forms of human beings when we reflect upon the earliest seeds of consciousness expressed in primitive pebble tools. These tools tell us about at least three important messages from our prehistory: that first man must have had some free time to think about given life-troubles and inventing implements; that primitive tools must have been a real help and means for hastening and unburdening a load of work and must have given in effect a small amount of discretionary time to avoid impulsive activity; and last, that primitive tools afterwards became the first material for imaginative aesthetic transformation and gave the first impulse for art. So art was the earliest non-compulsory and non-functional field of free activity and a borderline between the biological and cultural existence of infra-human and human species, the former centered completely and instinctively on just remaining alive and the latter disclosing outdistanced, free and reflective behavior. The next evolutionary steps in development of using free time were religion and philosophy. In religious acts with their ritual practices human beings made holy days of their holidays. Philosophical contemplation gave broad space for autonomous and autotelic thinking and self-fulfilling practices focused on human intellectual and moral self-realization (semi-divine activity and happiness). But the most modern acceleration of exercising leisure is recreation understood as a differential area of physical culture, tourism, play and rest. Leisure occurs to be not only free time after obligatory activities bound up with biological determinants of life and with work are completed, it is also an important social factor (for instance, for the stratification of the levels or classes of society), an existential state of being, a phenomenon of rejuvenation, enjoyment, pastime, pleasure, distraction, indolence, idleness. Leisure appears at last a great challenge for humans to show their own specific and private attitude towards their lives and understanding their own position in the whole world. The authentic leisure is not void time, it is overfilled with creative acts confirming human freedom and capacity for transgressionvirtue, here and now, sentiments"
10.2478/pcssr-2013-0017,Sport and Philosophy of Hospitality: Three Questions on How to Rethink Contemporary Sport Education in Light of Gift and Peace,"Abstract
				 The ancient Olympic Games were held in spaces and places consecrated for hospitality, to xénia, a Greek word that means “gifts” but also something that refers to and belongs to strangers and foreigners. Foreigners from every part of Greece met in Olympia to celebrate the agón. In this place, a stranger or a foreigner (hostis in Latin), probably a former enemy, became a friend because he was both guest and host (hospes in Latin) in the sanctuary-town, which belonged to the gods and to all of the Greeks, who recognized themselves in its spirit. This mechanism of hospitality formed the basis of the Olympic peace system and was the fundamental prerequisite for the celebration of agón. The practice of the agón was therefore made possible by a “gift” but also by “for-giveness” that allowed people to meet and compete. We can conclude that at the base of the Olympic (and Greek) ethics there was the concept of hospitality. Olympia was then the common home of all Greeks, the place where ethics were carried out, were put into practice, and concretely exercised. It is not a pure coincidence that the Greek word “ethics” is linked to the word éthos, which means “house”, “home”. For this reason, ethics can be thought as the art of hosting somebody in our own home and trusting him/her, just as it happened in ancient Olympia during the Olympic Games, which demonstrated that ethics was always a home’s ethics. Therefore, taking into account this cultural and philosophical framework, this study will develop a methodological approach, derived from deconstructionism, which will be applied to concepts that are both ambiguous and semantically rich in meaning, such as “gift”, “forgiveness”, xénos, hostis, and hospes. The first objective of this study is to reflect upon the connection between “gift” and “sport” and show the deep interconnection between the two concepts. The second is to use the model of Greek hospitality at the Olympic Games to deeply rethink sport and contemporary philosophy of sport education in terms of peace and multiculturalism."

10.5871/bacad/9780197265499.001.0001,Continuity and Innovation in Medieval and Modern Philosophy,"The usual division of philosophy into ‘medieval’ and ‘modern’ obscures the continuities in philosophy up until 1700. This book examines three areas where these continuities are particularly clear: knowledge, the mind, and language. It does so through three chapters, by different authors, each followed by a detailed response. The first chapter shows how Descartes attacked faculty psychology and thus separated himself from one strand of the medieval tradition, represented by Suárez. At the same time, Descartes was closely following another strand, found in Ockham. Thus, the discontinuity between medieval and modern may not be as sharp as first appears. The second chapter considers discussions of whether knowledge should be kept for the elite. In the Christian world medieval and seventeenth-century thinkers alike rarely advocated esotericism, but Jewish and Muslim scholars such as al-Ghazâlî, Averroes, and Maimonides strongly defended it. The main chapter of Part III argues that a version of such esotericism may be a defensible philosophical position today. The main chapter of Part II shows how Locke's philosophy of language fits into a long medieval tradition of thought based on Aristotle's On Interpretation. Locke introduced the requirement that a word be linked to an idea in the speaker's mind, but the chapter argues that this does not mean that Locke was proposing that we each have a private language."

It argues that Descartes’ philosophy is deeply imbued with ancient and medieval views of humanity’s place in the divine order, and yet is also the harbinger of a modern conception of a value-neutral and impersonal natural universe. It considers the tension between Descartes’ natural philosophy and account of physical law and suggests that these two mindsets represent a certain opposition within people’s thinking that still needs a resolution."
10.5871/bacad/9780197264201.001.0001,"Rationalism, Platonism and God","This book comprises three main chapters on Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, with extensive responses. It explores the common ground of the great early-modern rationalist theories, and provides an examination of the ways in which the mainstream Platonic tradition permeates these theories. One chapter identifies characteristically Platonic themes in Descartes’s cosmology and metaphysics, finding them associated with two distinct, even opposed attitudes to nature and the human condition, one ancient and ‘contemplative’, the other modern and ‘controlling’. It finds the same tension in Descartes’s moral theory, and believes that it remains unresolved in present-day ethics. Was Spinoza a Neoplatonist theist, critical Cartesian, or naturalistic materialist? The second chapter argues that he was all of these. Analysis of his system reveals how Spinoza employed Neoplatonist monism against Descartes’s Platonist pluralism. Yet the terminology — like the physics — is Cartesian. And within this Platonic-Cartesian shell Spinoza developed a rigorously naturalistic metaphysics and even, Ayers claims, an effectually empiricist epistemology. The final chapter focuses on the Rationalists’ arguments for the Platonist, anti-Empiricist principle of ‘the priority of the perfect’, i.e. the principle that finite attributes are to be understood through corresponding perfections of God, rather than the reverse. It finds the given arguments unsatisfactory but stimulating, and offers a development of one of Leibniz’s for consideration. These chapters receive informed and constructive criticism and development at the hands of, respectively, Douglas Hedley, Sarah Hutton and Maria Rosa Antognazza."
10.5871/bacad/9780197263464.003.0003,Can There be a Literary Philosophy of Time?,"This chapter takes the discussion of the metaphysics of time in a different direction. It asks whether the treatment of time in fictional narratives can teach anything about the nature of time, or the concepts and experience of it. In particular, it asks whether it can teach lessons that people cannot get from the usual philosophical studies of time. To pursue this question, the discussion assesses two main lines of thought that suggest the answer ‘Yes’. First, it focuses on such claims as that one can learn about time, and even about the self. Second, it considers the idea of appealing to a narrative with an unusual temporal structure, and to the ability to engage imaginatively with the narrative's time, to produce an argument that more usual structures are not necessary to time."

The influence of Immanuel Kant and David Hume on the discussion of theological and religious issues by philosophers is examined in the first section. The dual role of philosophy and the main forms of interaction between philosophy and theology are discussed in the next section. The chapter also examines three main themes: the nature and significance of religious experience, the attempts in the twentieth century to deal with some of the links between religion and reason, and the interaction between religious and moral beliefs."

However, English teachers are devoted to participating in these competitions but fail to put microlectures into practical teaching. Therefore, the focus of this paper is going to answer the following two questions, that is, how to make a good microlecture and how to use it properly. This paper chooses four videos from The Third China’s Microlectures Competition to analysis from three aspects: teaching philosophy, second language acquisition mechanism and education psychology. It is found that English teachers from senior high school generally do not understand the concept of microlectures. Generally speaking, teachers are intended to win the award of the competition but fail to put microlectures in the practical teaching. Teachers are inclined to select big topics, untypical teaching materials. What’s more, the structure of microlectures isn’t complete since some teachers ignore the exercise part. Based on these problems, on the one hand, English teachers should insist on life-long study and apply the latest education technologies into practical teaching. On the other hand, the organization of the whole microlecture should be developed logically. Suggestions are provided with teachers on how to make a make a good microlecture and how to use it properly."

According to the Socratic method, four main components underlie the process of therapy: systematic questioning, inductive reasoning, universal definitions, and a sincere disavowal of knowledge in the therapist and the client. These components work together to guide the dialogue that occurs in most therapy sessions. In addition, the Socratic method often focuses on two major topical areas: self-improvement and cultivating virtue in everyday life.

10.4028/www.scientific.net/amr.433-440.6315,Significance of Mathematization of Philosophical Problems from the Angle of Broadspectrum Philosophy,"Whether philosophy can realize mathematization has long been controversial. As the mathematics develops a nonquantative branch- structural mathematics, however, mathematization of philosophy has a turnaround. Broadspectrum philosophy which makes use of structural mathematics has established a generally applicable as well as precise mathematical model for many philosophical problems, giving a positive answer to whether the philosophy can be mathematized. Mathematizaiton of philosophy allows more accurate and clear distinction of people’s expression in meaning, gives ideas the visible characteristics, makes philosophy an analyzable discipline, and realizes routinization of philosophical methods. Hegel was well versed in mathematics but opposed “Extreme Mathematic Attitude”, since he thought recognizing all the objects from the mathematic standpoint of “Quantity or Quantitative Relationship” would ignore the qualitative difference among the objects.［1］P239 Hegel’s opinion was based on the traditional mathematic which takes the Quantitative Relationship as the foundation. Holding the same evidence as Hegel's, most philosophers nowadays still suspect that the philosophy can be mathematized. When the modern mathematics has developed a new nonquantative branch, the Structural Mathematics, the philosophy mathematization, however, meets a turning point. Opposed to Quantitative Mathematics, the Structural Mathematics focuses on research of mathematic relationship and structure on the basis of abstract set theory. Since the structural mathematics doesn't rely on quantity and quantitative relationship, it can be combined in research of philosophy which usually doesn’t possess quantitative characteristics. Establishment of Broadspectrum Philosophy is a successful attempt. With full application of set theory, symbolic logic, modern algebra, transformation group theory and graph theory, Broadspectrum Philosophy constructs a generally applicable as well as precise mathematical mode for many philosophical problems, bringing a fundamental change to the philosophy. This paper attempts to make some preliminary analysis on the significance of establishment of Broadspectrum Philosophy."

10.3846/cpc.2016.246,"Editorial. Dialogue, Communication and Collaboration: Aspects of Philosophy and Communication","Acting as a usual means of everyday communication and collaboration, dialogue is also a fundamental mode of human presence in the world. It is innate and, therefore, feels organic to people. Nothing but a dialogue determines and defines the inborn human potential of reflexivity, empathy and communitivity. Naturally, it is hardly surprising that as a phenomenon, a dialogue constantly fell within the purview of most prominent European thinkers and throughout different historical epochs, in the spaces of philosophy and communication, it unfolded in a diverse and multidimensional manner. Ancient Greek philosopher Plato wrote in the form of dialogue, this way opening the possibility to a reader to learn about the world and the order of things as well as defining a certain relationship between the perceiving subject and the perceivable object. In the early Middle Ages, writings of Saint Augustine encouraged people to immerse into themselves and start a conversation with God, which established a certain living relationship between spaces empirical and transcendental. Much later, towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, German phenomenologist Edmund Husserl, who developed the theory of the intentionality of the consciousness, perceived that no living relationship between people is feasible without intersubjectivity. In this case, the communication is conditioned on the focus of at least two subjects on a certain object. This object, in particular, ensures the potential of the meaning, content and the purpose of communication. Another German author Martin Buber treated the dialogue as a phenomenon, in which an individual establishes a personal relationship with the Christian God, and this gives rise to a certain immediacy: a confrontation with the Ruler of the Kingdom of Heaven gives meaning to all the other interpersonal relationships. These are but few different philosophical interpretations of dialogue as a phenomenon. The universe of issues related to dialogue emerges from thinking perspectives of philosophers as well as communication theorists. On the one hand, the perspective of communication trivializes the phenomenon of dialogue, depriving it of its depth and profoundness; and on the other hand, it defines and specifies the concept of dialogue, assigning to it a form or function. This issue of the journal is devoted to the analysis of the phenomenon of dialogue both in the fields of philosophy and communication, inquiring into different contexts of its development. In her article Communication Solutions by Improving Interactive Art Projects, Gintarė Vainalavičiūtė analyses the relationship between visual arts and contemporary technologies, which determines both the rise of the forms of dialogue and non-traditional understanding of works of art. Mindaugas Stoškus contributed an article entitled Disciplines of Political Philosophy and Political Science: Antagonism, Cooperation or Indifference? in which he investigates the relationship between these two disciplines, conditions and problems pertaining to their dialogue, and the particularly intensified dynamics of the dialogue in the fifties of the 20th century. In their article Online Artistic Activism: Case-Study of Hungarian-Romanian Intercultural Communication, Gizela Horváth and Rozália Klára Bakó delve into the interactive relationship between works of art and their perceiver, as these works of art send messages via the social media environment. Moral Perception, Cognition, and Dialogue is an article authored by Vojko Strahovnik, in which he examines the causes for the rise of cases that hinder intercommunication and mutual understanding, such as disagreement, intercultural dialogues, etc. Problems of visual communication and the specificity of visual languages, bringing together subjects into dialogue are discussed by Arto Mutanen in his article Relativity of Visual Communication. Another article entitled Scientific Realism versus Antirealism in Science Education is a contribution by Seungbae Park, in which he attempts to define how the dialogue between teachers and students is possible, as he takes the position stating that the doctrine of scientific realism is much more effective than provided opportunities of scientific antirealism. And finally, Algis Mickūnas, in his article The Different Other and Dialogue, discusses the reasons why members of different communities find it difficult to establish dialogue-based relationships and why in some cases they remain imprisoned in the state of a monologue. This issue of the journal presents a truly wide field of investigations into opportunities and obstacles for communication, interaction and collaboration. It is pleasing to see that representatives of various humanities and social sciences joined the same dialogue. Looking forward to the productive insights in the future, the Editor would like to express her gratitude to the authors of this issue."

There are explored philosophical ideas which influenced the emergence of political science, the process of its institutionalisation and the relation between political science and political philosophy. The analysis of the process of institutionalisation aims at identification of the main causes of the conflict between two disciplines. The culmination of that conflict occured at sixth decade of twentieth century and was named “The Behavioral Revolution”. The sharp antagonism lasted nearly two decates and when it came to an end the relation between political philosophy and political science became stable though ambiguous."

The city, the modern metropolis played a vital role in this transition from premodern world to modern era. The metamorphosis of archaic structures, including the fields of economy, society and thinking, are inevitably associated with tensions engendering aversion against the city. Anti-urbanism appeared sporadically everywhere, as a continuous tradition, it emerged at two remote corners of the world: in United States and Germany. Hungarian anti-urbanism of the interwar period had been motivated by the shock of the disintegration of the “Historical Greater Hungary”. The motif of guilty city emerged in the atmosphere of scapegoating: Budapest appeared as incompatible with Hungarian national character. These ruminations about the role of city were embedded in a special context mixing city-philosophy, cultural criticism, German-origin crisis philosophy, political philosophy and national characterology. It was a peculiar mixture in the Central European region: Hungarian interwar thought, from this respect, follows the regional patterns."
10.3846/cpc.2016.261,First Philosophy in the Border Zone,"The article will be devoted to such problems as a idea of subsidiarity, a cosmopolitan right and a visitor figure in context and interpretation of ancient and modern philosophy. The article deals with the concept of subsidiarity which is taken as a point of departure for the discipline of borderology, an academic study with Kantian roots. Borderology, according to the principle of subsidiarity, can present as a new field of investigation which invites philosophers and social scientists to replace a “top down” with a “bottom up” procedure. The figure of the visitor is close linked with the experience of subsidiarity which means the freedom and initiative below the level of State. In Immanuel Kant’s strategy for perpetual peace, the figure of the visitor launches a critique of a tendency to self-aggrandizement, characteristic of the modern State and thereby a defense of the political independence of local border regions. The visitor also invites us to see, think and work to liberate our own subjectivity from false voices of sovereignty. Kant articulates the offer of the visitor by bringing in the term Verkehr. Using Kant scholar Otfried Höffe,s methodology we show how idea of subsidiarity is overlooked in international political theory, explain some constitutive principles of borderology, from which is more important is the methodological principle of an intercultural discourse and presents borderology as an anti-Huntingtonian model for border studies."

By practicing this philosophy, it is expected that the citizens&amp;rsquo; quality of life and local environments could be sustainably improved. This study aims to explore the contribution of the community practices of the sufficiency economy philosophy to rural villagers&amp;rsquo; quality of life improvement, and to investigate potential factors that determine the trust of villagers in the philosophy. With the purpose to propose strategies which could enhance trust and promote villagers&amp;rsquo; practices of the philosophy, the study investigated influences of three relevant factors on trust towards the philosophy. Those factors included factors related to cognitive-based trust, factors related to emotional-based trust, and factors related to demographic characteristics. Questionnaire surveys and in-depth interviews with community leaders and local villagers were conducted in the Ban Jamrung community, in Thailand&amp;rsquo;s Rayong province. The results of the statistical analysis revealed that the residents who applied the sufficiency economy philosophy in their daily lives experienced a relatively better quality of life. Additionally, it was found that trust in the philosophy could be predicted more by rational factors than by emotional factors. These findings could be utilized to develop strategies to maintain and enhance the trust of the people in the philosophy of sufficiency economy."

Under the “ritual system” in Confucianism, the central axis of urban roads, spatial sequence of architecture, rigid urban layout reflected the rigid hierarchy and ethical order of the society. Taoist philosophy emphasized the harmony between humankind and nature, and highly valued the protection of ecological environment during the urban construction process. These traditional urban planning system and thought summarized the experience in urban planning and construction in ancient China. We should discard the dross and assimilate the fine essence, and develop the unique cultural characteristics of urban construction in China."
10.22439/fs.v25i2.5576,FREEDOM IN THE ARCHIVE:  On Doing Philosophy through Historiography,"It is argued in this article that Foucault’s most distinctive contribution to philosophical practice is to be found in his distinctive mode of taking up historiography, exploring critically the conditions and limits of knowledge through archival work. The focus on knowledge would seem to place him in the critical lineage of Kant; however, his appeal to history and archival explorations reconfigure the relation between sensibility and the understanding in a way that suggests a different concern with the conditions of “a possible knowledge.” After discussing how Foucault’s archival work engages a distinct sensibility, I suggest that his concern with knowledge can best be understood not within a transcendental project, however historicized, but within the logical space of Hegel’s Doctrine of the Concept, specifically the discussion of the Idea of cognition where it is a question of the twin processes of unifying subjectivity and objectivity as expressive of cognition’s “urge to truth.” Understood within this conceptual context, Foucault’s distinctive archival approach to what he calls “subjectivation” and “objectivation” allows us to appreciate the distinction between knowledge and truth in a way that leaves open the possibility of transformation."
10.22439/fs.v25i2.5573,Philosophical Practice as Self-modification:  An Essay on Michel Foucault’s  Critical Engagement with Philosophy,"This essay argues that what makes Michel Foucault’s oeuvre not only stand apart but also cohere is an assiduous philosophical practice taking the form of an ongoing yet concrete self-modification in the medium of thought. Part I gives an account of three essential aspects of Foucault’s conception of philosophical activity. Beginning with his famous characterization of philosophy in terms of ascēsis, it moves on to articulate his characterization of philosophical practice as a distinct form of meditation, differing from both Cartesian meditation and Hegelian meditation, as it aims to stand vigil for the day to come and operates as a preface to transgression. Part II begins the articulation of crucial traits left implicit in this understanding of philosophy by turning to Foucault’s in-depth investigation of philosophy in Antiquity during his lectures at the Collège de France in the 1980s. First, it develops how philosophy here begins to constitute and distinguish itself by establishing itself as an activity that has a privileged relationship to truth and truth-telling as an unremitting, existentially determining challenge for the philosopher. Further, it instantiates how Platonism elaborates the need for a sustained ‘auto-ascetic’ ethical non-compliant differentiation as the condition of possibility for accessing and stating truth, and then describes how the assertion of an ethical differentiation and attitude in Cynicism takes the form of an insistent combat for another world in this world. Finally, it underlines how the ethical-practical philosophical work upon oneself in Antiquity is developed in an ongoing critical and political exchange with others. Part III indicates how ethical differentiation according to Foucault remains an essential precondition for the practice of philosophy and is further developed in the modern age. This is particularly perspicuous in Kant’s determination of the Enlightenment, in the attitude of modernity exemplified by Baudelaire, and in the history of revolt since the beginning of early Modernity. On this background, Part IV develops how philosophy as an ongoing meditative practice of self-modification leads to an affirmative critique, confirming the virtuality of this world in order to investigate the potentiality in the examined. In this manner, the essay presents Foucault’s philosophical practice as well as an outline of the history of ideas of a seemingly alternate, yet still agenda-setting conception of philosophical practice today."
10.12697/spe.2015.8.2.10,"Theoretical Philosophy and Philosophy of Science in the Soviet Times:  Some Remarks on the Example of Estonia, 1960-1990","This part of the Soviet philosophy that corresponds approximately to theoretical philosophy and philosophy of science on the example of Estonia and proceeding from the University of Tartu is discussed. The author concentrates on the period of approximately 1960–1990, when he himself was engaged in the field, i.e. the time before 1960 is not included. The aim of this paper is not to provide an overview of the individual philosophers in Estonia at the time and their works, but to give a more general description of the philosophy of the Soviet era. The Soviet and the East European philosophy of the time have received rather little critical treatment in literature in English. However, a few general overviews trying to prove that this Soviet and East European philosophical legacy is worth studying have still been published. This paper is focused on the question what kind of philosophical researches it was possible to engage oneself in under the abnormal conditions at the time and whether some starting points and problem issues in theseresearches might be viable also today. Estonian experience confirms the general conclusion of these authors who, analyzing the legacy of Marxism, have found that although Marxism is nowadays—not to mention how it existed in the Soviet totalitarian regime—mainly not considered a serious philosophy but rather an ideological basis of a failed political doctrine, it has nevertheless quite something to offer when treated in a more depoliticized manner, in the general context of philosophical quests.Teoreetiline ja teadusfilosoofia Nõukogude ajal: mõned märkused Eesti näitel 1960-1990 (Resümee)Vaatluse all on Eesti näitel ja lähtudes Tartu ülikoolist see osa Nõukogudeaegsest filosoofiast, mis vastab umbes teoreetilisele filosoofiale ja teadusfilosoofiale. Autor peatub ajavahemikul umbes 1960–1990, mil ta ka ise tegev oli, st 1960-ndate aastate eelset aega ei käsitleta. Artikli eesmärgiks ei ole ülevaate andmine Eestis sel ajal tegutsenud filosoofidest ja nende töödest, vaid Nõukogudeaegse filosoofia üldisem iseloomustamine. Nõukogude ja selleagset Ida-Euroopa filosoofiat on ingliskeelses kirjanduses üsna vähe kriitiliselt uuritud. Üksikuid ülevaateteoseid, milles on püütud näidata, etsee Nõukogude ja Ida-Euroopa filosoofiline pärand väärib uurimist, on siiski ilmunud. Käesolevas artiklis on keskendutud eelkõige küsimusele, mis laadi filosoofilise uurimistööga sai tolle aja ebanormaalsetes tingimustes tegelda ja kas mõned lähtekohad ja probleemipüstitused selles on elujõulised ka veel nüüd. Eesti kogemus kinnitab nende autorite üldist järeldust, kes marksismi pärandit uurides on leidnud, et kuigi marksismi tänapäeval — rääkimata sellest, missugune see oli Nõukogude totalitaarses režiimis — enamasti ei peeta tõsiseltvõetavaks filosoofiaks, vaid pigem läbikukkunud poliitilise õpetuse ideoloogiliseks aluseks, on tal siiski nii mõndagi öelda, kui teda käsitleda depolitiseeritumalt, filosoofiliste otsingute üldises kontekstis.  Märksõnad: dialektiline materialism, dialektika, ‘eessõna-marksism’, filosoofia põhiküsimus, Nõukogude filosoofia, ‘ontologistid’ ja ‘epistemologistid’, praktika"
10.12697/spe.2015.8.2.02,What is Estonian Philosophy?,"The purpose of this article is to inquire what should belong in an encyclopedia article entitled ""Estonian philosophy,"" should one ever endeavour to write it. The question ""What is Estonian philosophy?"" has two parts. First we have to know what we mean by the concept philosophy and after that how we would specify Estonian philosophy? Relying on a Wittgensteinian approach, I will argue that philosophy is an open concept. Although all philosophical works have some resemblances to other philosophical works, it is impossible to find criteria characteristic of all the varieties of schools and traditions in which philosophizing is carried out. Philosophy should be understood as a certain social practice. There can, however, be a large number of different practices. I will show that if by Estonian philosophy we have in mind a philosophy that is originally and purely Estonian, then at this point such does not exist. If by Estonian philosophy we mean philosophy created in Estonia, regardless of the practitioners' ethnicity and the language in which they wrote, the history of our philosophy is very rich and diverse. People of many different ethnicities have created philosophy in Estonia, articulating their philosophical ideas in Estonian, English, German, Latin, Russian, and Swedish. And if we broaden our concept of Estonian philosophy to also include the work of philosophers of Estonian extraction living abroad, then one could write quite a respectable article on the topic."
10.30899/dfj.v10i35.101,Constitutional social rights without a social security philosophy,"Brazilian constitutional law has a broad and multidimensional conception of fundamental rights. The so-called Welfare Rights are part of them. They are not only formally grounded on Title II, the Bill of Fundamental Rights, but are also protected by particular Constitutional Actions established as means for judicial implementation thereof. Welfare Rights as healthcare, social insurance and social care services for the most vulnerable, enjoy, therefore, a preferential position within the Brazilian system of constitutional rights. This article maintains that in spite of adopting a strong constitutional framework for healthcare, social insurance and socialcare services, the lack of a consistent and coherent political philosophy for welfare state seriously undermine the progressive implementation of these constitutional rights. In the first part the manuscript seeks to clarify the causes of this circumstance of recognition of health, socialcare and social insurance as fundamental rights without equivalent recognition of social security as a proper human right. Afterwards, the article is particularly concerned with the features of the judicialization of social rights. As a matter of conclusion, the article points out this situationas a paradox by addressing the lack of a proper philosophy of social security in a context of strong constitutional protection for health, social insurance and social care services."

It is the complexity of regulatory system that causes the inefficiency. In order to deal with this problem, the integrated management philosophy was put forward to reduce the complexity and increased transparency. Then we designed the three dimensional integrated regulatory mode according to the regulatory principles. The system operation was emphasized on discussing the implementation procedures, designing operation procedures. This model may provide a new perspective for optimizing government regulatory mechanism."
10.29235/2524-2369-2018-63-4-409-417,Trust discourse in existential philosophy,"The conceptual analysis of the problematization of the crisis of trust in the context of existential philosophy is performed in the article, paying special attention to the specificity of the ambivalent interpretation of the ontological and phenomenological levels of trust as the value basis for social interaction. Addressing the works of K. Jaspers, M. Buber, O. F. Bollnov, N. Abbagnano, the ways of overcoming the crisis bases of trust and the conditions of the “possibility of possibilities” of trust as a positive existential of responsible coexistence are analyzed. The conceptualization of trust as an existential self-determination in the horizons of reliability of world and readiness for vulnerability is presented.An existential analytics of the phenomenological level of trust in the interpretation of strategies of critical optimism and suspicion practices is proposed, which allowed us to consider the constructive and destructive effects of trust in terms of meaningful problems of choice, fear, anxiety, concern, freedom, responsibility in the “trust-to-the-world” and “trust-to-Other” horizons, conceptualizing internal and external resources of basic expectations of reliability, security, optimistic openness and pulsating humanity."
10.1093/oso/9780198714057.001.0001,The Quantum Revolution in Philosophy,"Quantum theory launched a revolution in twentieth-century physics. But we have yet to appreciate the revolution’s significance for philosophy. Most studies of the conceptual foundations of quantum theory first try to interpret the theory—to say how the world could possibly be the way the theory says it is. But, though fundamental, quantum theory is enormously successful without describing the world in its own terms. When properly applied, models of quantum theory offer good advice on the significance and credibility of claims about the world expressed in other terms. This first of several philosophical lessons of the quantum revolution dissolves the quantum measurement problem. Pragmatist treatments of probability and causation show how quantum theory may be used to explain the non-localized correlations that have been thought to involve ‘spooky’ instantaneous action at a distance. Given environmental decoherence, a pragmatist inferentialist approach to content shows when talk of quantum probabilities is licensed, resolves any residual worries about whether a quantum measurement has a determinate outcome, and solves a dilemma about the ontology of a quantum field theory. This approach to meaning and reference also reveals the nature and limits of objective description in the light of quantum theory. While these pragmatist approaches to probability, causation, explanation, and content may be independently motivated by philosophical argument, their successful application here illustrates their practical importance in helping philosophers come to terms with the quantum revolution."

The key of Open University construction is the teachers’ team building, and the teachers’ professional development is the most important part. Open University teachers’ professional development has not fit for our teaching requirements any more. The rapid development of information society put forward some severe challenges to Open University teachers’ professional development. Under the view of philosophy of technology, fit for the request of the new situation, It must have some progress on Open University teachers’ professional development: first, to improve the professional academic level; second, to improve the teaching skills; third, to improve the information technology.

10.24297/jap.v12i2.163,The Philosophy of Space-Time: Whence Cometh Matter and Motion?,"From the macrocosm to the microcosm, natural science has so far confirmedÂ  the most fundamental assertion of materialist dialectics that there can be no matter without motion and no motion without matter. This view of the objective reality is in sharp conflict with the one proposed by Albert Einstein in his theory of General Relativity (GR). According to Einstein, â€œSince the theory of general relativity (GR) implies the representation of physical reality by a continuous field, the concept of particles and material points cannot play a fundamental part and neither can the concept of motion. The particle can only appear as a limited region in space in which the field strength or energy density is particularly highâ€(1).This article offers a dialectical perspective of the internal dynamics of Space-Time-Matter-Motion of the infinite universe, mediated by the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. It is at the same time a refutation of the finite,Â  non-material and abstract four dimensional spacetime geometric manifold as the ontological basis of objective reality, proposed by Minkowski andÂ  Einstein."

10.5604/01.3001.0010.1995,"Sharing talk, sharing cognition: philosophy with children as the basis for productive classroom interaction","Taking the linguistic turn requires an examination of the relationship between thought and language: starting with Wittgenstein, we draw out the implications of expressing thought in a jointlyconstructed system of meaning. We then examine the relationship between thought and language in a pedagogical context by drawing on the practice of philosophy with children in the classroom, identifying key skills which are important in the development of meaningful classroom interaction, connecting this to philosophy with children practice. We go on to explore the consequences of educational attainment for those children who enter school with impoverished language, referring to a number of key studies, including our own, which highlight the detrimental effects not only on children’s outcomes at school, but also their ability to become equal inhabitants of a linguistic space. Therefore we argue that a focus on oracy skills crucially underpins wider outcomes. We conclude by looking at ways in which oracy skills can be developed in the classroom, arguing that although there are other techniques for developing oracy skills in the classroom, philosophy with children provides the most comprehensive way of doing this."

10.4028/www.scientific.net/amm.592-594.652,Optimization of Tensile Strength during Ultrasonic Lap Welding of Dissimilar Metals Using Taguchi’s Philosophy,"Ultrasonic welding (USW) is a solid-state joining process in which the joint is created between the workpieces by the application of high frequency ultrasonic waves under pressure. Poor weld strength is one of the major problem experienced in the application of such weldments. It is mainly due to improper selection of process parameters. In order to achieve satisfactory weld strength optimization of welding process parameters is indeed essential. In this present context, the USW has been carried out to join dissimilar materials like A1100 aluminum alloy and CuZn37 brass plates of thickness 0.1 mm using Taguchi’s L16 orthogonal array design of experiments. The process parameters like amplitude, weld pressure and weld time have been taken into consideration. Taguchi’s S/N ratio concept has been employed to study the effect of different process parameters on the response like tensile strength; and finally, the optimum setting of process parameters has been decided in view of maximizing tensile strength. The predicted result of the optimized tensile strength has been validated by conducting a confirmatory test. This analysis shows that the high quality and efficient joints can be generated by exploring optimized setting of process parameters which is fruitful in mass production as well as off-line quality control of such a welding practice."

10.3390/arts7040073,“Utopias Are for Those Who Cannot Build”: The Structural Philosophy of the Swedish National Board of Building,"Structuralism in architecture was a widespread international phenomenon in the post-war decades. It was an avant-garde architecture, in many cases even utopian. In contrast to this, the structural philosophy of the Swedish National Board of Building was outspokenly pragmatic. This article, based on documents and interviews with the architects involved, gives the background of the National Board’s interest in “the chronological dimension of architecture”. The National Board was the largest client in Sweden for design and building and experienced managers of a large building stock. In the mid-1960s, they developed, in cooperation with consultants, a “building box” for office buildings. They gladly showed a lack of interest or downright scepticism towards international structuralism: “Utopias are for those who cannot build”. Two of the main involved practices were A4 and ELLT, later merged into Coordinator architects, and from early on focused on an architecture of change. Two of their iconic projects from the late 1960s are the large office block Garnisonen and IBM Nordic Education Center. They are examples of a “consequence architecture”, very clearly “ideas based”. For a period around 1970 the pragmatic theory led to radical projects. “Dogmatic theorising was part of the game” as it was said about contemporary art."

He showed it to me soon after he had written it in 1942. It is only a sketch, but it struck me at once as important, because it opens a new approach to the conclusion he had reached many years before inFrom Religion to Philosophy. I told him this and begged him to pursue the subject, but he smiled and said, ‘I leave that to you’. Hence the title of this article, which is a tribute to his memory.HisFrom Religion to Philosophyappeared in 1913. In the same year Eduard Norden published hisAgnostos Theos: Untersuchungen zur Formengeschichte religiöser Rede. In this study, starting from the Sermon on the Areopagus, Norden shows that the Greek and Latin authors employ, in poetry and prose, certain forms of speech, liturgical in origin, which can be traced independently in the Old Testament. The two streams, the Hellenic and the Hebrew, drawn from Babylonia and Egypt, were reunited in Christianity, notably by St. Paul, who, in virtue of his birth and upbringing, was equally well versed in both. Later, in the Byzantine liturgy, they were reinforced by a third stream, the Syrian, of the same ultimate origin."

And I propose to begin by giving a fairly full, though necessarily very imperfect, synopsis of the old philosophy against which the new doctrines reacted and which they superseded. What I shall describe with the name of the ‘old philosophy’ is the theory of the universe which St Thomas had elaborated on the basis of such knowledge of the works of Aristotle as was available to him."

Articles fall into three general categories: received views in philosophy of economics, on-going controversies in microeconomics, and issues in modeling, macroeconomics, and development.

10.5399/uo/konturen.7.0.3673,"Tragedy, History, and the Form of Philosophy in Either/Or","Kierkegaard’s essay “The Tragic in Ancient Drama Reflected in the Tragic in Modern Drama,” makes two basic claims of far-reaching consequences for the theory of the tragedy and for philosophy more generally. The first is the claim that the essence of tragedy in all its historical manifestations consists in the representation of an irreducible contradiction between two qualitatively distinct principles: substantial determinants and individual agency. The second is Kierkegaard’s contention that, within this essence, the difference between the genre’s ancient and its modern forms rests on the different relations to that contradiction, on whether it is accepted as an objective fact or as a reflexive possibility. In the present article I elucidate Kierkegaard’s argument in terms of these two claims and point to some of their larger implications. With respect to the first, I show that it introduces a significant challenge to the conception of historical time on which our category of modernity depends. As concerns the second, I argue that it constitutes an engagement with what Kant calls as the modality of judgments (whether an object is possible, actual, or necessary), which Kierkegaard here attacks in the version given to it by the young F.W.J. Schelling. Kierkegaard’s rejection of Schelling’s argument on this point goes to the heart of the idealist project and ultimately questions what the form of philosophy should be."
10.5399/uo/konturen.7.0.3679,Clouds: The Tyranny of Irony over Philosophy,"Both Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche maintained an abiding concern for Socrates throughout their productive lives. Kierkegaard wrote his dissertation on irony through a Socratic lens and Nietzsche once declared that try as he might, he could not completely separate his concerns from those he associated with the Greek. &#x0D;
Kierkegaard famously favored Aristophanes’ portrait of Socrates in his comedy Clouds, claiming that it accurately portrayed the illegibility of the ironist. Nietzsche leaned toward Xenophon’s Socratic writings but most famously blamed Plato’s Socrates for the demise of tragic culture. Kierkegaard and Nietzsche engaged with the variety of Socratic depictions throughout their careers and perhaps more importantly, both employed irony in a Socratic fashion inflected by textual concerns. In other words, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche understood irony as both the indication of an epistemological limit, and as a strategy to induce the reader to think herself into the text. My article “Clouds: The Tyranny of Irony over Philosophy” analyzes this common concern and its implications for our understanding of European modernity."

10.11113/umran2018.5n2.236,An Islamic perspective of the natural environment and animals: Said Nursi and his renewalist philosophy,"Contemporary Muslim scholar Said Nursi’s (1877-1960) view of animals is highly spiritual. His positive thinking philosophy extends to the natural environment and includes animals considered harmful to humans. His view of not killing harmful animals contradicts with the majority Islamic scholarly works which permit the killing of detrimental ones. His understanding of the interconnectedness of natural beings and things as well as their connection to the Divine is the major source for his works. Nursi views each created thing as a piece of the puzzle of the universe in harmony with each other. To him, animals have a deep spiritual aspect alongside their physical dimension. This article argues that throughout his works, Nursi – with his unique perspectives on spiritual approaches towards the environment and devotion to the creation – more than any other Islamic scholar, defended the Islamic view against naturalists and attempted to Islamicize natural philosophy by addressing theists. He views nature as art not the Artist. This article examines Nursi’s positive thinking and actions towards animals as he presents a renewed interpretation of Islamic sacred sources."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190491192.013.1,Dewey’s Conception of Philosophy,"Dewey campaigned for a “recovery” or a “reconstruction” of philosophy. He did not see philosophy as having come to an end, but, instead, hoped to find a radically new way of continuing. This chapter seeks to understand what he had in mind and to recommend it. At different stages of his career, Dewey offered characterizations so different that it seems he had no single conception of philosophy; however, when his writings are seen as contributions to a large project of fostering human social progress, the diverse accounts of philosophy can be reconciled. Further, recognizing the important role philosophy is to play in progressive inquiry and progressive social practice enables us to understand why Dewey’s writings proceed at distinct levels. The changes he advocates mark a decisive shift in the way philosophy is to be done."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190491192.013.26,Dewey and Environmental Philosophy,"Though environmental philosophers trace the roots of environmental awareness to the decades of John Dewey’s prominence, Dewey himself was conspicuously mum about the environmental controversies of his day. A Deweyan environmental pragmatism, then, must find sustenance in less prosaically environmental themes of the American philosopher’s project. This chapter attends to Dewey’s notion of organism-environment interaction, which is at the core of Dewey’s understanding of experience and which informs Dewey’s philosophy from epistemology to aesthetics. The chapter stresses that Dewey’s notion of organism-environment interaction is an account of how organisms dynamically respond to changes in their environment. However, contrary to several misinterpretations of environmental pragmatism, this dynamic responsiveness is not a call for human control over nature. Indeed, we conclude that an environmental philosophy oriented by Dewey’s notion of organism-environment interaction provides promising approaches to interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and environmental justice."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190491192.013.23,Philosophy and the Mirror of Culture,"Philosophy of language—the dominant philosophy of the American academy—is central to the rise of Donald Trump. To philosophers, this claim may seem as surprising as Trump’s presidency. Neither would have surprised John Dewey. In German Philosophy and Politics (1915), Dewey claimed that World War I was inevitable thanks to the Kantian philosophical commitments that informed German culture, such as the separation of reason from experience and an absolute sense of duty. In the 1943 edition, Dewey argued that Hitler’s rise and World War II depended on these same commitments. German philosophy was a mirror of German culture that provided a “definitely practical aid” in realizing the ends it reflected. Today, the mirror of American culture is the philosophy of the linguistic turn exemplified by the work of Robert Brandom. This chapter considers this link and argues for a recovery of a Deweyan pluralist philosophy of resistance and freedom."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190491192.013.34,John Dewey and Pragmatist Feminist Philosophy,"John Dewey’s record as a feminist and an advocate of women is mixed. He valued women intellectual associates whose influences he acknowledged, but did not develop theoretical articulations of the reasons for women’s subordination and marginalization. Given his mixed record, this chapter asks, how useful is Dewey’s work as a resource for feminist philosophy? It begins with a survey of the intellectual influences that connect Dewey with a set of women family members, colleagues, and students. It then discusses Dewey’s influence on the work of late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century pragmatist feminist philosophers. Dewey’s influence has been strongest in the fields of feminist epistemology, philosophy of education, and social and political philosophy. Although pragmatist feminist philosophy remains a small field within feminist philosophy, this chapter argues that its conceptual resources could be put to further good use, particularly in feminist metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190491192.013.27,Dewey and Public Philosophy,"Of late many philosophers have taken up the mantle of public philosophy, but, unlike Dewey, many think that the goal is to perform philosophy in public, to broadcast widely their arguments, or become renowned as public intellectuals. Many aim to improve the public, to help people think more rationally and critically, argue more deliberatively and logically, and perhaps see the light about philosophical matters. But Dewey shows that none of such work is democratic, for it usurps the role of a public to identify problems and their sources and skips over any need for public deliberation on what should be done. From a Deweyan perspective, the key for public philosophy is to remember that public problems are best fathomed by the public itself, which may enlist experts or governments to fix the problems but alone is the best judge of what needs to be addressed and whether the remedy is successful."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190491192.013.25,"Dewey, Habermas, and the Unfinished Project of Modernity in Unmodern Philosophy and Modern Philosophy","John Dewey’s Unmodern Philosophy and Modern Philosophy aspires to overcome the antiquated philosophical baggage of so-called “modern” philosophy and replace it with a philosophy that is truly modern, having incorporated the technoscientific revolution. As the philosophical revolution is incomplete, so is Dewey’s own text. In an attempt to flesh out a Deweyan conception of modernity, this chapter turns to another philosopher who has argued that modernity is still an unfinished project: Jürgen Habermas. This chapter compares their accounts of the meaning of modernity, its pathologies, and their proposed cures through a turn from subjective reason to intersubjective action and concludes that their essential difference lies in the emancipatory potential of scientific-technological reason itself."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190491192.013.24,Idealism and Religion in Dewey’s Philosophy,"Dewey’s early organicist idealism related individual selves to God as functional parts of the absolute whole. His critiques of idealists T. H. Green and Josiah Royce exemplify his concern that no dualistic gap separates the knower from the object of knowledge. After he replaced the perfect absolute with the dynamic activity of life, two principles became paramount for Dewey’s mature philosophy. Metaphysically, all of human experience is within the same reality as everything else that is also real: nothing about experience segregates it apart from the rest of what is real. Epistemologically, an account of experience’s continuity with the rest of reality is compatible with understanding that continuity: nothing about experience prevents our knowing how experiences are within reality. Experience is ontologically continuous with nature, and inquiry creates the natural objects of knowledge. A Common Faith exemplifies this metaphysics as it explains the ethical growth of communities through religious experience."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190491192.013.7,The Starting Point of Dewey’s Ethics and Sociopolitical Philosophy,"In order to appreciate the radical and promising character of Dewey’s ethics and sociopolitical theory, we must understand how his approach in these areas of philosophy was a consequence of what he thought should be the starting point of philosophy, that is, his metaphilosophy. Dewey prescribed that philosophers should make an effort to be “empirical” and to take “experience” seriously, but these claims are subject to misunderstandings. The first section of this chapter clarifies what they mean. The second section considers the difference that Dewey’s form of empirical philosophy makes in ethics and third section the difference it makes in approaching sociopolitical problems. Dewey proposes a much more radical approach than similar contemporary approaches that are interested in a shift from traditional approaches centered on ideal theories and abstractions toward a more nonideal contextualist, problem-centered, and inquiry-oriented approach."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198718284.013.21,Philosophy of Education,"This chapter maintains that Newman does not fit neatly into either the philosophical or rhetorical traditions of thought about liberal education; rather, as a controversialist, he dialectically combines both approaches. In his writings about learning (the Oxford University Sermon on Wisdom, ‘The Tamworth Reading Room’, Idea of a University, Rise and Progress of Universities), Newman distinguishes the important functions of theology and the Catholic Church from the single, essential goal of liberal education, namely the development of a philosophical habit of mind. He brings out the dialectical tensions in the polarities of university and college, professor and tutor, personal influence and discipline, and in particular intellectual development and morality. The chapter takes on various interpreters and critics of Newman’s educational views, both during his lifetime—for example, the utilitarian ‘Knowledge School’ of Peel, Brougham, and Bentham—and in the scholarship of today."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199945726.013.16,Japanese Neo-Confucian Philosophy,"This study explores Neo-Confucianism as a set of philosophical teachings that developed in distinctive ways in Japan. The study suggests that virtually all expressions of Confucian philosophy from Song times forward, in the wake of centuries of Buddhist domination of China and most of East Asia, were expressions of Neo-Confucianism. The study emphasizes differences between Japanese Neo-Confucianism and Chinese and Korean Neo-Confucianism by highlighting the distinctive relationships between Japanese Neo-Confucianism, Christianity, and Shinto, noting how, on the one hand, Japanese Neo-Confucians generally opposed Christianity as a foreign heterodoxy but, on the other, often embraced Shinto as a comparable expression of many of its own ideas, especially those found in the Book of Changes. The study also examines Neo-Confucian ideas in Meiji Japan, noting how they contributed to the Freedom and People’s Rights Movement of the mid-Meiji, but also to late-Meiji conservatism and the subsequent rise of nationalist ideological expressions."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199945726.013.25,Nishitani Keiji on Practicing Philosophy as a Matter of Life and Death,"This chapter offers an existential approach to those aspects of Nishitani’s philosophy that are motivated by a profound sense of the utter meaninglessness of existence and by the desire to confront that situation honestly. It examines his idea of the three fields of awareness: consciousness, (beneath it) nihility, and (at bottom) emptiness. Existence on the field of consciousness is too superficial to make for a fulfilling life. Drawing from Nietzsche and Heidegger, as well as from the Zen tradition, Nishitani outlines the field of nihility as a place of death rather than life and argues that if we can endure facing our finitude there will come a turn to the deeper field, of emptiness. On this field, we are able to encounter things “on their home ground” for the first time and also our selves as participants in the network of relations that constitute the world as “a field of force.”"
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199945726.013.1,The Place of God in the Philosophy of Tanabe Hajime,"Tanabe Hajime (1885–1962) was one of the pivotal figures in the Kyoto School. The present essay focuses on his idea of God as a gateway to understanding the unfolding of his major philosophical ideas. Despite criticisms of the Christian God, Tanabe gradually transformed the notion in the light of his rediscovery of Buddhist thought and the elaboration of ideas of absolute nothingness, the cultural specificity of rationality, and historical praxis. After a brief capitulation to nationalist thinking during the Pacific War, he undertook a radical rethinking of the philosophical vocation and took a more conciliatory approach to religious faith. His idea of God transformed into a “nothingness-in-love” and the appeal to supporting Christian ideas became a regular feature in his writings. The essay concludes with an attempt to locate an underlying motivation for Tanabe’s concern with the idea of God."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199945726.013.28,Comparative Philosophy in Japan,"This chapter discusses the comparative philosophies of two premier comparativists of postwar Japan, Nakamura Hajime and Izutsu Toshihiko. Both were known as accomplished scholars within their respective fields—Buddhist studies and Indology for Nakamura, and Islamic studies for Izutsu—when they initiated their comparative projects. Each had a distinct vision of what comparison entails and the sort of philosophy it would produce. Nakamura’s project was a world history of ideas that uncovers basic patterns in the unfolding of human thought. Izutsu aims to reconstruct Oriental philosophy on the basis of certain key concepts common to the traditions. The chapter covers the aims, methods, and philosophical achievements of their comparative projects. In their juxtaposition, it makes evident significant differences in their projects, methods, and results."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199945726.013.19,The Japanese Encounter with and Appropriation of Western Philosophy,"The appropriation of Western philosophy in Japan in the Meiji Period came about through a transformation of the Japanese language. It occasioned a new way of articulating thought that allowed Japanese to make philosophy their own, a discipline proper to the ongoing formation of their culture. This process helped redefine Japan’s past intellectual traditions, interpreting them in the light of Western philosophical concepts and problems. “Enlightenment” Scholars like Nishi Amane, Fukuzawa Yukichi, and Katō Hiroyuki created neologisms, altered traditional styles of writing, and introduced concepts new to Japanese tradition. Later philosophers like Inoue Tetsujirō and Inoue Enryō adapted European philosophical categories to recast old traditions and renew them as relevant for a modernized Japan. In their day, much of their terminology and argumentation was exotic and enigmatic, even while their style appears archaic today. A recognizably twentieth-century philosophical idiom had to wait for thinkers like Ōnishi Hajime and Nishida Kitarō."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199945726.013.33,Japanese (and Ainu) Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art,"Japanese aesthetics have impacted global arts and aesthetics through traditional, modern, and post-modern aesthetic categories (mononoaware, iki, or moe, haikyo respectively) and qualities (vagueness, spontaneity). This chapter traces accomplishments of Japanese aesthetics, analyzes their complexities, highlights some challenges to philosophy of art, and introduces some emerging aesthetics and new analyses of traditional aesthetics, including Ainu. Japanese aesthetics offer valuable opportunities for developing abilities that extend, modify, and deepen our range of emotional, sensory, and artistic feeling (joy, awareness of seasonal change, the beauty of folk arts) commonly recognized as the purview of aesthetics. They also enhance a range of cognitive skills, such as comprehending the ineffable, and strengthen social and personal skills such as expressing individuality, experiencing community, encountering the other and the land, and/or surviving atomic destruction. Sections address the unparalleled millennia-old importance of women’s gaze/voices and the interactions of aesthetics with fascism and with war."

10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199945726.013.29,Yuasa Yasuo’s Philosophy of Self-Cultivation,"This chapter articulates Yuasa’s thought on how human beings can transform the everyday standpoint of existence into an extraordinary standpoint by engaging in the practice of self-cultivation or a move from disjunctive dualism to correlative dualism. To explain this, he devises his own body scheme in terms of four information circuits: (1) the external-sensory-motor circuit, (2) the circuit of coenesthesis comprised of kinesthesis and somesthesis, (3) the emotion-instinct circuit, and (4) the circuit of the unconscious quasi-body. In explaining the transformative process of deepening awareness, which one gains by moving from the first circuit to the fourth circuit, Yuasa also provides a methodological reflection on how the philosophy of self-cultivation deems that practice is more important than theory. By making the perspectival shift to the extraordinary standpoint, he concludes that human beings are “beings-in-nature” in contrast to the Western philosophical perspective of “beings-outside-of-nature.”"
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199945726.013.37,The Controversial Cultural Identity of Japanese Philosophy,"This chapter discusses controversies surrounding the cultural identity of Japanese philosophy. Often presented as offering the first “non-Western universalism” over against Eurocentrism, authors have struggled to establish its distinctness, and this endeavor has been mired in questions of essentialism, Japanese imperialism, and cultural nationalism. The exemplary case of Nishida Kitarō’s New World Order essay is examined, and issues surrounding the identity of Japanese philosophy are analyzed historically as well as in the contemporary context of global neo-colonialism. The last section offers an alternative interpretation of Nishida, by way of a first-person approach, in order to produce an existential critical theory aiming at a “decolonized world order.”"
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199945726.013.21,The Development of Nishida’s Philosophy,"This chapter introduces the thought of Japan’s most significant and influential modern philosopher, Nishida Kitarō (1870–1945), by tracing its development through three major periods. The key concept of his early thought is “pure experience” (junsui keiken), which is said to precede the separation of subject and object. In his middle period, Nishida deals with the relation between direct experience and reflective thinking, resulting in his development of a logic of “place” (basho), which, in contrast to Aristotelian logic, seeks the underlying basis for judgments in the direction of the predicate rather than the grammatical subject. Nishida’s constant concern was to elucidate the most concrete experience of reality. In his later period, he rethinks this most fundamental level of experience, which he understands to be the basis for scientific knowledge as well as artistic creativity, in terms of “action-intuition” (kōi-teki chokkan)."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199660896.013.38,Literature and Philosophy,"This chapter proposes that our very notions of ‘literature’ and ‘philosophy’ are, to a great extent, forged in the Romantic era. The chapter surveys the eighteenth-century background to this issue in the sceptical empiricism of David Hume and the German transcendental idealism of Immanuel Kant, F. W. von Schelling, and J. G. Fichte. In examining the writings of William Blake, Edmund Burke, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, and William Hazlitt, it also charts the ways in which the revolutionary debates of the 1790s politicized the disciplines of philosophy and ‘theory’, leading to an anti-philosophical rhetoric in the work of writers such as Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Lamb, and Lord Byron. Finally, the chapter scrutinizes the boundaries between Romantic philosophy and the Scottish common-sense philosophy of Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, before examining the philosophical significance of the idea of ‘Literature’ in the work of Romantic writers, particularly Percy Shelley and John Keats."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199945726.013.30,Postwar Japanese Political Philosophy,"When examining political thought in post-1945 Japan, we must acknowledge that the postwar philosophical landscape was fundamentally a trans-war one. Narratives that sought to rationalize the past war laid the foundations for a divided consciousness after the war that entrenched antagonistic opposites as the parameters for postwar discourse. State versus self, politics versus ethics, theory versus value, ideas versus action and intellectuals versus “ordinary” people were all manifestations of the desire in the postwar era to establish ethical legitimacy through the dynamic of normative distancing. Paramount in this endeavor was an insistence by Japan’s postwar thinkers on creating and maintaining a hostile separation between civil society and the state as the proof of a rehabilitated ethos for postwar democracy. This conceptual framing had consequences for postwar thought and how it was articulated. In effect, the retrospective fragmentation of subjective responsibility led to the alienation of politics and value in the postwar era, preventing the coherence of subjectivity and responsibility upon which the integrity of the trans-war narrative depended."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199945726.013.12,The Philosophy of Zen Master Dōgen,"Dōgen Kigen (1200–1253) was the founder of the Sōtō school of Japanese Zen Buddhism, and he is widely held to be the most significant philosopher in the Zen tradition. The kernel of his thought is expressed in his most famous text, Genjōkōan, rendered here as “The Presencing of Truth.” This chapter explicates the key ideas of this text, offering in particular an interpretation of its epistemological implications. It argues that Dōgen’s view of enlightenment as an ongoing practice of enlightening, as an unending path of discovery, implies an egoless perspectivism. It is a perspectivism insofar as reality is understood to only ever show itself one aspect at a time. In delusion, this perspective gets narrowly determined by the will of the ego. In the practice of enlightenment or enlightening, however, the self “forgets itself” in the “total exertion” of a participatory engagement in the world, and truth presences in and through such nondual events of interconnectivity."
10.3846/cs.2018.349,CONSTITUTIVE AND DEPICTIVE CREATIVITIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND CRITICAL THINKING,"This paper expounds two types of creativities in philosophy while exploring several influential philosophical views and thought experiments. The two types of creativities include constitutive creativity and depictive creativity. Constitutive creativity refers to the capabilities required for constructing theoretical equipment or tools needed to constitute the core of a given philosophical thought. It can be assessed in terms of the appropriateness of the theoretical apparatuses used in the target idea. The embodiment of constitutive creativity is often coupled with depictive creativity. Depictive creativity refers to the abilities to cite striking examples or build narratives that support the issue at hand. The assessment of depictive creativity depends on the ingenuity of the examples or stories insofar as they positively contribute to the establishment of the desired conclusion. While elucidating the notions of constitutive and depictive creativities by examining several examples in the literature of philosophy, I highlight that critical thinking operates as the cornerstone on top of which both types of creativities may be built."
10.3390/philosophies3040035,The Natural Philosophy of Experiencing,"A new philosophy of nature is urgently needed. The received ontological view, physicalism, is unable to account for experiential phenomena and in particular for consciousness in all its varieties. We shall outline the concept of experiencing which should figure as a new conceptual primitive in natural philosophy. Experiencing refers to a process which comprises the interaction of an agent with its world through action based on phenomenal experience. This process can be viewed under two different aspects. One regards the subjective aspect of experiencing, the other one regards it in terms of physical objects. The first case illustrates the “what-it-is-likeness” of experiencing, the second illustrates how experiencing gets “objectified” in nature. We furthermore wish to delineate our concept of experiencing from the concept of (meta-cognitive) awareness. Scientific theories that explain how awareness comes about in sufficiently organized brains should respect the distinction between experiencing and awareness. We also sketch how experiencing could be related to theoretical biology in terms of information processing by organisms. Experiencing is non-exclusive; it refers to a primitive and a-personal natural process and not to a property possessed only by humans or other persons."
10.12697/spe.2009.2.2.03,If Intuitions Must Be Evidential then Philosophy is in Big Trouble,"Many philosophers claim that intuitions are evidential. Yet it is hard to see how introspecting one's mental states could provide evidence for such synthetic truths as those concerning, for example, the abstract and the counterfactual. Such considerations have sometimes been taken to lead to mentalism---the view that philosophy must concern itself only with matters of concept application or other mind-dependent topics suited to a contemplative approach---but this provides us with a poor account of what it is that philosophers take themselves to be doing, for many of them are concerned with the extra-mental facts about the universe. Evidentialism therefore gestates a disaster for philosophy, for it ultimately demands an epistemology for the investigation into such matter as the abstract and the modal that simply will not be forthcoming. We make a different suggestion: That intuitions are inclinations to believe. Hence, according to us, a philosophical argument does well, as a socio-rhetorical matter of fact, when it is founded on premises philosophers are generally inclined to believe, whether or not those inclinations to believe connect appropriately to the extra-mental facts. Accordingly, the role of intuitions (inclinations to believe) in philosophical methodology is non-evidential, and the question of how they could be used as evidence falls away."
10.12697/spe.2012.5.2.07,(Anti)Hermeneutical Philosophy for Science,"Philosophical hermeneutics claims that human understanding, while being contingent and historical, is likewise universal and bears within itself some pervasive features detectable via hermeneutical analyses of historically imparted tradition and language. Similarly, hermeneutical philosophy of science is confident that hermeneutical methods are the only proper tool to adequately assess, reconstruct, explain or give a meaning to historical but universal scientific knowledge and its various forms. I point out two versions of hermeneutical philosophy of science and argue that whenever philosophical hermeneutics pursues rescuing ""scientificity"", human rationality, human rights, common values, and so forth under the pretence of its universality and competence, it necessarily transcends and violates the tenets of its own. I conclude in the favour of moderate interpretation of practical hermeneutics, perhaps in the very essence of it rest postmodern concepts of historicality, transparency and tolerance, without which there is no possibility of extricating oneself from hermeneuticism. "
10.12697/spe.2009.2.2.09,Psychology and the Use of Intuitions in Philosophy,"There is widespread controversy about the use of intuitions in philosophy.  In this paper I will argue that there are legitimate concerns about this use, and that these concerns cannot be fully responded to using the traditional methods of philosophy.  We need an understanding of how intuitions are generated and what it is they are based on, and this understanding must be founded on the psychological investigation of the mind.  I explore how a psychological understanding of intuitions is likely to impact a range of philosophical projects, from conceptual analysis to the study of (non-conceptual) ""things themselves"" to experimental philosophy."
10.12697/spe.2012.5.2.06,Toward Pragmatically Naturalized Transcendental Philosophy of Scientific Inquiry And Pragmatic Scientific Realism,"This paper seeks to show that the turn toward local scientific practices in the philosophy of science is not a turn away from transcendental investigations. On the contrary, a pragmatist approach can very well be (re)connected with Kantian transcendental examination of the necessary conditions for the possibility of scientific representation and cognition, insofar as the a priori conditions that transcendental philosophy of science examines are understood as historically relative and thus potentially changing. The issue of scientific realism will be considered from this perspective, with special emphasis on Thomas Kuhn's conception of paradigms as frameworks making truth-valued scientific statements possible and on Charles S. Peirce's realism about ""real generals"". "
10.12697/spe.2009.2.2.07,Ideal Language Philosophy and Experiments on Intuitions,"Proponents of linguistic philosophy hold that all non-empirical philosophical problems can be solved by either analyzing ordinary language or developing an ideal one. I review the debates on linguistic philosophy and between ordinary and ideal language philosophy. Using arguments from these debates, I argue that the results of experimental philosophy on intuitions support linguistic philosophy. Within linguistic philosophy, these experimental results support and complement ideal language philosophy. I argue further that some of the critiques of experimental philosophy are in fact defenses of ideal language philosophy. Finally, I show how much of the current debate about experimental philosophy is anticipated in the debates about and within linguistic philosophy. Specifically, arguments by ideal language philosophers support experimental philosophy."

10.12697/spe.2009.2.2.10,Loose Constitutivity and Armchair Philosophy,"Standard philosophical methodology which proceeds by appeal to intuitions accessible ""from the armchair"" has come under criticism on the basis of empirical work indicating unanticipated variability of such intuitions. Loose constitutivity---the idea that intuitions are partly, but not strictly, constitutive of the concepts that appear in them---offers an interesting line of response to this empirical challenge. On a loose constitutivist view, it is unlikely that our intuitions are incorrect across the board, since they partly fix the facts in question. But we argue that this ratification of intuitions is at best rough and generic, and can only do the required methodological work if it operates in conjunction with some sort of further criteria of theory selection. We consider two that we find in the literature: naturalness (Brian Weatherson, borrowing from Lewis) and charity (Henry Jackman, borrowing from Davidson). At the end of the day, neither provides the armchair philosopher complete shelter from extra-armchair inquiry."
10.31192/np.14.2.1,Philosophy as a humanistic discipline,"The paper discusses how to situate philosophy with respect to the other fields of humanities. It is argued that there is no such thing as an independent or pure philosophical inquiry: the philosophical activity is always informed with insights, results and methods specific for either the sciences or the humanities. Philosophy is necessarily just a part of the collective endeavour to understand the world, which comprises various disciplines. As a consequence, there is no special problem of the relationship between philosophy and science, or between philosophy and humanities."
10.5194/gmd-10-3207-2017,Practice and philosophy of climate model tuning across six US modeling centers,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; Model calibration (or &lt;q&gt;tuning&lt;/q&gt;) is a necessary part of developing and testing coupled ocean–atmosphere climate models regardless of their main scientific purpose. There is an increasing recognition that this process needs to become more transparent for both users of climate model output and other developers. Knowing how and why climate models are tuned and which targets are used is essential to avoiding possible misattributions of skillful predictions to data accommodation and vice versa. This paper describes the approach and practice of model tuning for the six major US climate modeling centers. While details differ among groups in terms of scientific missions, tuning targets, and tunable parameters, there is a core commonality of approaches. However, practices differ significantly on some key aspects, in particular, in the use of initialized forecast analyses as a tool, the explicit use of the historical transient record, and the use of the present-day radiative imbalance vs. the implied balance in the preindustrial era as a target.&lt;/p&gt;

10.4018/978-1-4666-9619-8.ch058,Ethics Is Not Enough,"This chapter argues for understanding engineering ethics in terms of three principles—but then going beyond ethics to political theory. A simplified prefatory comparison between engineering and science points to the importance of ethics in engineering. Section 1 provides a historico-philosophical overview of engineering ethics in the United States, on the premise that American experience can be generally illuminating. The narrative traces a trajectory of commitments from company loyalty to public responsibility, with the public responsibility promoting public engagement. Section 2 considers three influential American cases that together suggest a duty to public disclosure. Section 3 broadens the analysis through selective reviews of engineering ethics profiles in Germany, The Netherlands, Japan, Chile, and in transnational professional engineering organizations, on the basis of which is articulated a duty not only to avoid harm but also to do good. Section 4, a critical reflection on engineering in the intensive form of research and design, posits a synthesis of the principles of participation, disclosure, and beneficence into a duty plus respicare, to take more into account. A concluding section nevertheless suggests the inadequacy of limiting engineering ethics to ethics. Ethics in engineering like ethics generally implicates political theory. Ethics in the absence of politics demands unrealistic personal heroism; political theory without any foundation in ethics promotes tyranny. "
10.26881/srg.2017.4.21,Citizen of the universe. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky’s cosmic philosophy and science fiction,"The paper discusses Konstantin Tsiolkovsky’s philosophy as it can be reconstructed from his writings of two kinds, the academic papers and the works generally, though not always correctly, classified as science fiction. It is stressed that Tsiolkovsky belongs to the large school of Russian philosophers known as the Cosmists, and he is placed within the group of 20th century academic-minded Cosmists. The first part of the paper reconstructs Tsiolkovsky’s cosmic philosophy on the basis of his philosophical works, which amount to half of his published works. The second part of the paper discusses all the works by Tsiolkovsky available in English under the science fiction label. The paper also contains comparisons of Tsiolkovsky’s views with the philosophicalreligious system propagated by Nicholas and Helena Roerich, known as Agni Yoga, and its ancient Indian roots. It is also mentioned that Tsiolkovsky played an important role in the development of the early Russian, or more properly Soviet, science fiction movies. The paper stresses that Tsiolkovsky always based his writings on solid scientific foundations, so that the label “science fiction” does not always apply to them."
10.4018/978-1-4666-9619-8.ch020,Seismic Retrofitting for Masonry Historical Buildings,"The static and seismic retrofitting design, for masonry historical buildings, has to follow a right hierarchy of interventions, taking into account that to improve the seismic behavior of a masonry structure, it is necessary to guarantee a “closed box” behavior for the whole structural body or, in case of complex buildings, to guarantee a closed box behavior for each building's wing. Thus it is fundamental to distinguish the interventions for the global behavior improvement from those related to local reinforcements. In this chapter is then proposed a scheme of interventions hierarchy and, therefore, a related design process road-map together with the explanation of a correct design philosophy for the static and seismic retrofitting of historical masonry buildings. Moreover it is also reported an example of two distinguished levels of intervention, with numerical analyses supporting that solution. "
10.22329/il.v26i3.454,Informal Logic’s Influence on Philosophy Instruction,"Informal logic began in the 1970s as a critique of then-current theoretical assumptions in the teaching of argument analysis and evaluation in philosophy departments in the U.S. and Canada. The last 35 years have seen significant developments in informal logic and critical thinking theory. The paper is a pilot study of the influence of these advances in theory on what is taught in courses on argument analysis and critical thinking in U.S. and Canadian philosophy departments. Its finding, provisional and much-qualified, is that the theoretical developments and refinements have had limited impact on instruction in leading philosophy departments."

The article focus is the main philosophical and scientific ideas of this problem of XX-XXI centuries.Materials and Methods: the base of this article is various developments of Russian and foreign researchers, who researched problem of the time reversibility with different approaches. The main chosen methods are critical analysis of the researched materials and the attempt on this base to synthesize identified contradictions and their solutions.Results: the interim result of this article is the statement that time reversibility is not logically controversial, but it is improbable. It was also noticed that the definition of time reversibility and the definition of time are a problem, therefore the possibility to speak about existing in nature or non-existing of the phenomenon depends on the researcher’s point of view.If we assume the possibility of time reversibility there appear a few paradoxes, which are Gibbs’ paradox, time’s multiplicity, causality leap, dead grandfather paradox.Not only philosophers and scientists were interested in those paradoxes, but also science-fiction writers who offered their own solutions. Today the Edinburg University philosophers and particularly A. Richmond are dealing with the problem, they also created the new direction of the philosophy named time travel philosophy. Richmond’s, his predecessors’ and Russian and foreign colleagues’ developments are presented in the paper; the attempt to find the contradictions in their approaches and the ways of its resolving has been also made.Discussion and conclusions: the main contradictions concerning the time reversibility are not ultimately resolved and still exist as a field for further discussion."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-7-7-23,Historiosophical Sources and Meanings of the Russian Philosophy of History,"The article analyzes the socio-cultural and theoretical origins of the Russian philosophy of history. These origins determined the development of the philosophy of history as a special feld of philosophical knowledge. This process took place in the second half of the 19th century, a significant factor of which was the split within the cultural and spiritual unity of Russian society on the wave of Alexander II’s reforms associated with the abolition of serfdom. In this period the subject-matter of the philosophy of history was defned. In the author’s opinion, the subject-matter of the philosophy of history includes: 1) the historical process in its universal human dimensions and in “past – present – future” movement, 2) the life of society in historically concrete forms of the organization of human community, 3) historical epistemology. The article shows why the philosophy of history, formed in this research feld, was established in the public consciousness and intellectual context as historiosophy, i.e. knowledge of spiritual senses, the beginning and end of history. This philosophical-historical paradigm excluded the oppositions, on the one hand, between philosophical knowledge and historical science and, on the other hand, between the philosophy of the history and social philosophy. As the main ideas of the Russian philosophy of history during that period, the author considers the idea of the integrity of historical existence as an “organic life” (Granovsky) and the idea of the variability of the historical process, interpreted as the constant inclination of history to “permanent improvisation” (Herzen). The author pays special attention to the development of the concepts of “transitional form” and “chaos,” which provide the acceleration of the progressive movement of history and the possibility of an active and responsible participation of an individual and masses in it. The attention to this problem introduced the spiritual and moral component into the ontological basis of the historical process as well as the concept of necessity and chance, freedom and violence, revolution and evolution into the conceptual apparatus of philosophical and historical knowledge. As a result, simultaneously with the metaphysical principles, the principles of concrete historical and axiological analysis were integrated into the methodology of the philosophy of history. This approach to the analysis of the historical process has preserved its heuristic potential to the present day."
10.1093/oso/9780198724957.001.0001,Kant and the Philosophy of Mind,"The essays in this volume explore those aspects of Kant’s writings which concern issues in the philosophy of mind. These issues are central to any understanding of Kant’s Critical philosophy and they bear upon contemporary discussions in the philosophy of mind. Fourteen specially written essays address such questions as: What role does mental processing play in Kant’s account of intuition? In what sense, and in what ways, are intuitions object-dependent? How should we understand the nature of the imagination and inner sense? What is the nature of the self, and in what ways are we aware of ourselves in self-consciousness? These essays showcase the depth of Kant’s writings in the philosophy of mind, and the centrality of those writings to his wider philosophical project. Moreover, they show the continued relevance of Kant’s writings to contemporary debates about the nature of mind and self."
10.18172/jes.158,Aphorisms and Philosophy : Contextualizing Aphoristic Texts-Assumptions about Subject-Matter,"This article analyses two current beliefs about the subject matter and the text-context relation of aphorisms. It is a commonly claimed that aphorisms are philosophical texts and that aphorisms are texts that function in isolation from any context. My hypothesis is that, instead of being descriptions of textual features, these beliefs act as conventions that prepare the field of reference for contextualizing texts and thus trigger a proper generic reading for certain kinds of aphoristic text. By helping to demystify some of the technical means of aphoristic writing (whose results are frequently described as concentrated or distilled wisdom), this hypothesis will highlight the importance of allusiveness for the current mainstream of aphorisms,. From the perspective of this article, aphorisms appear more as certain kinds of textual parasites, feeding off ‘contextual wisdom’, rather than being philosophical pills from the “wisdom of the ages”."
10.4018/978-1-5225-5673-2.ch010,Global Governance of Science,"This chapter draws attention to the role of education technologies within the entire issue of the global governance of science considered here to be of growing importance for the present world development. Introducing the notions of the global knowledge world and the knowledge society, the author presents the vision of the management of science as of an international task and one of development goals. He analyses the relationship of science and bureaucracy establishing a kind of a systematization for the decision-making process related to science and explains his point of view that the global governance of science could be based on the activities of international bodies and structures of intergovernmental nature (IIGOs), most importantly of UN and UNESCO, and of non-governmental character (INGOs). Taking into account various aspects of internal and external management of science, the author points out that the global management of science appears to be a life necessity due to the growing need to jointly search for global scientific responses to the global problems, new risks, and challenges that mankind is facing. In conclusion, some ideas are expressed and proposals given to foster the goal of the global governance of science. "

Beck, “Science and Philosophy: Comparison of Cognitive Therapy and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy”","The author largely agrees with Christine A. Padesky and Aaron T. Beck’s (2003) article, “Science and Philosophy: Comparison of Cognitive Therapy and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy,” disagrees with several of its statements about REBT, and particularly objects to Padesky and Beck’s view that the fundamental difference between CT and REBT is that the former therapy is empirically based and the latter is philosophically based."
10.17162/au.v0i1.307,Importancia y efectividad de la filosofía educativa adventista en Chile - Importance and effectiveness of Adventist educational philosophy in Chile,"El estudio procuró conocer la importancia que le asignan los alumnos de 4° medio de secundaria y 8° básico a diversos aspectos fundamentales de la filosofía de la educación adventista que deben ser practicados en las escuelas y liceos que la iglesia adventista mantiene en Chile. A su vez se observó cuánto están logrando los colegios en relación a estos objetivos filosóficos de la educación, también se realizó el análisis para determinar si existe diferencia significativa entre la importancia y el logro de las dimensiones religioso-espiritual y socio-académica y si éstas fueron afectadas por la filiación religiosa de quienes participaron en el estudio. La investigación se realizó durante el período escolar 2011 en 35 escuelas primarias y 20 colegios secundarios. En el estudio participaron un total de 2257 estudiantes, de las cuales 824 eran de la enseñanza secundaria y 1433 de la enseñanza primaria. Los resultados mostraron que existe  diferencia significativa entre la importancia y el logro de los objetivos de la filosofía educativa adventista. Por otro lado, se observó que los estudiantes de 4° medio de filiación adventista y los que no profesan religión se muestran menos satisfechos que los católicos en cuanto a los logros de las escuelas y liceos adventistas en los objetivos filosóficos, en cambio los estudiantes de 8° básico coinciden en su satisfacción con los logros de las escuelas. Tres aspectos relevantes de la filosofía adventista de la educación: el tener profesores adventistas, que se desarrolle habilidades para la predicación y que el estudiante testifique de su fe a otros, parecen estar perdiendo relevancia en las expectativas de los participantes en el estudio."
10.1155/2013/758729,Yoneda Philosophy in Engineering,"Mathematical models, such as sets of equations, are used in engineering to represent and analyze the behaviour of physical systems. The conventional notations in formulating engineering models do not clearly provide all the details required in order to fully understand the equations, and, thus, artifacts such as ontologies, which are the building blocks of knowledge representation models, are used to fulfil this gap. Since ontologies are the outcome of an intersubjective agreement among a group of individuals about the same fragment of the objective world, their development and use are questions in debate with regard to their competencies and limitations to univocally conceptualize a domain of interest. This is related to the following question: “What is the criterion for delimiting the specification of the main identifiable entities in order to consistently build the conceptual framework of the domain in question?” This query motivates us to view the Yoneda philosophy as a fundamental concern of understanding the conceptualization phase of each ontology engineering methodology. In this way, we exploit the link between the notion of formal concepts of formal concept analysis and a concluding remark resulting from the Yoneda embedding lemma of category theory in order to establish a formal process."
10.25078/ijhsrs.v2i1.517,Materialization And Humanization Of The Spirit: A Contextualization Based On The Stylistic Representation  Of The Balinese Hindu Modern Philosophy,"&lt;p&gt;The prominent characteristic of the pre-modern and modern philosophical discourse in the archipelago is generalized to that of the spiritualism with the saivistic discourse; including a Balinese modern philosophical text entitled &lt;em&gt;Aji Sangkya&lt;/em&gt;. However, the title of the text shows diachronic relationship with the &lt;em&gt;Samkhya Dharsana&lt;/em&gt; the so-called Indian (Hindu) materialism with its jargon ‘evolution’. The tension between the discourse of spiritualism and materialism in the text is the main concern of the article based on its stylistic representations. The contextual stylistics and the deconstruction approach provide great opportunities to the &lt;em&gt;Aji Sangkya&lt;/em&gt; to be interpreted as well as contextualized. Having elaborated the data, it is found that the text&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;implies the process of materialization of the spirit &lt;em&gt;(purusha&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;atman&lt;/em&gt;) into the circle of material &lt;em&gt;(pradhana)&lt;/em&gt;, until finally becoming material itself. Nonetheless, this materialization cannot merely be understood as the process with the ultimate goal of materialism, but implicitly of humanization since the human &lt;em&gt;(manusa)&lt;/em&gt; comes as the ultimate accumulation of all the philosophical categories. The term related to the materialization must be taken as the process of humanization or making the spirit humanized; the humanism take the middle position between the spiritualism and the materialism in &lt;em&gt;Aji Sangkya&lt;/em&gt;, the so-called Balinese Hindu modern text of philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;"
10.30649/htlj.v1i2.23,THE SENSE OF GENDER EQUALITY IN PAPUANS’ PHILOSOPHY,"&lt;p&gt;The construct of gender in social life manifests onto its discrimination in every aspect of society. Women have   a weak position and thus, become a “weapon” to weaken their own development in this growing emancipation era. Some legal efforts and the theory of feminist have developed to advocate them to grow up and get involved in various aspects of development; at least, it may suppress the level of discrimination toward women. Implementing the theory of feminism, however, should understand and see through some values that exist in society, as in Papuan women’s life. In the context of kinship, it may tie and harmonize the family bond. Therefore, the theory of feminism can be well implemented and accepted in a society which is full of togetherness, kinship, relatives, and love values.&lt;/p&gt;"
10.4018/jwp.2010100103,The Philosophy of Software Architecture,"Computer Software Intensive systems have become ingrained in our daily life. Apart from obvious scientific and business applications, various embedded devices are empowered with computer software. Such a diverse application of Computer Software has led to inherent complexity in building such systems. As civilizations moved forward, the concept of architectural thinking and practice was introduced to grapple with the complexity and other challenges of creating buildings, skyscrapers, townships, and cities. The Practice of Software Architecture is an attempt to understand and handle similar challenges in Software Intensive Systems. This paper introduces software architecture and the underlying philosophy thereof. This paper provokes a discussion around the present and future of Software Architecture. The authors discuss skills and roles of Software Architect."
10.1017/jie.2015.26,Mobile Devices for Tertiary Study – Philosophy Meets Pragmatics for Remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women,"This paper outlines PhD research which suggests mobile learning fits the cultural philosophies and roles of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who are preservice teachers in the very remote Australian communities where the research was conducted. The problem which the research addresses is the low completion rates for two community-based Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programs in South Australia (SA) and Queensland (Qld). Over the past decade, the national completion rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in teacher training was 36 per cent, and in these two community-based programs it was less than 15 per cent. This paper identifies the perceptions of the benefits of using mobile devices by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who are preservice teachers in very remote communities. They report ways in which mobile learning supports their complex roles and provides pragmatic positive outcomes for their tertiary study in remote locations. The paper describes the apparent alignment between mobile learning and cosmology, ontology, epistemology and axiology, which may underpin both the popularity of mobile devices and the affordances of mobile learning."
10.4018/ijossp.2012100105,Free Software Philosophy and Open Source,"This article introduces and explains some of the most relevant features of the free software philosophy formulated by Richard M. Stallman in the 1980s. The free software philosophy and the free software movement built on it historically preceded the open source movement by a decade and provided some of the key technological, legal and ideological foundations of the open source movement. Thus, in order to study the ideology of open source and its differences with regard to other modes of software production, it is important to understand the reasoning and the presuppositions included in Stallman’s free software philosophy."
10.4018/jcrmm.2013010101,Investigation of the Philosophy Practised in Green and Lean Manufacturing Management,"Green manufacturing management has attracted research attention in the recent past. In this paper, an attempt is made to review the status of literature and philosophy practised in Green manufacturing management. A number of articles and refereed journals are reviewed and classified into the types of the industry, with the focus on automotive industry. Knowledge, understanding and culture of green manufacturing philosophy within this focused industry community are captured, in order to develop the theoretical framework and design for Green manufacturing management."
10.4018/jte.2013010105,A Paradox Between Technological Autonomy and Ethical Heteronomy of Philosophy of Technology,"With entering postmodern techne time since 1960s, society has experienced technical turn in 1985. After the emergence in 1877, philosophy of technology has undergone engineering ethics turn in 1970s and empirical turn in 1980s. A paradox (technoethics)(TE) highlights between technological autonomy (TA) and ethics heteronomy (EH) from philosophy of technology. Traced with the underlined reasons and responsibility party, social control system for TE need set up a set of social control principles (respect TA, enhance EH, minimize risk and maximize perfection via responsibility, imagine diversification via uplifting) and social control strategies (technical control mechanism, technical ethical education, technical law mechanism) among technicians, engineers, philosophers of technology, and technical users etc. Then, techne can develop towards rational perfection, under the reflection and supervising from ethics of philosophy of technology and law."
10.31234/osf.io/sxdah,Estimating the Reproducibility of Experimental Philosophy,"For scientific theories grounded in empirical data, replicability is a core principle, for at least two reasons. First, unless we accept to have scientific theories rest on the authority of a small number of researchers, empirical studies should be replicable, in the sense that its methods and procedure should be detailed enough for someone else to conduct the same study. Second, for empirical results to provide a solid foundation for scientific theorizing, they should also be replicable, in the sense that most attempts at replicating the original study that produced them would yield similar results. The XPhi Replicability Project is primarily concerned with replicability in the second sense, that is: the replicability of results.  In the past year, several projects have shed doubt on the replicability of key findings in psychology, and most notably social psychology. Because the methods of experimental philosophy have often been close to the ones used in social psychology, it is only natural to wonder to which extent the results experimental philosophers ground their theory are replicable. The aim of the XPhi Replicability Project is precisely to reach a reliable estimate of the replicability of empirical results in experimental philosophy.  To this end, several research teams across the world will replicate around 40 studies in experimental philosophy, some among the most cited, others drawn at random. The results of the project will be published in a special issue of the Review of Philosophy and Psychology dedicated to the topic of replicability in cognitive science.The official website of the project can be found here :https://sites.google.com/site/thexphireplicabilityproject/homeThe project can also be followed on social medias:https://twitter.com/XPhiReplicationhttps://www.facebook.com/XPhiReplicabilityProject/"
10.4018/ijsodit.2012070102,Wired for Warmth,"An aspect of the relationship between philosophy and computer engineering is considered, with particular emphasis upon the design of artificial moral agents. Top-down vs. bottom-up approaches to ethical behavior are discussed, followed by an overview of some of the ways in which traditional ethics has informed robotics. Two macro-trends are then identified, one involving the evolution of moral consciousness in man and machine, the other involving the fading away of the boundary between the real and the virtual."
10.4018/ijacdt.2016010101,Where the Interaction Is Not,"The concept of interaction is foundational in technology interface design with its presuppositions being taken for granted. But the interaction metaphor has become ambiguous to the extent that its application to interface design contributes to misalignments between people's expected and actual experience with computers. This article re-examines the presuppositions governing human-computer interaction with the motivation of strengthening weaknesses in their foundational concepts. It argues for abandoning the interaction metaphor to refocus design discourse toward the mediation roles of technology interfaces. ‘Remediation', i.e. representation of one medium in another, is proposed as a conceptual model that more precisely describes the human-to-computer actions."
10.4018/978-1-59140-485-9.ch002,Critical Issues for Educators and Trainers,"In our last chapter, we explored the competencies and best practices needed to be successful in distance education. This chapter will continue to lay this foundation with a discussion of critical issues for educators and trainers. One of the first things to consider when creating or taking a new course at a distance is your own philosophy of education. Reviewing research studies can help educators, trainers, and learners understand the applications and practices that work in this setting. The concept of distance education as an innovation and the impact of technology in a global society are important as we consider the audience, access, and impact of distance education. Questions to guide your thoughts for this chapter are: What is the “no significant difference phenomenon” and how does research provide the theory to help guide the design, delivery, and evaluation of distance learning programs?"
10.4018/978-1-59140-556-6.ch080,"Social Philosophy, Communities, and the Epistemic Shifts","It is critical to distinguish between mainstream traditional management theory and the myriad of complementary approaches that have contributed to the development of alternative approaches to organisational and management theory. The dominant stream of management theory is still largely influenced by the command and control paradigm developed over a century ago by early theorists such as Weber, Taylor, and Fayol. Though the control paradigm today is closely connected to a technocratic and functionalistic perspective of management science, there is a growing awareness of the dangers of assuming a reductive and limited view of organisational complexity. In other words, it is important to recognise the role of bureaucratic, functional, and procedural-like aspects of organisational life, though it is critical to complement these perspectives with richer and more human-centred interpretations of organisational reality. This critical role is performed by, among others, communities of practice theory (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1999; Wenger, McDermott &amp; Snyder, 2002; Brown &amp; Duguid, 1991). In order to better understand the developments in terms of management thinking, it is relevant to revise the sequence of the different schools of thought that influenced the social sciences throughout the 20th century.

10.4018/978-1-59904-786-7.ch003,Gendered Philosophy of Science,"This chapter explores the ways in which the dualistic notion of gender is at the core of many fundamental ideas in the philosophy of science. The ways in which we have learned to perceive, think about, teach/learn, and conduct research in science and IT are deeply informed by a dualistic, gendered framework: science is associated with maleness, and nature with femaleness. This primary split supports a philosophy of science that envisions “good science” as purely rational and objective (male), devoid of emotion and subjectivity (female). These core values of a dominator society contribute to a climate that is not likely to be hospitable to those who are gender-socialized as women. In the end, I call for a new perspective on our philosophy of science and technology that embodies partnership values and ask: How might we proceed to reexamine our assumptions about science and technology to make the shift from a dominator to a partnership perspective? These ideas are explored in the following sections: (1) science is male; nature is female; (2) the myth of objectivity; (3) there’s no crying in science; and (4) envisioning a partnership philosophy of science (democratizing science and technology, redefining what makes good science, and examples of partnership science and IT).

10.4018/978-1-60566-784-3.ch001,Reflections Concerning Technology,"The philosophy of technology underlies how people view and use technology. The historic relationship of humans to technology is important to explore when developing a context for current technology applications. Within such a context, this chapter outlines the core components, philosophy and debate contributing to sessions run with early childhood education student teachers and early childhood educators."
10.22329/il.v17i2.2406,"TArgument is War...and War is Hell: Philosophy, Education, and Metaphors for Argumentation","The claim that argumentation has no proper role in either philosophy or education, and especially not in philosophical education, flies in the face of both conventional wisdom and traditional pedagogy. There is, however, something to be said for it because it is really only provocative against a certain philosophical backdrop. Our understanding of the concept ""argument"" is both reflected by and molded by the specific  metaphor that argument-is-war, something with winners and losers, offensive and defensive moments, and an essentially adversarial structure. Such arguments may be suitable for teaching a philosophy, but not for teaching philosophy. Surely, education and philosophy do not need to be conceived as having an adversarial essence-if indeed they are thought to have any essence at all. Accordingly, philosophy and education need more pragmatic goals than even Pierce's idealized notion of truth as the end of inquiry, e.g., the simple furtherance of inquiry. For this, new metaphors for framing and understanding the concept of argumentation are needed, and some suggestions in that direction will be considered."
10.4018/978-1-61520-795-4.ch004,"Philosophy, Personality and Property","What is a body, a matter of law? (Rao, 2007; Scott, 1981). Where is the body? Is it integral or severable from the legal person? Is it a commodity? Have our bodies, our selves, and our labour become commodities with a market exchange value? (Radin, 1996). The bioscientific conversion of the body into information has become labelled postmodern. Jean Baudrillard described this postmodernity as ‘hyperreality’. (Poster, 1999). This means that only the viewer only acknowledges the real in its image – reality, as the hyperreal, is “always already reproduced”. (Id.). The process of conversion of the body, the human organism, into genetic information is just such a reproduction. Just as the process of conversion of the personality into reputational information is also such a reproduction. This means that the body need no longer exist only as a corporeal reality, but also as the ‘mirroring’ body, quite literally ‘a body of information.’ (Halewood, 2008)"
10.4018/978-1-61692-245-0.ch003,"Balancing Policies, Principles, and Philosophy in Information Assurance","Laws, codes, and rules are essential for any community and society, public or private, to operate in an orderly and productive manner. Without laws and codes, anarchy and chaos abound and the purpose and role of the organization is lost. However, there is a potential for serious long-term problems when individuals or organizations become so focused on rules, laws, and policies that basic principles are ignored. We discuss the purpose of laws, rules, and codes, how these can be helpful to, but not substitute for, an understanding of basic principles of ethics and integrity. We also examine how such an understanding can increase in the level of ethical and moral behavior without imposing increasingly detailed rules."

10.21603/2078-8975-2016-2-7-12,AVANT-GARDISM AND CAPITALISM IN THE MIRROR OF PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY,"The paper investigates the role of the avant-gardism in a capitalist society in the works of philosophers, especially M. A. Lifshitz and M. Cantor. The purpose of the paper is the comparison of the positions of these authors, to reveal their criticism of modernism historical and ideological component. The paper also addresses the problem of estrangement in the sphere of influence of culture in the reflection of the philosophical works of the 20th – early 21st centuries. Modern culture is the result of the degeneration of this estrangement, the cause of the alienation of labor. One of the manifestations of this degeneration has become the avant-garde, which has evolved from a ""non-threatening rebellion"" to the profitable business. The paper also addresses the problem of the correlation between fascism and avant-garde. Basic research methods in the paper are the historical-genetic and historical-comparative methods. Comparison of the critical positions of M. A. Lifshitz and M. Cantor shows that the main reason for the differences in their views is a different understanding of the world historical process. This difference reflects the ideological and social differences between the Soviet and post-Soviet humanitarian intelligentsia."

Modern transhumanists consider morphological freedom as a concept, revealing the natural right to happiness. The authors take this idea as a starting point and consider the logic of the convergent biotechnology development. They believe that the extension of natural law has the character of a dialectical strategy of assumptions and tactics of the local bans in the sphere of human reproduction. This situation is typical of biomedical technology in general. The legislator authorizes a technology by endorsing forms of reproductive relationships and blocking technologies that support immoral forms. As a result, it gradually enhances understanding of how technology must be applied to ensure the human natural rights. Convergence of technologies makes real a hypothetical design of rights to reproduction, while the conflict of morality and the imperatives of technological development can be resolved from the standpoint of the primacy of natural law.&lt;/p&gt;"
10.12955/cbup.v5.982,ON MORAL IDEAL BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION  IN THE GLOBALIZING CONTEXT,"Nowadays, humanity is continuously challenged by globalization at all levels: technological, economic, political, ecological, and social-cultural. The axiological crisis we face makes us find and develop viable values – by priority, ethical values - for the present time. More than ever, man needs to look for and to reconstruct his moral ideal by discovering new points of reference concerning the choices to be done. This paper focuses on the necessity of an ethical perspective open to principles rich in philosophy and religion. The purpose is to highlight the question of the moral ideal of human life in a globalizing context by accounting the offer of these two major cultural domains."
10.4018/978-1-61350-068-2.ch055,"People, Technology and Human Resource Development (HRD) Philosophy","Technology and people are present in all organizations. How they are managed and developed is essential to the competitive advantage of organizations. Understanding the dynamics of this relationship is an area that needs to be better understood within the Human Resource Development (HRD) field. This chapter will explore the extent that HRD philosophy addresses the relationship of people and technology. Comparing people and technology has been a debate since the industrial revolution occurred in America (Swanson, 1982; Swanson, &amp; Torraco, 1994). Man and machine are as essential to organizational prosperity as air and water is to living; yet, it is not often researched and published in HRD literature (Githens, Dirani, Gitonga, and Teng, 2008). Could this be why HRD professionals do not have a seat at the proverbial table in corporate America? Are HRD professionals and researchers denying that there is a relationship between people and technology in organizations? Are HRD professionals and researchers limited by their beliefs concerning the comparison of people to technology?"
10.4018/978-1-4666-1782-7.ch004,Towards The New Episteme,"The usual horizon of knowledge science is limited to nominalism, empiricism, and naturalistic and evolutionary epistemologies. I propose to broaden this horizon by applying some other philosophical attitudes, such as a non-nominalistic philosophy of language. A basic methodology for the new episteme, including (non-nominalistic) typology and a definition of knowledge and of tacit knowledge, is proposed. Several types of knowledge and the corresponding tacit knowledge are discussed within a broadened philosophical context. There are many types of knowledge and tacit knowledge using different methods of sharing. The main problem with the effective sharing of tacit knowledge is sharing knowledge relevant to the given problem. The transfer, change and transformation of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge are possible. An example of such a transition, which I call conceptualization, is described. Conceptualization exemplifies how new knowledge can be created with the use of tacit knowledge. A need also exists for a professional collaboration between knowledge science, knowledge management and philosophy."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199669356.001.0001,The Oxford Handbook of Process Philosophy and Organization Studies,"This book examines process philosophy in organization studies by focusing on the life and work of a specific philosopher such as Jacques Derrida, Zhuang Zi, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Wilhelm Dilthey, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, Gabriel Tarde, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Henri Bergson. It looks at process from five different aspects—temporality, wholeness, openness and the open self, force, and potentiality—that all touch on emerging concerns in organization studies. Each chapter considers how a philosopher’s work could potentially be useful for thinking processually in organization and management studies. Viewing process philosophy as a way of thinking rather than as a specific theory to be used, the book explores how philosophers might make us see things anew. For example, it discusses Daodejing, a compilation of sayings by Laozi, as well as Heraclitus’ philosophy and its inspirations for process thinking in organization studies.

I deal with three worries: the problem of double procession; the problem of the Father's omnipotence; worries about the Spirit's subordination. The model has two main commitments: (i) relations like proceeding, begetting, generation, etc. are causal relations; (ii) each Divine Person is caused by the other two Divine Persons. The model also allows for the Father's elevation over and above the Spirit and the Son. I end by discussing some problems for this revisionary scheme.1"

Programming applications do work more rapidly, efficiently, and accurately than humans, with supercomputers doing thermodynamic modeling, simulation of societies, and other large number-crunching projects. More recently, the supercomputer is taking on human brain functions, with increasing attention to actually replicating the human brain. Elsewhere in this book, the author has written about the philosophy underpinning these developments, but he now focuses on how computers communicate with us. The binary language computers use has an underpinning philosophy that may help explain at least one aspect of consciousness. When we probe deeply into the philosophy of bivalent systems, radical issues emerge that embrace the nature of our very being, such as completeness, certainty, process, the very nature of our universe, and possibly a consciousness pervading it.

10.4018/978-1-5225-1886-0.ch007,Philosophy and Management,"This chapter explores the Vedanta, an ancient Indian religious philosophy; and its relevance to management. Chinmayananda (2003) asserted that from time to time ancient philosophies like Vedanta needs intelligent re-interpretation to apply effectively in the context of modern times. Vedanta recommends a management approach, which focuses on exploring the inner world of the self. It begins with the manager's awareness and development of the self, as the greatness in any field is never achieved without tremendous self-realization and self-discipline (Avinashilingam, 1975). This chapter is based on a qualitative research methodology called hermeneutics, which involves the interpretation of ancient or classical literature and the content analysis of selected verses from the Vedanta (Vedic literatures) especially the Bhagavad-Gita. This chapter provides a framework to study the Indian management from a religious, philosophical and cultural perspective. This will be relevant to Indian managers and foreign managers managing in Indian context. "

Stallman in the 1980s. The free software philosophy and the free software movement built on it historically preceded the open source movement by a decade and provided some of the key technological, legal and ideological foundations of the open source movement. Thus, in order to study the ideology of open source and its differences with regard to other modes of software production, it is important to understand the reasoning and the presuppositions included in Stallman’s free software philosophy."
10.4018/978-1-60960-768-5.ch009,The Theory of Constraints,"In the late 1970s, a new approach to the management of operations was developed by Goldratt. Now known as the theory of constraints (TOC), it provides a coherent management theory for running an organisation. It has two major components: a philosophy which underpins the working principle of on-going improvement and a generic approach for investigating, analyzing, and creating solutions to problems, called the “thinking process” (TP). Several books, numerous articles, and a few journal special issues have been published on TOC. This chapter provides a comprehensive review of TOC concepts, philosophy, and working principles."
10.4018/978-1-4666-9948-9.ch007,A Teaching Philosophy,"This chapter examines the importance of an educator's “teaching philosophy” as a major prerequisite for Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in Teacher Education. The critical need for this examination is guided by the complex nature of challenges that educational institutions are continually faced with such as, diversity, students' awareness of their rights, ethnicity and negative ethnicity, information technology, capitalism and commodification of the educational enterprise, international competitiveness in both teaching and learning among others. Further, quality driven ESD programmes are currently a global concern. To guide this study were the following research questions: What is Sustainable Development/ (SD) and ESD? What is a teaching philosophy? What is the purpose of a teaching philosophy? What should inform an educator's teaching philosophy? In which ways can an educator implement his/her teaching philosophy? And, what characterizes a clear teaching philosophy? Finally, recommendations that can inform theory, policy and practice are presented. "

In this chapter, the authors reframe Scharmer's Theory U as an attempt to develop practical wisdom by applying certain European philosophical concepts. Specifically, they trace a genealogy of social sculpture, Schwungspiel, poetic creation, and spiritual science, and suggest that Scharmer's work integrates these concepts into a pragmatic pedagogy that has implications for business practice as well as business education.

10.4018/978-1-59904-970-0.ch030,Philosophy of Web-Based Mediation,"This chapter deals with the influence of mediation in different kinds of virtual environments, e.g. virtual conferences, e-learning platforms, distance learning environments and surroundings, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and various other user interfaces. Mediation is a means in which messages, discussion and behaviour are becoming more and more conceptual and abstract and have an effect on our social being. As a result of mediation there is no first-hand experience of reality, everything is constructed, and in virtual reality we have receded a long way off from real life. Mediation affects our capability to make independent ethical decisions. The same process is discerned in all the social and commercial practice where it is rationalized by processing techniques or when it is made virtual. Here mediation is studied from a phenomenological perspective. Quantification, modelling and regulation also describe aspects of mediation. This chapter is a review article and an opening in mediational ethics based on classical philosophy."

Human resource development (HRD) professionals are seeking ways to address rapid, continuous changes in technology and some, unfounded, fears and concerns regarding the influence of globalization on middle-class workers. Globalization efforts do not need to equal unemployment for American middle-class workers. Globalization can add opportunities for American middle-class workers to increase their job prospects by learning new skills, including how to leverage technological innovations for their advantage within the global job market. HRD professionals have an opportunity to assist workers with their skill development and improvement. "

This coherent model comprises a multidimensional collection of key guiding principles and criteria in system analysis, modeling, design, development, testing, deployment, operations, management, and governance. The systematic framework provides a multidisciplinary view of the design tenets, idioms, principles, and styles (TIPS) in the IT architecting practices for engineering process and quality assurance. There are 26 constituent elements defined in the scheme, the names of which form an array of A-Z using the first letter. The characteristics and applicability of all 26 dimensions in the PAD model are articulated in detail. Recommendations and future trends are also presented in the context. This overarching model has been extensively leveraged in one format or another to design a wide range of Web-based systems in various industry sectors."

10.4018/978-1-60566-026-4.ch131,Critical Realism as an Underlying Philosophy for IS Research,"Many recent articles from within the information systems (IS) arena present an old-fashioned view of realism. For example, Iivari, Hirschheim, and Klein (1998) saw classical realism as seeing “data as describing objective facts, information systems as consisting of technological structures (‘hardware’), human beings as subject to causal laws (determinism), and organizations as relatively stable structures” (p. 172). Wilson (1999) saw the realist perspective as relying on “the availability of a set of formal constraints which have the characteristics of abstractness, generality, invariance across contexts.” Fitzgerald and Howcroft (1998) presented a realist ontology as one of the foundational elements of positivism in discussing the polarity between hard and soft approaches in IS. Realism is placed alongside positivist, objectivist, etic epistemologies and quantitative, confirmatory, deductive, laboratory-focussed and nomothetic methodologies. Such a traditional view of realism is perhaps justified within the IS arena, as it reflects the historical focus of its use, however, there now needs to be a greater recognition of the newer forms of realism—forms of realism that specifically address all of the positivist leanings emphasised by Fitzgerald and Howcroft (1998). A particular example of this newer form of realism is critical realism. This modern realist approach is primarily founded on the writings of the social sciences philosopher Bhaskar (1978, 1979, 1986, 1989, 1991). The usefulness of such an approach has recently been recognized in the IS arena by Dobson (2001) and Mingers (2002). "
10.4018/978-1-4666-0336-3.ch013,The Philosophy of Software Architecture,"Computer Software Intensive systems have become ingrained in our daily life. Apart from obvious scientific and business applications, various embedded devices are empowered with computer software. Such a diverse application of Computer Software has led to inherent complexity in building such systems. As civilizations moved forward, the concept of architectural thinking and practice was introduced to grapple with the complexity and other challenges of creating buildings, skyscrapers, townships, and cities. The Practice of Software Architecture is an attempt to understand and handle similar challenges in Software Intensive Systems. This paper introduces software architecture and the underlying philosophy thereof. This paper provokes a discussion around the present and future of Software Architecture. The authors discuss skills and roles of Software Architect."
10.4018/978-1-4666-8130-9.ch005,Ethics is Not Enough,"This chapter argues for understanding engineering ethics in terms of three principles—but then going beyond ethics to political theory. A simplified prefatory comparison between engineering and science points to the importance of ethics in engineering. Section 1 provides a historico-philosophical overview of engineering ethics in the United States, on the premise that American experience can be generally illuminating. The narrative traces a trajectory of commitments from company loyalty to public responsibility, with the public responsibility promoting public engagement. Section 2 considers three influential American cases that together suggest a duty to public disclosure. Section 3 broadens the analysis through selective reviews of engineering ethics profiles in Germany, The Netherlands, Japan, Chile, and in transnational professional engineering organizations, on the basis of which is articulated a duty not only to avoid harm but also to do good. Section 4, a critical reflection on engineering in the intensive form of research and design, posits a synthesis of the principles of participation, disclosure, and beneficence into a duty plus respicare, to take more into account. A concluding section nevertheless suggests the inadequacy of limiting engineering ethics to ethics. Ethics in engineering like ethics generally implicates political theory. Ethics in the absence of politics demands unrealistic personal heroism; political theory without any foundation in ethics promotes tyranny. "
10.4018/978-1-4666-9675-4.ch007,Military vs. Citizens in the Arab Zone,"All the political systems of the Arab-Islamic zone are authoritarian, with the exception of Tunisia where fair elections recently took place and political alternation was accepted. Lebanon is another exception in the sense that state prerogatives – shared between antagonist religious communities – do not enjoy sufficient power to exert coercive policies. But apart from these two cases, this global authoritarian environment is of no avail vis-à-vis any initiative that would aim at forging some idea of citizenship – with its obligations and privileges – amongst the population, and particularly among the military. The present analysis will concentrate on the links existing between authoritarianism and citizenship, with an emphasis on Arab armed forces considered within their sociological contexts, since these entities are as much the emanation of the people(s) as the physical manifestation of the regimes' strength. The issue will be addressed through two perspectives: politics and philosophy. "
10.4018/978-1-5225-2443-4.ch004,Aristotle's “Logical Worldview”,"The author presents the idea of a “logical worldview” – an approach to understanding logic by examining philosophical positions in metaphysics, epistemology, and theories of cognition and perception, and exploring how philosophical and logical positions combine to form a complete logical system. Aristotle's logical worldview is examined in some detail, and the logical systems of Francis Bacon and George Boole are examined by exploring how a new logic results when certain Aristotelian philosophical positions are abandoned. The logical worldview approach is also shown to help explain certain puzzles with Aristotle's logic, such as existential import, the form of the syllogism, and Aristotle's “missing” moods and figures from the list of valid moods.

10.4018/978-1-5225-2443-4.ch003,The Philosophy of African Logic,"The chapter aims to do two things: 1) a rigorous presentation of philosophy of African logic and 2) to do this from the perspective of Ezumezu (an African) logic. The chapter will proceed by defining the three aspects of Ezumezu logic namely: 1) as a formal system, 2) as methodology, and 3) as a philosophy of African logic. My inquiry in this work primarily is with the philosophy of African logic but it will also cut across formal logic and methodology in addition. In the first section, I will attempt to show how the cultural influence behind the formulation of the principles of African logic justifies such a system as relative on the one hand, and how the cross-cultural applications justify it as universal on the other. I believe that this is where African philosophical assessment of African logic ought to begin because most critics of the idea of African logic agitate that an African system of logic, if it is ever possible, must necessarily lack the tincture of universal applicability. Afterwards, I will narrow my inquiry down to the African philosophy appraisal of African logic with an example of Ezumezu system. This focus is especially critical because it purveys a demonstration of a prototype system of an African logic. In the section on some principles of Ezumezu logic, I will attempt to accomplish the set goal of this chapter by presenting and discussing some principles of Ezumezu logic which I had formulated in earlier works in addition to formulating a few additional ones. The interesting thing to note here is that these principles are/will all (be) articulated from the African background ontology. I will conclude by throwing further light on the merits, nature and promises of an African logic tradition. "
10.4018/978-1-59904-933-5.ch259,"Social Philosophy, Communities, and the Epistemic Shifts","It is critical to distinguish between mainstream traditional management theory and the myriad of complementary approaches that have contributed to the development of alternative approaches to organisational and management theory. The dominant stream of management theory is still largely influenced by the command and control paradigm developed over a century ago by early theorists such as Weber, Taylor, and Fayol. Though the control paradigm today is closely connected to a technocratic and functionalistic perspective of management science, there is a growing awareness of the dangers of assuming a reductive and limited view of organisational complexity. In other words, it is important to recognise the role of bureaucratic, functional, and procedural-like aspects of organisational life, though it is critical to complement these perspectives with richer and more human-centred interpretations of organisational reality. This critical role is performed by, among others, communities of practice theory (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1999; Wenger, McDermott &amp; Snyder, 2002; Brown &amp; Duguid, 1991). In order to better understand the developments in terms of management thinking, it is relevant to revise the sequence of the different schools of thought that influenced the social sciences throughout the 20th century.

This can be related to opportunities as well as scope for consumer proficiency. Initial years of this decade have found that over dependence on innovation has made it consistent, compulsive and converging. With this impetuous innovation, certain aspect of critical thought process brings technology to the spot-light. Marketing philosophy that recognizes technology as the rationale of foundation of globalization and innovation must retrospect and further critically assess that how far technology has dissociated both the terms. Globalization by nature has been divergent, yet struggling to ensure marketing success because innovation is converging with the help of technology. Global Marketing is in a precarious juncture where every alternate day new technology is wiping out the old and with this new market is superimposing the old one. This transition is threatening concepts like segmentation, targeting and branding. This chapter is a critical assessment of role of technology in redefining the relationship between globalization, innovation and marketing. Secondary data of 51 Indian business sectors, consisting some of the leading market players have been analyzed to explore the relationship and propose a conceptual model. "
10.31234/osf.io/p7ube,P-curving x-phi: Does experimental philosophy have evidential value?,"In this article, we analyze the evidential value of the corpus of experimental philosophy (x-phi). While proponents of x-phi claim that its studies provide insight into philosophical problems, some philosophers and psychologists have expressed concerns that the findings from these studies lack evidential value. One reason for this could be selection bias (i.e., the selective publication of significant results) and p-hacking, where ‘p-hacking’ refers to the research practices that increase the odds of obtaining a p-value below the significance level. To find out whether the significant findings reported in x-phi papers result from selection bias or p-hacking, we applied a p-curve analysis to a corpus of 365 x-phi chapters and articles. Our results suggest that this corpus has evidential value, although there are hints of p-hacking in a few parts of the x-phi corpus."

By comparing Orwell's essay and novel, as well as explaining their connection to the Whorfian theory of Linguistic Relativity, the author hopes to track the development of Nineteen Eighty-Four's Newspeak as the ultimate language of control in a fictionalized world which seemed all too possible to its author.

More detailed explanation and discussion of specific points of his philosophy will be offered where they are first needed in later chapters, where these basic themes will be used to formulate frameworks for understanding research and practice in several areas of IS.

It covers Dooyeweerd’s theory of modal spheres (aspects), his theory of things, his theory of knowing, experience and assumptions, and, on the basis of these, it draws together his approach to everyday life. What it does not cover is his notion of cosmic time and the relationship between the self and the Divine, nor his extensive discussion of the State. It also reviews some criticisms of Dooyeweerd."

10.5840/beq200414329,The Philosophy and Rhetoric of Auditor Independence Concepts,"Abstract:
            This paper analyzes the rhetoric surrounding the profession’s presentations of auditor independence. We trace the evolution of the character of the auditor from Professional Man in the early years of the twentieth century to the more public and abstract figures of Judicial Man and Economic Man. The changing character of the auditor in the profession’s narratives of legitimation reflects changes in the role of auditing, in the economic environment, and in the values of American society. Economic man is a self-interested and shallow character who offered the auditing profession little protection against involvement in corporate scandals. In the wake of recent accounting scandals, the profession is calling for a return to the character of Professional Man to restore trust in audits and the financial markets.
            We also analyze the philosophical bases of the metaphors surrounding auditor independence. These metaphors, particularly the metaphor of independence as separation, create problems in conceptualizing independence concepts. How can you discuss appropriate relationships when your basic concept is one of separation, or no relationship? On the other hand, relational concepts of independence are also flawed if they are not based on a firm moral foundation. We suggest how the profession can act to rebuild its moral foundation through recognition of collective responsibility."

How they are managed and developed is essential to the competitive advantage of organizations. Understanding the dynamics of this relationship is an area that needs to be better understood within the Human Resource Development (HRD) field. This chapter will explore the extent that HRD philosophy addresses the relationship of people and technology. Comparing people and technology has been a debate since the industrial revolution occurred in America (Swanson, 1982; Swanson, &amp; Torraco, 1994). Man and machine are as essential to organizational prosperity as air and water is to living; yet, it is not often researched and published in HRD literature (Githens, Dirani, Gitonga, and Teng, 2008). Could this be why HRD professionals do not have a seat at the proverbial table in corporate America? Are HRD professionals and researchers denying that there is a relationship between people and technology in organizations? Are HRD professionals and researchers limited by their beliefs concerning the comparison of people to technology?"

But the interaction metaphor has become ambiguous to the extent that its application to interface design contributes to misalignments between peoples' expected and actual experience with computer-enhanced actions. This chapter re-examines the presuppositions governing human-computer interaction with the motivation of strengthening weaknesses in their foundational concepts, and contributing a theoretical framework to designing for artistic as well as mundane experience. It argues for abandoning the interaction metaphor to refocus design discourse toward the intermediation and mediation roles of technology interfaces. Remediation (i.e., representation of one medium in another) is proposed as a conceptual model that more precisely describes the human-to-computer actions. "

Religious literature never existed in a certain conceptual unity in the understanding of the sources of Christian religiosity. Somewhere they fluctuate in one direction or another, depending on the ideological position of the researcher and his own attitude towards this religion. However, according to some distinguishing features, certain hypothetical points of view on the origin of Christianity are reduced to the characteristic two. The first one is the beginning of its emergence with Judaism, and considers Christianity to be a logical continuation and, so to speak, a successor, albeit largely different from him. The second - deduces the origin of Christianity from the sphere of Greek idealist thought as such, which served the generative cause of its foundation."

The proposed article is intended to emphasize this content of ""philosophical"" philosophy, expressed in a theological form, and to show that ""proof of the existence of God"" in the language of philosophy means certain logical arguments that, if properly processed, could constitute a philosophical speculative method."

10.4018/978-1-61520-745-9.ch004,A Productive Decade of Andragogy’s History and Philosophy,"With the foundation of andragogy having been laid, there was a serious attempt at investigating its value. Some felt that a broad scope was established in the practice to support growth in learners, with any mention of adult learning needing to include andragogy. Others perceived that andragogy produced unproductive debates along a binary path, with its being too caught up in individualization, the politics of exclusion, conformity, and de-contextualizing adult learning. However, some research revealed numerous dimensions of andragogy. The connection with distance learning became very strong and solid. New applications of andragogy were spawned into foreign language learning, internet learning, validation of the adult instructor’s perspective, the public school, emotional intelligence, and an interlinking with brain research. The long range projection of andragogy saw a strong resurgence in numerous research papers being put forward through conferences and publications with the world-wide foundation being established thorough documentation of the materials. Savicevic looks far into the future and credits Knowles with a meritorious place in the advancement of andragogy. Many new applications over an extensive period of time were increasing."
10.5922/0207-6918-2018-2-2,Kantian Philosophy and ‘Linguistic Kantianism’,"The expression “linguistic Kantianism” is widely used to refer to ideas about thought and cognition being determined by language — a conception characteristic of 20th century analytic philosophy. In this article, I conduct a comparative analysis of Kant’s philosophy and views falling under the umbrella expression “linguistic Kantianism.” First, I show that “linguistic Kantianism” usually presupposes a relativistic conception that is alien to Kant’s philosophy (although Kant’s philosophy itself may be perceived as relativistic from a certain point of view). Second, I analyse Kant’s treatment of linguistic determinism and the place of his ideas in the 18th century intellectual milieu and provide an overview of relevant contemporary literature. Third, I show that authentic Kantianism and “linguistic Kantianism” belong to two different types of transcendentalism, to which I respectively refer as the “transcendentalism of the subject” and the “transcendentalism of the medium.” The transcendentalism of the subject assigns a central role to the faculties of the cognising subject (according to Kant, cognition is not the conforming of a subject’s intuitions and understanding to objects, but rather the application of a subject’s cognitive faculties to them). The transcendentalism of the medium assigns the role of an “active” element neither to the external world nor to the faculties of the cognising subject, but to something in between — language, in the case of “linguistic Kantianism.” I conclude that the expression “linguistic Kantianism” can be misleading when it comes to the origins of this theory. It would be more appropriate to refer to this theory by the expression “linguistic transcendentalism,” thus avoiding an incorrect reference to Kant."
10.5922/0207-6918-2018-2-3,Legal Consciousness at the Early Stage of Personality Development from the Perspective of Russian Neo-Kantian Philosophy of Pedagogy,"In this study, I investigate the philosophico-pedagogical concepts developed by German and Russian Neo-Kantians, namely P. Natorp, S. I. Hessen, M. M. Rubinstein. In order to identify the peculiarities of the approaches of the Neo-Kantians to legal consciousness in children, I show that the widely accepted view that Hessen borrowed Natorp’s hierarchical triad of moral development — anomie, heteronomy, and autonomy — lacks a solid ground. Moreover, Natorp generally does not use the concept of anomie to characterise the state of morality and legal consciousness during early childhood, and Rubinstein’s position on this issue is closer to the position of Natorp than to that of Hessen. Furthermore, I examine the differences in the views of the Russian Neo-Kantians on play as an activity crucial for the understanding of human childhood. According to Hessen, play is anomic, whereas Rubinstein sees it as a collaborative activity that can engender respect for other people and their rights, i.e., to legal consciousness. In conclusion, I address Hessen’s and Rubinstein’s understandings of the phenomena of law and legal consciousness, which determined their definitions of legal consciousness in children. Unlike Hessen, who insists that anomie is innate in early childhood, since children of that age are unfamiliar with ethical categories, Rubinstein introduces the concept of “legal psychology,” which contains the germs of legal consciousness."

Taj težak problem baca u sjenu stanje prezaposlenog čovjeka. Prezauzetost stoji naspram nedostatka okupacije i izaziva veliko nezadovoljstvo, strah, umor, osjećaje besmisla i bezizlaznosti. U nemogućnosti da sam odlučuje što će okupirati njegov život i vrijeme čovjek ima osjećaj da ih gubi, da mu oni izmiču, kao i identitet koji poistovjećuje

U svijetu je posljednjih godina zabilježen trend po kojem je čovjek na radnom mjestu radnik, a u slobodno vrijeme postaje filozofom dok je filozof tijekom tjedna prezaposleni radnik, a vikendom težak. Drugim riječima, filozofi napuštaju ekskluzivnost i akademske krugove da bi rješavali probleme svakodnevnice. Može li filozofija poslužiti kao terapija (L. Marinoff,

10.31337/oz.71.3.1,"Some Aspects of Doubt in Descartes’ ""Meditations on the First Philosophy""","In his treatise Meditations on the First Philosophy, Descartes seeks to clear the path to truth by means of doubt which extends from partial doubt, affecting the credibility of certain insights, to queries about man’s (in)capacity for reasoning as such. It pursues the ultimate limits of that which can be sensed, experienced, thought or imagined
(res) and ends with the subject itself. The endeavor to pursue doubt to its limits involves the evil genius, the deceiver who, as a possibility, emerges with such inverted reasoning as to oppose notions about the goodness of God, of an omnipotent Creator
who is the wellspring of truth, and which (inverted reasoning) is representative of the power of free will. It is possible to regard Descartes’ universal doubt as a reduction to nothing, »reductio ad nihilum«. Still, doubt of this kind presupposes actual existence
(res existens); similarly, thoughts on creation are contained in thoughts on God and the evil genius and later are revealed in the idea of God. The objects of doubt are thus outlined, and finally doubt resolves subjectively, through »I«, to confront the very powerful
and very cunning deceiver. In doing so and by looking back, »I« in its existence becomes aware of the truth of its origin. In this article we will attempt, by analyzing Descartes’ texts, to resolve whether the assumption of the deceiver contains within it assumptions as well and the nature thereof; also, who is the evil genius for Descartes,
why does he need him, what is the reason for including him in his reflections, and finally, in what way do dreaming and madness relate to doubt?"
10.31337/oz.71.3.4,Laying the Groundwork for a »New Ontology« in the Philosophy of Nicolai Hartmann as a Criticism of Non–Integral Philosophical Systems,"The aim of this paper is to study the significance of Nicolai Hartmann’s contribution to ontology and, furthermore, to point out the consequences of his laying the groundwork for a »new ontology« which fact may be interpreted as a direct criticism of certain exceptionally well–represented philosophical perspectives up until his time; also, however, of new trends which escalated in philosophical circles in the period of Hartmann’s creative productivity. We encounter in Hartmann’s work »New Ways of Ontology« an explanation of the real world derived from layers and categories of
being. To his way of thinking, the errors of many of the contemporary philosophical approaches consist in giving preference to one layer of the real world at the expense of others, which results in the development of a reductionist perspective; furthermore,
it can cause teleology to evolve into a closed system, something advocated by those who give preference to the highest, that is, the spiritual layer. One consequence of the cited conflicting views is a disagreement regarding the issue of what renders a philosophical
perspective acceptable, and so the dispute ensues as to whether acceptance of a philosophical system requires that the criteria of relevance and exactness prevail. Since discord arises indirectly from giving preference to one layer with respect to other layers of the real world, both perspectives appear to be erroneous."

According to this solution the three fundamental characteristics of every human state of consciousness – that is, having a content and being conscious and self-conscious - are identified with three higher order properties of brain dynamics from an ontological point of view, although each of them can be described and explained in the language of neuroscience, cognitive psychology and folk-psychology.]"

This paper explores how and to what extent Stoic virtue ethics and critical Freirean ecopedagogies can advance the UN’s vision for progressive educational systems with transformative societal effects. We propose an integrated solution that provides ecopedagogical concepts a more robust philosophical foundation whilst also offering Stoicism additional tools to tackle 21st-century problems, such as climate change and environmental degradation. The result of the paper is the preliminary theoretical underpinnings of an educational framework that encompasses planetary-level concerns and offers a fuller expression of the terms “sustainable development” and “global citizen”."
10.3390/rel9110374,The Four–Seven Debate of Korean Neo-Confucianism and the Moral Psychological and Theistic Turn in Korean Philosophy,"This paper discusses how Korean Neo-Confucian philosophers in the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910) explained the moral nature of the mind and its emotions. Among the philosophical debates of Korean Neo-Confucianism, the author of the paper focuses on the Four–Seven Debate (a philosophical debate about the moral psychological nature of the four moral emotions and the seven morally indiscrete emotions) to analyze its li–qi metaphysics (a philosophical explanation of the universe through the intricate and interactive relation between the two cosmic processes, li and qi) and its conflicting viewpoints on the moral psychological nature of emotion. Because of the ambiguities and inconsistencies in the Neo-Confucian explanation, specifically those of the Cheng–Zhu schools of Neo-Confucianism on the nature and functions of the mind, Korean Neo-Confucians struggled to bring Neo-Confucian li–qi metaphysics to the moral and practical issues of the human mind and moral cultivation. Later in the Joseon dynasty, some Korean Neo-Confucians discussed the fundamental limitations of li–qi metaphysics and developed their explanations for the goodness of the moral mind and the world from an alternative (i.e., theistic) viewpoint."
10.3390/philosophies3040037,Addressing the Conceptual Controversy of Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture: A Combined Perspective from Environmental Philosophy and Agri-Environmental Sciences,"During the last 20 years, agronomists, environmentalists and related researchers have conveyed the need of producing enough food to satisfy the growing population demand, with minimum environmental footprint. Under this framework, the need for a “sustainable intensification” (SI) of agriculture has arisen, being a concept deeply contested the last several years. We aim to shed some light on the matter from the point of view of both environmental philosophy and agri-environmental sciences. We found that the lack of clarity exposes the conceptual limits of SI, since its attributions are far from being extrapolated, for example, to animal production. Agricultural science should ensure that stakeholders understand the facts and implications of SI before implementing them. In addition, if understood only as either a set of practices or a sort of panacea, SI will be closer to fail for stakeholders’ expectations. Then, a key concern we have highlighted is one which should compel agri-environmental scientists and environmental philosophers alike to hold such conceptual frameworks accountable. Ensuring communities and public actors make informed choices about food security requires that shared goals between our disciplines are enacted in research, with community well-being as a core consideration of any debate regarding sustainability."
10.3390/philosophies3040038,Philosophia Naturalis Rediviva: Natural Philosophy for the Twenty-First Century,"A revitalized practice of natural philosophy can help people to live a better life and promote a flourishing ecosystem. Such a philosophy is natural in two senses. First, it is natural by seeking to understand the whole of nature, including mental phenomena. Thus, a comprehensive natural philosophy should address the phenomena of sentience by embracing first- and second-person methods of investigation. Moreover, to expand our understanding of the world, natural philosophy should embrace a full panoply of explanations, similar to Aristotle’s four causes. Second, such a philosophy is natural by being grounded in human nature, taking full account of human capacities and limitations. Future natural philosophers should also make use of all human capacities, including emotion and intuition, as well as reason and perception, to investigate nature. Finally, since the majority of our brain’s activities are unconscious, natural philosophy should explore the unconscious mind with the aim of deepening our relation with the rest of nature and of enhancing well-being."

10.1071/ea02213,"The Sustainable Grazing Systems Pasture Model: description, philosophy and application to the SGS National Experiment","A biophysical simulation model (the Sustainable Grazing Systems Pasture Model) was developed as an integral part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems National Experiment. It was developed to meet the needs of the researchers both for analysing data and processes at individual sites, and for simulating the outcome of these processes operating in generic pasture systems on a range of soil types, under specific grazing managements. The model was designed to reside on the desktops of individual researchers and for those researchers to be part of its development process.The Sustainable Grazing Systems Pasture Model incorporates the following: a physiological model of pasture species herbage accumulation in response to climatic conditions; the water balance including evapotranspiration, runoff (surface and subsurface), infiltration and drainage; pasture utilisation by grazing animals; a metabolisable energy-based animal growth model; and organic matter and inorganic nutrient dynamics (for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and sulfur) including plant uptake, adsorption, leaching, nitrogen fixation by legumes, and atmospheric nitrogen losses. A range of grazing options (set-stocking, rotational grazing and continuous grazing at a variable rate) is available for ewes and lambs, and wethers. Each of the main modules (water, nutrients, pastures and animals) is interconnected. To avoid bias in the influence of any one module, each is described at about the same level of complexity, with the description of any process being restricted to about 5 parameters. The model is hierarchical in structure and most processes are described in terms of a series of fluxes (or, more specifically, flux densities) that have dimensions of amount per area per time.The model can be closely linked to a database specifically developed for the Sustainable Grazing Systems National Experiment to allow easy importing and exporting of climate and experimental data for comparison with model output. This paper gives an overview of the model structure and its output, the process that was used for its development within Sustainable Grazing Systems, and its use by the Sustainable Grazing Systems sites and themes. Comments are provided on the implementation of the development process to assist future programs using a similar approach. "

This word can be translated as humility or lowliness of mind. There are different ways of understanding the nature of humility, i.e., there is controversy over what it is and what it requires of those who seek to exemplify this trait. The main focus of the chapter is an explanation and defense of analytic moral theology, the methodological approach the book takes in its analysis of the moral virtue of humility. This chapter argues that analytic moral theology can help to clarify the nature of humility in a way that is conducive to moral and spiritual formation, if it is done with these ends in mind."

It brings together justice between and justice within generations. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals summit in September 2015, and the Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015, brought climate justice center stage in global discussions. In the run-up to Paris, Mary Robinson instituted the Climate Justice Dialogue. The editors of this volume, an economist and a philosopher, served on the High Level Advisory Committee of the Climate Justice Dialogue. During this process they noted the overlap and mutual enforcement between the economic and philosophical discourses on climate justice, but also the great need for these strands to come together to support the public and policy discourse. The authors in this collection demonstrate various different ways of bringing about this integration."

Militating against narrow sectarian interpretations of Sri Ramakrishna’s philosophical teachings, Maharaj argues that Sri Ramakrishna’s philosophy is best characterized as “Vijñāna Vedānta,” a resolutely nonsectarian worldview—rooted in his own mystical experience of vijñāna—that harmonizes apparently conflicting religious faiths, sectarian philosophies, and spiritual disciplines. Maharaj first delineates five interpretive principles that he employs throughout the book in order to reconstruct Sri Ramakrishna’s philosophical views. He then elaborates the six main tenets of Sri Ramakrishna’s Vijñāna Vedānta. On the mystical basis of vijñāna, Sri Ramakrishna affirms that both the impersonal nondual Brahman of Advaitins and the loving personal God of theists are equally real aspects of one and the same Infinite Reality."

In response to this disparity, the discipline of systematic conservation planning has developed tools to optimize decision making for investing limited conservation funds in the most effective and transparent manner possible (Possingham et al. 2006). Since its origins in the mid-1980s, systematic conservation planning has grown rapidly, spawning hundreds of peer-reviewed papers (Pressey et al. 2007). Importantly, it now shapes policy legislation in many terrestrial and marine regions across the globe."
10.1071/aj10075,The influence of an intelligent operations philosophy on design and operation of remote large-scale oil and gas developments in Australia,"

Today's large-scale oil and gas developments are often characterised by reserves in increased water depths, increased distance from shore and remoteness from existing infrastructure. The use of an intelligent operations philosophy, to create a company capability to address these challenges, has identified significant opportunities for:

Enhancing health, safety and environmental performance, reserves recovery, production performance: and,
Attracting, developing and retaining people.

To deliver these benefits, a comprehensive approach to building this ""capability is required—systematically addressing people, process, organisation, physical environment and technology at each stage of the project. This paper illustrates the development of such an approach in a practical Australian context for forthcoming oil and gas developments."
10.1017/s003181910005974x,The Problem of the Model Language-Game in Wittgenstein's Later Philosophy,"In his Memoir of Wittgenstein Professor Malcolm describes the occasion on which, as far as he knows, the idea that as an activity language is a game, or that ‘games are played with words’, first occurred to Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein was passing a playing field where there was a game of football in progress. As he watched the game, the thought suddenly flashed into his mind, ‘We playgameswithwords!’ This account may be compared with that given by Professor von Wright, on the basis of Wittgenstein's own report, of the way in which he was with equal suddenness struck with the thought that a proposition is a ‘picture’. He was looking at a diagram which showed the positions of certain persons and vehicles involved in an accident—‘Thatis a proposition!’ was the thought which on this earlier occasion darted into Wittgenstein's mind. Thus, it seems, was germinated the theory developed in theTractatusthat propositions, that is to say, meaningful propositions, are ‘pictures of reality’ (Tractatus, 4.01)."

The objective of this work was to identify the effect of the presence or not of the disciplines Philosophy and Sociology in the High School curriculum on the students' learning. In terms of methodology, data from the Census of Basic Education 2015 and from the averaged per school performances in the ENEM 2015 were examined by means of several Data Science techniques more specifically, with the resources of the language R. The results of the analysis did not indicate any perceptible influence of the disciplines Philosophy and Sociology on the performance, unlike the Indicator of Student’s Socioeconomic Status and the Administrative Dependence of the School. These results seem to contradict the significant positive ones obtained after activities conducted by teachers trained in investigative philosophical dialogue in the classroom. Far from taking sides in the discussion about the pertinence of the inclusion of these disciplines in High School, what was sought here was to point out the need for a rethink about how they should be organised."
10.1017/s1479244317000178,SOCIAL CITIZENSHIP AND SOCIAL RIGHTS IN AN AGE OF EXTREMES: T. H. MARSHALL'S SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY IN THE LONGUE DURÉE,"This article demonstrates how T. H. Marshall's conceptualization of sociology—its subject, key questions and methodology—was embedded within broader moments in twentieth-century political history, including two world wars, the economic crisis of the interwar era, the onset of the Cold War and the rise of decolonization. In doing so, it brings intellectual history and the history of academic disciplines (particularly sociology) together with more recent trends in the historiography of twentieth-century Europe, including research on postwar democratization, reconstruction and the global spread of human rights discourses. Marshall was a sociological thinker in what Eric Hobsbawm has called the “age of extremes,” whose understanding of social citizenship not only played a role in theorizing the welfare state in postwar Britain, but also helped shape reconstruction within Europe and international development efforts following decolonization. In this respect, Marshall was part of a transnational and global movement to recast key concepts such as democracy, human rights and citizenship after the Second World War. This broader perspective illuminates how his work straddles traditions of pluralism and idealism, liberalism and social democracy, rather than being simply representative of any one of these schools of thought."
10.3390/philosophies3040033,Natural Philosophy and the Sciences: Challenging Science’s Tunnel Vision,"Prior to the nineteenth century, those who are now regarded as scientists were referred to as natural philosophers. With empiricism, science was claimed to be a superior form of knowledge to philosophy, and natural philosophy was marginalized. This claim for science was challenged by defenders of natural philosophy, and this debate has continued up to the present. The vast majority of mainstream scientists are comfortable in the belief that through applying the scientific method, knowledge will continue to accumulate, and that claims to knowledge outside science apart from practical affairs should not be taken seriously. This is referred to as scientism. It is incumbent on those who defend natural philosophy against scientism not only to expose the illusions and incoherence of scientism, but to show that natural philosophers can make justifiable claims to advancing knowledge. By focusing on a recent characterization and defense of natural philosophy along with a reconstruction of the history of natural philosophy, showing the nature and role of Schelling’s conception of dialectical thinking, I will attempt to identify natural philosophy as a coherent tradition of thought and defend it as something different from science and as essential to it, and essential to the broader culture and to civilization."
10.3390/philosophies3040041,The Naturalization of Natural Philosophy,"A new demarcation is proposed between Natural Philosophy and non-Natural Philosophy—philosophy tout court—based on whether or not they follow a non-standard logic of real processes. This non-propositional logic, Logic in Reality (LIR), is based on the original work of the Franco-Romanian thinker Stéphane Lupasco (Bucharest, 1900–Paris, 1988). Many Natural Philosophies remain bounded by dependence on binary linguistic concepts of logic. I claim that LIR can naturalize—bring into science—part of such philosophies. Against the potential objection that my approach blurs the distinction between science and philosophy, I reply that there is no problem in differentiating experimental physical science and philosophy; any complete distinction between philosophy, including the philosophy of science(s) and the other sciences is invidious. It was historically unnecessary and is unnecessary today. The convergence of science and philosophy, proposed by Wu Kun based on implications of the philosophy of information, supports this position. LIR provides a rigorous basis for giving equivalent ontological value to diversity and identity, what is contradictory, inconsistent, absent, missing or past, unconscious, incomplete, and fuzzy as to their positive counterparts. The naturalized Natural Philosophy resulting from the application of these principles is a candidate for the ‘new synthesis’ called for by the editors."

While a variety of theories — utilitarian, reciprocity based, and expressive — have been put forward to answer this question, there has been wide agreement among philosophers that the institution of legal punishment should be retained. Proponents of the various theories disagree chiefly why institutionalized punishment is necessary.

Socrates conducted challenging discussions in the agora of Athens; he began with examining everyday routine concepts, subjected his interlocutors to scrutiny—ἒλεγχος— showed the contradictions in their thinking, and often finally arrived at both his and their ignorance. The starting point of this paper is whether is it possible to teach Socratic philosophy following the Socratic Method. Here, we defend this possibility based on our practical experience of teaching Plato's Euthyphro to first-year students. In particular, the first author taught three groups of first-year philosophy students, for three semesters—Autumn 2016, Spring and Autumn 2017—in the Department of Philosophy at ATU (Allameh Tabataba'i University, Tehran, Iran)."

The first concerns to what extent, if at all, Avicenna’s deity can be said to act freely. The second concerns to what extent, if at all, humans within Avicenna’s philosophical system can be said to act freely. It is our contention that only through a careful analysis of Avicenna’s theory of action can one begin to assess his position concerning the status of the will and so provide a satisfactory response to these two interpretative issues. We hope to show that Avicenna can account for divine freedom and that, at least in the case of prophets and sages, humans too are capable of free action."
10.1163/15718182-02604004,Why Children have Rights: Children Rights in Janusz Korczak’s Education Philosophy,"Children are a weak part of society. They suffer injustice, their voice is unheard, their property is not theirs and they depend on adults in all aspects of their life. Even today, children are victims of war crimes, street violence, sexual abuse, hard labour, lack of proper education and insufficient life conditions. Their rights remain an unfulfilled promise.
We claim that children have rights, but what does it mean? Of course, we love our children, the challenge is not to define what we gracefully give but what children’s rights are, regardless of our own feelings? How can we substantiate the claim that children have rights? The legacy of Janusz Korczak, world-known children’s rights advocate (1878–1942), may help us in this task.
Korczak’s education legacy portrays a cluster of inspiring ideas: children are not people-in-the-making, but human beings here-and-now, they deserve our respect and respect implies ultimate rights. Korczak was not only a theoretician, but also an educationalist in practice who structured his children’s houses as democratic communities, directed by a children’s parliament, court, newspaper and other community common spaces of discussion and learning.
A major question remains: how we connect Korczak’s fragmented and isolated educational ideas and practices, each one inspiring and powerful on its own, into one integrated worldview? Can we connect all the dots into a meaningful picture that substantiates the claim that children have unconditional rights as human beings and not only as an arbitrary gesture of the adults? This study suggests that all of Korczak’s ideas and practices fit into the context of Greek philosophy and Korczak appears as a modern Stoic.
His Stoicism gives ground to the idea of children’s dignity and children’s rights as an immediate outcome of this dignity. In the infinity of the cosmos, there is no hierarchy of being. In this context, children have rights like any other human being."

The attainments of the curriculum what learning domains they corresponded to and what level of behavior they represented were analyzed. The study, found that all the attainments belonged to the cognitive domain and that out of the 21 attainments, 10 of them corresponded to representative behaviors at the comprehension level, 5 of them at the analysis level, 5 of them at the evaluation level and 1 of them at the knowledge level. The units integrated in the curriculum that referred to the periods of history of philosophy were named differently from widely accepted names used Philosophy literature. The descriptions of the attainments did not fully reflect the scope of some attainments and neglected some periods in the history of philosophy. Nevertheless, the curriculum had positive qualities such as philosophical writing, text reading and the inclusion of Turkish-Islamic philosophers. The study recommends that the identified problems should be resolved to make the curriculum functional and eliminate its defects."
10.32701/dp.19.1.8,Wittgenstein in Croatia On the occasion of 75 years of Wittgenstein in Croatian philosophy (1941–2016),"In the paper the author supplies an overview of the secondary research of Wittgenstein’s philosophy in Croatia in period 1941–2016. It was commonly assumed that the reception of his philosophy in Croatia started in 1960 when TLP was translated, and accompanied with substantive afterword by G. Petrović.
However, the author found an earlier mention and description of Wittgenstein’s
philosophy from TLP, which appeared in 1941 in the entry “Bečki krug (Wiener
Kreis)” in “Croatian Encyclopedia” and was written by Croatian philosopher
Stjepan Pataki. The entry is cited and analyzed. In addition, the author provides
the list of translations of Wittgenstein’s work to Croatian, and the list of a majority
of secondary literature on Wittgenstein by Croatian philosophers in the same
period."
10.4018/ijt.2019010101,"Philosophy, Past and Present","John Macmurray's controversial thesis: “All meaningful knowledge is for the sake of action and all meaningful action for the sake of friendship” is unpacked by explaining and illustrating what he means by the “personal.” He sees philosophy as a cultural phenomenon which expresses and responds to its historical context, and in turn affects how people think and behave. The Subject as Thinker, which has dominated modern philosophy, has led us to value knowledge for its own sake and trust theory over practice, needs to be replaced by the self as agent. The logic of the personal, in which the positive (e.g. action, love) is constituted and sustained by its negative (e.g. thinking, fear) arises out of personal relationship (“I-and-you”). Facing the problematic personhood may enable us to find meaning in relations with others, and face the future with hope."
10.1075/cat.8.3.10sho,Wittgenstein’s philosophy and action research,"Three themes seem to be common to both Greenwood’s and Gustavsen’s accounts: One is the social isolation of professional [research] elites from the concerns of ordinary people, which connects with another: the privileging of theory over practice. Both of these are connected, however, with a third: the great, unresolved struggle of ordinary people to gain control over their own lives, to escape from schemes imposed on them by powerful elites, and to build a genuinely participatory culture. An understanding of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy, and the recognition of its striking differences from any previous philosophical works, can make some important contributions to all these issues. Wittgenstein’s aim is not, by the use of reason and argument, to establish any foundational principles to do with the nature of knowledge, perception, the structure of our world, scientific method, etc. Instead, he is concerned to inquire into the actual ways available to us of possibly making sense in the many different practical activities we share in our everyday lives together: “We are not seeking to discover anything entirely new, only what is already in plain view.”"
10.1075/cat.5.3.05sho,Wittgenstein and his Philosophy of Beginnings and Beginnings and Beginnings,"Traditionally, compared with Wittgenstein, philosophers have begun their investigation too late in the day. They have thought of people as being already self-conscious, self-contained individuals, acting in a willful and intellectual manner. Indeed, they have interpreted Wittgenstein’s latter philosophy, and his claim that the meaning of a word is its use in the language, in this way: as if he were concerned with language only as a tool, or as move in a language-game, with words said willfully and intellectually. In this view, words have meaning only if they are systematically connected with states of affairs and/or states of mind. There is, however, another side to Wittgenstein: a concern with the beginnings of language-games in spontaneous bodily reactions, and with such reactions as being the prototypes for new ways of thinking rather than as the results of ones already in existence. Here, meaning is understood in terms of one’s direct and immediate responsiveness to one’s surroundings. This paper explores this side of Wittgenstein’s thought, and relates it to practical methods for beginning new practices, by noticing the presence within our old practices of such, usually unnoticed spontaneous bodily reactions."
10.1075/target.19.2.08lai,A literary work — Translation and original,"The focus of this paper lies on the translatability of a literary work of art. The phenomenon is approached as a conceptual challenge subsumed under the question Can the identity of a literary work of art be retained when the work is translated? Since the question of translatability as posed here belongs to the realm of philosophy of art, the problematic nature of ‘original’, ‘translation’ and ‘identity’ is discussed first in the theoretical context of analytic philosophy. I then consider the issue within the framework of Translation Studies. By showing the definitional diversity the necessity of contextual embedding and theoretical explicitness is highlighted. A genuine exchange of ideas and views, between and within disciplines, presupposes conceptual transparency."
10.1075/bpjam.1.03str,Compassion for Wisdom,"Abstract
		In studying the attitude of medieval philosophers towards the act of writing, scholars have tended to concentrate on their esoteric tendencies and their reluctance to commit philosophy to writing. The basic attitude of medieval philosophers to the decision to commit something to writing, whether it be that made by the prophets, the sages or the medieval philosophers themselves, however, is on the whole positive. This article examines the sources - both religious and philosophical - from which this positive attitude stems and then discusses its manifestations in the work of three medieval thinkers: Abu Nasr al-Farabi, Abu al-Barakat al-Baghdadl and Moses Maimonides."
10.1075/bpjam.00004.ale,The Supreme One,"In the prologue to his Commentary on Proclus’ Elements of theology Ioane Petritsi, Georgian Neoplatonist of the twelfth century, argues that the main subject of Proclus’ Elements is the theory of the supreme One. In Petritsi’s opinion, Proclus’ merit was to elaborate the philosophy of the ‘pure’, absolutely transcendent One which is unperceivable even for the Intellect. On the other hand, the supreme One is, in Petritsi’s interpretation, the cause of everything, including matter, and It has some positive (‘kataphatic’) characteristics which cannot be separated from Its hyper-essence. These are, mainly, Its causality and productivity, Its will and providential activity. The aim of this article is to analyse, what the supreme One is in Petritsi’s Commentary and to answer the following question: Do the absolute transcendence of the supreme One and Its positive characteristics contradict each other or are they in a certain way compatible with each other? I argue that for making the transition from the first aspect of the supreme One (Its transcendence) to another one (Its productivity) more coherent, Petritsi made an attempt to introduce in the ontological hierarchy one more one after the supreme One and before the Henads. In my opinion, this ‘second one’, which is almost inseparable from the supreme transcendent One, is Its another aspect, representing Its productive activity. For the same purpose, as I think, Petritsi identified the creative aspect of the One with the Logos/the Son of God and, in certain cases, also with Plato’s Demiurge."
10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.200,Punishment and Political Philosophy,"The punishment of criminal offenders constitutes a topic that has for many years received comprehensive attention, both in narrower academic circles and in broader public debate. This is not surprising. State-mandated infliction of death, suffering, or deprivation of freedom on citizens should from the outset be met with hesitation, and constitutes a practice which clearly calls for more profound considerations. Though the theoretical discussion of punishment has dealt with many conceptual and ethical issues, from an overall point of view, it is dominated by two questions.The first question, as indicated, concerns the justification of legal punishment. Why and under what conditions is it justified for the state to impose punishment on perpetrators? The traditional answers have been split between the utilitarian approach, according to which punishment can be justified in terms of its future desirable consequences, mainly crime prevention, and the retrospectively oriented retributivist approach, which justifies punishment in terms of just deserts. In the modern discussion, the picture has become more diverse. Consequentialist and retributivist justifications have been developed in many different versions and several attempts have been made to combine forward- and backward-looking considerations into coherent schemes. Moreover, genuinely new accounts of penal theories have also been presented.The second question concerns the issue of how different crimes should be punitively responded to. Though this question is obviously theoretically closely related to the first, it is also clear that the question of how individual offenders should be punished for their respective misdeeds prompts a plethora of more detailed challenges such as: What should determine the gravity of a crime? How should one determine the severity of a punishment? Are there types of punishment that should never be used in the criminal justice system (e.g., capital or corporal punishment)? Much of the contemporary discussion within penal theory is devoted to the task of providing principled solutions to these detailed challenges."
10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.88,Equality and Political Philosophy,"Equality is an undisputed political and moral value. But until quite recently, political philosophers have not fully explored its complexity. The literature on equality and egalitarianism is vast, complex, and multilayered—with over thirty-five years of philosophical discussion. Specifically, there are three major questions to ask about equality. First, what is equality? This question can be unpacked into two sub-questions. Distinguishing first between formal and distributive accounts of equality, we may ask what the currency of egalitarianism can be. The article goes through currencies such as welfare, resources, and capabilities, showing their respective strengths and weaknesses. A second important sub-question here is: what are the relevant scope and temporal dimensions of equality? Among whom is equality valuable, and precisely in what time frame is it valuable?This hints at the second major question, namely concerning the value of equality. Is equality indeed valuable, or are we confusing it with some other value, be it giving priority to the worse-off, or lifting individuals above a certain threshold of deprivation? The article goes through some famous criticisms of equality’s purported lack of value (e.g. the leveling down objection), explores some potential answers, and then examines the relative strength of equality’s two main rivals, namely priority and sufficiency.The third major question concerns what the proper account is of egalitarian justice. In particular, setting aside the question of currency, should our conception of distributive justice be informed by responsibility-sensitive accounts, or rather be focused on a responsibility-insensitive accounts that moreover place an emphasis on equality of relations rather than individuals’ holdings? We explore this in the two final sections, one devoted to understanding luck egalitarianism, and the other to its rival, relational egalitarianism."
10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.252,Multiculturalism and Political Philosophy,"Multiculturalism has been used both as a descriptive and a normative term, as well as a term referring to particular types of state policies. As a descriptive term, multiculturalism refers to the state of affairs present in contemporary societies: that of cultural diversity. As a normative term, multiculturalism affirms cultural diversity as an acceptable state of affairs, and provides normative grounds for accommodating this diversity. As a policy-oriented term, multiculturalism refers to a variety of state policies that aim to accommodate people’s cultural differences—most notably, different types of culturally differentiated rights.The main focus of the debates on multiculturalism within political philosophy has been on normative multiculturalism, and the broader normative questions relating to the appropriate grounds for responding to people’s cultural differences. The debates on descriptive multiculturalism and on particular multicultural policies, however, feed into the debates on normative multiculturalism. One’s views on the nature of culture, the value of culture, and the appropriate means of demarcating group boundaries have implications on the ways in which one understands the proper objects of cultural accommodation, as well as the extent to which such accommodation should be applied. The different types of multicultural policies—including rights of indigenous groups, immigrants, and national minorities—incorporate slightly different sets of normative considerations that must be independently assessed and that also feed into the more general debates on the normative foundations for cultural accommodation.Equality-based and identity-based arguments for cultural concern provide strong grounds for the state to be concerned about people’s cultural differences and to aim to alleviate culturally induced disadvantages. The case for (or against) culturally differentiated rights as a means for responding to these disadvantages may, however, come from several sources, including approaches to cultural diversity based on equality, autonomy, toleration, and state neutrality. While there is relative (albeit not full) agreement among normative theorists of multiculturalism that differentiated rights may be acceptable, though not always required or even desired, responses to cultural diversity, disagreements about the normative bases, and extents of application, remain."
10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.89,War in Political Philosophy,"We can distinguish between three moral approaches to war: pacifism, realism, and just war theory. There are various theoretical approaches to war within the just war tradition. One of the central disputes between these approaches concerns whether war is morally exceptional (as held by exceptionalists), or morally continuous with ordinary life (as held by reductive individualists). There are also significant debates concerning key substantive issues in the ethics of war, such as reductivist challenges to the thesis that combatants fighting an unjust war are the moral equals of those fighting a just war, and the challenge to reductivism that it undermines the principle of noncombatant immunity. There are also changing attitudes to wars of humanitarian intervention. One under-explored challenge to the permissibility of such wars lies in the better outcomes of alternative ways of alleviating suffering. The notion of unconventional warfare has also come to recent prominence, not least with respect to the moral status of human shields."
10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.343,Reason and Philosophy in Martin Luther’s Thought,"Throughout his academic life, Martin Luther was in constant discussion with philosophy. He was prepared for this with a substantial study of philosophy at the University of Erfurt, finishing with a master of arts degree. In many parts of Luther’s work, there are explicit discussions of philosophy, in the interpretation of biblical texts and in the definition of theological concepts. Quite early in his theological career, Luther became aware of the problematic dominance of Aristotelian scholastic philosophy in the formation and definition of theological concepts. He was always attempting to develop a clear distinction between philosophy and theology, which freed theology from the concepts of Aristotelian philosophy and from the limits of Aristotelian logic, but the same time respected the significance of philosophy. As Luther preferred clear critique and often used strident language for this, his sometimes polemical critique of philosophy, logic, and “the philosopher” (Aristotle) was often interpreted as a fundamental dismissal of philosophy. Since the late 20th century, research has presented a very different picture of Luther’s understanding of philosophy, of the role and significance he gave to philosophy theoretically and in his practical academic work, and of the relation of Luther’s references to Aristotle and the concrete Aristotelian philosophy in scholasticism, as well as to the relationship between theology and philosophy in general. All this research showed how deeply Luther was rooted in the philosophical discourses and contexts of late scholasticism and involved in the debates of nominalism. But this research also made clear how Luther successfully struggled to come to a very different model of the relationship between theology and philosophy than the models of scholasticism, which secured the independence of both intellectual disciplines despite their close relatedness their relatedness. Luther’s understanding of philosophy and philosophy’s significance for theology is closely related to his concept of reason. Again, there is some polemical critique of reason in Luther’s writings, but in fact Luther had a high appreciation of reason, when reason was in exploring the physical, social, and psychic reality and in shaping the natural, social, and moral world. Luther was critical and polemical toward reason when it was used in matters of faith. But although the use of reason in theology had its limits, it was nevertheless indispensable in theological work. This was especially clear in Luther’s hermeneutics, as reason was the means to come to the external clarity of biblical texts in the process of interpretation."
10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.013.317,Martin Luther in Modern European Philosophy,"Principally, Luther defers from philosophy’s authority to the authority of theology owing to an intense recognition of theology’s ultimate foundation in revelation. Allied to this is a suspicion about philosophy’s intellectual hubris and speculative neglect of the individual coram Deo (“before God”)—the “God” who is only known as revealed pro me (“for me”). As it transpires in modern philosophy’s emergence from its “service” to theology, variations of such concerns come to shape a new philosophical horizon which, for better or ill, come closer to Luther’s own in important and underexamined ways. Under implicit or explicit influence from Luther, key figures in modern European philosophy reconfigure critical new modes of philosophy which can be read to reflect Lutheran concerns about the nature of philosophy and reason itself. This story is related through key figures in modern philosophy (Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach, Kierkegaard, Heidegger), leading from the birth and apotheosis of the modern, through to the critical emergence of the postmodern. Through the critical reception of Luther in these philosophers, it is shown that modern European philosophy regularly deals with Lutheran tensions but often produces visions of the role of reason and selfhood which would have deeply troubled Luther himself. Nonetheless, there are also signs of a recovery of Luther’s suspicions about the possibilities of knowing which also bring into question the parameters of postmodern philosophy itself."
10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.013.276,Political Philosophy and Nationalism,"Theoretical debates for a better definition of nationalism have played a key role in understanding the core issues of history, sociology, and political sciences. Classical modernist theories of nationalism mainly synthesized former sociological and historical approaches with a political science perspective. Within the classical modernist perspective, the necessity and importance of transformation from traditional culture and society to a horizontal one in the agenda of modernization was characterized as a universal consequence of industrialization. Some of the foremost complexities and problems involved in the classical and contemporary studies of nation and nationalism include the logic of dualization; the definition of nationalism with reference to its substantive and paradigmatic nature; and whether it is possible to concretely construct a universal theory of nationalism. Both classical and contemporary theories of nations and nationalism can be postulated with reference to two major theoretical sides. Universalist theories of nations and nationalism focus on the categorical structure of nationalism in conceptual grounds while being associated with (neo)positivistic methodological points of departure. On the other hand, particularist theories of nationalism underline the immanent characteristics of nations and nationalism by going through nominalism and relativism in methodological grounds. Considering the conceptual, epistemological, and theoretical contributions of “postclassical approach to nationalism” in the 1990s, three major contributions in contemporary nationalism studies can be marked: the increasing research on gender, sexuality, and feminist social theory; the framework of “new social theory” or “critical social theory”; and the discussions derived from political philosophy and normative political theory."
10.1093/acrefore/9780190264093.013.51,Decolonial Philosophy and Education,"“Decolonial philosophy of education” is an almost nonexistent term. Consequently, rigorous intellectual and scholarly conversations on education tend to be centered around a specific set of concepts and discourses that were (and still are) generated, picked up or analyzed by thinkers from a specific geographical and political space, such as Socrates, Rousseau, Dewey, Heidegger, and Foucault. This has led to the systemic ignoring and violating concepts and ideas generated from other spaces and lived through by other people.This legacy can also be related to some philosophical aspirations for gaining total, hegemonic, and universal perceptions and representations often formulated by male Euro-American philosophers; when this intellectual passion for universality becomes coupled with or stays silent about imperial and expansionist ambitions, it can see itself implicated in creating assimilationist or genocidal practices: in education, the manifestation of universality associated with imperialism is observed in Indian residential schools. While the words education, literacy, curriculum, learning of languages, acquiring knowledge, school, school desks, and school buildings might normally echo positive vibes for many, it can make an aboriginal survivor of an Indian residential school shudder. It is furthermore hard to ignore the aspirations for a European/Universalist definition of human and man in the famous “Kill the Indian to save the child” policy of Indian Residential Schools. However, the likelihood of deeming such assimilationist attempts as benign acts of trial and error and as events external to philosophy is generally high. Therefore, the “colonial edge” of these philosophies are, more often than not, left unexamined.This is the plane where decolonial philosopher dwell. They deliberate on essential key moments and discussions in philosophical thought that have either not been paused at enough or paused at all, and thereby question this lack of attention. There is an important reason for these intellectual halts practiced by decolonial philosophers. While these might seem to be abstract epistemic endeavors, decolonial philosophers see their work as practices of liberation that aim beyond disrupting the eminence of mainstream Euro-American philosophical thought. Through these interrogative pauses, they hope to intervene, overturn and restructure the philosophical, political and social imaginations in favor of the silenced, the ignored, the colonized, and the (epistemologically and physically) violated.This article engages with certain key decolonial theses and is concerned with the hope of initiating and further expanding the dialogues of decolonization in the philosophy of education. The article will, however, stay away from adding new theses or theories to decolonial education. The author believes that this field, much like other paradigms, either can or will at some point suffer from theoretical exhaustion. Instead, it directs the readers to pause at some of the decisive moments discussed in decolonial theories."
10.18326/ijims.v8i2.281-308,Building peace through mystic philosophy: study on the role of Sunan Kalijaga in Java,"This paper aims to study the teachings of peace invented in the Javanese tradition particularly by Sunan Kalijaga. Sunan Kalijaga was a Muslim saint in the 15th century AD who taught mystical-philosophical teachings. His role permeates in the Javanese tradition so peaceful values that are embedded in its teachings still be traced and developed. We conducted a literature study on the role, influence and legacy of Sunan Kalijaga. We focused on his philosophical approach to religious thought as oppose to the mystical aspect. Our findings show that Sunan Kalijaga succeeded in using proper choice of words to combine Islamic values and predominant cultural elements (e.g., Hinduism, Buddhism). Therefore, instead of using the Arabic terms, Sunan Kalijaga used many old Javanese and Sanskrit terms commonly used in the 15th-16th century Javanese society. As an implication, Sunan Kalijaga created terms that are less Islamic but loaded with Islamic values. His examination is not only inherited into terms, but also practices, symbols and institutions. Among those Javanese traditions, some of them are critically important in supporting peace-building. This paper reaps the peaceful values of the Sunan teachings in the hope of countering the stream of extreme ideologies that have recently flooded the public. Paper ini bertujuan mengunduh ajaran damai yang ditanam dalam tradisi Jawaterutama yang disemai oleh Sunan Kalijaga. Sunan Kalijaga adalah seorang walipada abad ke 15 M yang memiliki ajaran bersifat mistis-filosofis. Hingga saat ini,pengaruh Sunan Kalijaga sangat terasa dalam tradisi Jawa sehingga nilai-nilaidamai yang ada dalam ajarannya masih dapat ditelusuri dan dikembangkan.Dengan menerapkan studi pustaka, data-data dalam riset ini dikumpulkan darisumber-sumber yang mengkaji Sunan Kalijaga, peran, pengaruh, dan warisanwarisannya.Oleh karena corak pemikiran keagamaan Sunan Kalijaga bersifatmistis-filosofis, maka aspek mistisisme dan pendekatan filsafat juga digunakandalam tulisan ini. Paper ini memaparkan temuan bahwa dalam pratiknya, SunanKalijaga melakukan permainan bahasa yang dengan cara tersebut ia berhasilmemadukan antara nilai-nila i keislaman dengan unsur buda y a dominanyang telah ada sebelumnya yaitu Hindu dan Buddha. Oleh karena itu, alihalihmenggunakan istilah Arab, Sunan Kalijaga justru banyak menggunakanistilah Jawa Kuna dan Sansekerta yang lazim digunakan dalam masyarakat Jawaabad 15-16. Hasil dari upaya tersebut, Sunan Kalijaga menghadirkan istilahistilahyang tampaknya kurang Islami namun sarat muatan nilai-nilai Islam.Ijtihad Sunan Kalijaga tidak hanya terwariskan menjadi istilah-istilah, namunjuga menjadi praktik, simbol bahkan melembaga. Dari beberapa bentuk tradisijawa yang diwariskan Sunan Kalijaga dapat diambil bebera p a nilai pentingyang mendukung iklim damai. Paper ini memetik nilai-nilai damai ajaran sangSunan tersebut dengan harapan dapat membendung arus ideologi ekstrim yangakhir-akhir ini semakin membanjiri ruang publik."
10.5840/beq200515330,On the Relevance of Political Philosophy to Business Ethics,"Abstract:
            The central problems of political philosophy (e.g., legitimate authority, distributive justice) mirror the central problems of business ethics. The question naturally arises: should political theories be applied to problems in business ethics? If a version of egalitarianism is the correct theory of justice for states, for example, does it follow that it is the correct theory of justice for businesses? If states should be democratically governed by their citizens, should businesses be democratically managed by their employees? Most theorists who have considered these questions, including John Rawls in Political Liberalism, and Robert Phillips and Joshua Margolis in a 1999 article, have said “no.” They claim that states and businesses are different kinds of entities, and hence require different theories of justice. I challenge this claim. While businesses differ from states, the difference is one of degree, not one of kind. Business ethics has much to learn from political philosophy."
10.5840/beq201020329,Business Ethics and (or as) Political Philosophy,"ABSTRACT:
            There is considerable overlap between the interests of business ethicists and those of political philosophers. Questions about the moral justifiability of the capitalist system, the basis of property rights, and the problem of inequality in the distribution of income have been of central importance in both fields. However, political philosophers have developed, especially over the past four decades, a set of tools and concepts for addressing these questions that are in many ways quite distinctive. Most business ethicists, on the other hand, consider their field to be primarily a domain of applied ethics, and so adopt methods and conceptual frameworks developed by moral philosophers. In this paper, we discuss some of the salient differences between these two approaches, and suggest some ways in which business ethicists could benefit from taking a more “political philosophy” approach to these questions. Throughout, we underline the importance of seeking greater compatibility among the principles used in normative theorizing about markets, regulations, corporate governance, and business practices."
10.18326/mlt.v3i1.1-28,Convergence Epistemologies of Legal Studies Perspectives of Islamic Philosophy,"Epistemology of knowledge, also epistemology of legal studies, which is derived from the senses, rationality, and inner voices, has their own analysis methods to attain truths; inductive reasoning to seek validity of empirical knowledge, deductive reasoning for knowledge based on reason or rationality, and intuition for that derived from inner voices. The three analysis methods often lead to debate and contradicting claims creating a conflicting truth in epistemology.This conflicting claims of truth results in stagnancy, deviation, and distortion, in which the truth attained during the process may be misused for certain parties, since in the field of law, truth may be established to accommodate one’s needs. Therefore, it is crucial to create a concept which reconciles various epistemologies in knowledge, as well in legal studies, which is through a convergence of epistemology in legal studies through the perspective of Islamic philosophy. Through Islamic philosophy which is based on Quran, a conflicting knowledge derived through the senses, rationality, and inner voices will reconcile in one central point.Islamic philosophy which is based on Quran is the basis for epistemological truth derived from the senses, rationality, and inner voices, to simultaneously and jointly understand and complement each others’ strengths and weaknesses through a circular triadic process in order to reach reconciliation."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-8-108-124,The Interconnections between Russian Philosophy and Other Realms of Public Consciousness,"Among the characteristic features of Russian philosophy, there is its openness and connections with other realms of public consciousness. In the Middle Ages Orthodox religion (i.e. theology as theoretical part of it) was trying to take over the main functions of Russian philosophy. Philosophy was not just under the aegis of religion, as it was in Western Europe and Byzantium, but in its depths. Active philosophical life manifested itself under non-philosophical covers. Russian literature also is involved in philosophy. A plenty of a philosophical writers could doubtlessly be called great. They are: Nikolai Gogol, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, etc. The things that each of them has brought into philosophy are very different in size and direction. As a result of the openness of Russian philosophy appears a unique ideological element which borders on natural science. This element was philosophical on its nature, but it had a strong and sound ties with natural science. No less important for Russian philosophy its connection with historical science. Philosophical ideas and categories are involved in the study of historical events and processes. Historical science, enriched with philosophy, does not remain extraneous to it. Philosophical historians also influenced different sections of philosophy: philosophy of history, social and political philosophy, philosophy of religion, philosophical anthropology… Russian philosophy penetrated into other spheres – music, painting, etc., where it was represented by quite significant figures, in particular – Alexander Scriabin, Nikolay Roerich. The philosophical views of Scriabin and Roerich were not limited to the framework of their theoretical, philosophical constructions. Artistic intuition embodied these constructions in the creation of art. Nowadays contacts of Russian philosophy in its various manifestations with other areas of intelligence also do not lose their attractiveness."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-8-90-107,Leo Tolstoy and the Search for True Christianity in Russian Philosophy,"In the article the basic principles of L. Tolstoy’s teaching are singled out, which according to his critics testify to its “non-Christian” character. Among these principles, there are emphasis on personal religious experience; emphasis on the importance of reason as the main ability of man in his relationship with God; the understanding of God as an impersonal absolute embracing all that exists. The main principle of Tolstoy’s teaching is the possibility of a person’s merging with God, this leads to the loss of the personality of man; on the other hand, after merging person with God evil, suffering and death become inessential: a religious person must come to an understanding of life as a blessing and realize his own eternity – uncreatedness and indestructibility. Jesus Christ is understood by Tolstoy as a great teacher, and not as a Savior: Christ brought the doctrine of how to make a life good and perfect. Tolstoy denies the idea of a personal bodily resurrection, considering it to be characteristic of Judaism; in the teaching of Tolstoy man is eternal, and death refers only to the empirical level of our existence. It is shown that Tolstoy’s teaching in all these principles coincides with the teaching of Gnostic Christianity. If the hypothesis that the Gnostic apocrypha express the most ancient layer of Christian ideas is true, Tolstoy’s teaching can be recognized as the exact expression of the true, original Christianity."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-8-7-22,Japanese Philosophy: Approaches to a Proper Understanding,"Since the role of the Asian countries is increasing in the modern world, their philosophical traditions attract more and more attention. Due to this trend, a more complete panoramic view of the development of world philosophy as a whole is accessible, and it has become possible to understand that any constructions of the human mind that have arisen in a particular cultural field of experience cannot be regarded as exemplary and absolute. The researchers of Asian philosophies concentrate mostly on studying the texts of individual thinkers. As a rule, they do not set themselves the task of examining these texts from the point of view of intercultural interactions and transformations of significant ideas and concepts in various cultural and historical contexts, defining the direction and mechanisms of cultural borrowing, as well as revealing new approaches and growth points. To achieve these goals, the research should focus at the problem of the self-determination and development of philosophy as a separate science in non-Western cultures, which are based on intellectual traditions with different origin than Greek and Judeo-Christian traditions. This article deals with the consideration of some topics that elucidate the features of the development of philosophical science in Japan, including the emergence of the concept of “philosophy” in this country, the definition of its subject, the formation of philosophical terminology, and various interpretations of what the term “Japanese philosophy” means. The author pays special attention to the characteristic of the main periods of progress of Japanese philosophical thought. In the conclusion, the author argues that the most important characteristic feature of the Japanese philosophy is its involvement in intercultural dialogue throughout its history."
10.4018/978-1-4666-8376-1.ch018,The Philosophy of Using Communicative Intelligence for Cross-Cultural Collaboration,"This chapter describes Communicative Intelligence (CI) from a philosophical lens. The author explains its cognitive, emotional and actionable elements. CI is the deliberate and intentional deployment of verbal and nonverbal communication patterns in ways that aspire to develop relationships across and within cultures in the unpredictably dynamic arena of human interactions (see Zoller, 2008). Further, the author suggests that CI is a consciously mindful state where the deliberate application of verbal and nonverbal skills and moves are used to achieve an alignment between the intended message and the manner in which it is perceived to build rapport, model empathy, and impact trust. By using the strategies and ways of thinking found in CI, leaders can improve the quality of their relationships resulting in new possibilities and solutions to the issues facing organizations. Key areas of interest will be discussed including how CI can be used to impact cross-cultural collaboration and leadership. "
10.6001/fil-soc.v29i1.3630,The Utilitarian Aspect of the Philosophy of Ecology: The Case of Corporate Social Responsibility,"This study aims to combine the philosophical perspective and the practical ethics of ecology in the everyday with a more pragmatic concept of corporate social responsibility. The importance of the latter is shown to be based in the abandonment of the distinction of subject and object and the development of personal as well as cultural ecological consciousness embedded in the notion of unity between man and nature. This philosophical shift in the consciousness is also reflected in terms of utility. Hence, the study examines whether the relationship between corporate social responsibility and firm’s sales growth is mediated by competitive advantage, and whether employees’ individual perception in the everyday and beliefs of social responsibility can play a moderating role on CSR-sales growth relationship. The analysis revealed that there is the link between CSR and sales growth and that there is a positive effect of CSR on sales growth which is positively moderated by employees’ individual beliefs of social responsibility which has been implied by the ecological consciousness."
10.1163/092598806x111604,Bulgarian Criminal Procedure: The New Philosophy and Issues of Approximation,"AbstractThe Bulgarian legal system forms part of the continental legal family and shares the main features of continental law. One of them is the codification of the main branches of law, among which is Criminal Procedure. In Bulgaria—as in all European countries—the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP) is the main source of procedural rules of law. It was adopted in 1974 and entered into force in 1975; it was notable in its similarity to the CCP of the Soviet Union.Since 1975, it has been subjected to a vast number of amendments, most of which were introduced after 1990 as a consequence of radical changes in the Bulgarian political, economic, and legal system. Some of the amendments to CCP have brought the criminal justice system in line with the new 1991 Bulgarian Constitution and with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR)—ratified by the Republic of Bulgaria in 1992—as well as with other international acts and obligations, signed or undertaken by Bulgaria. Other amendments have provided for conceptually new institutions, unknown prior to this period in the development of Bulgarian procedural theory and practice.In short, Bulgarian criminal procedure has—since 1990—been undergoing a period of major reform, the most significant expression of which is to be seen in amendments to CCP, adopted in 1999. They represent what is called a ""new philosophy"" of criminal procedure. The basic elements thereof are:— instituting judicial control over investigative acts and coercive measures affecting fundamental human rights (detention, house arrest, committing a person to a psychiatric hospital for examination, prohibition against leaving the country, searches, seizures, etc.);— speeding up and simplifying the criminal process;— introducing more adversarial elements into judicial proceedings;— introducing police investigation as an alternative to preliminary investigations under which most criminal offenses would be investigated by police officers through more informal police investigative procedures than those of the more formal preliminary investigation.

10.2178/bsl.1804010,The philosophy of logic ,"Abstract
            This talk surveys a range of positions on the fundamental metaphysical and epistemological questions about elementary logic, for example, as a starting point: what is the subject matter of logic—what makes its truths true? how do we come to know the truths of logic? A taxonomy is approached by beginning from well-known schools of thought in the philosophy of mathematics—Logicism, Intuitionism, Formalism, Realism—and sketching roughly corresponding views in the philosophy of logic. Kant, Mill, Frege, Wittgenstein, Carnap, Ayer, Quine, and Putnam are among the philosophers considered along the way."
10.1163/15718182-02502003,Philosophy with Children: A Rights-based Approach to Deliberative Participation,"In advancing children’s rights, and human rights more broadly, this article supports the view that participation through deliberation by children is desirable. Practising Philosophy with Children, through an approach such as Community of Philosophical Inquiry, is proposed as a powerful way forward as a rights-based means of supporting children to deliberate about matters affecting them in society. In considering that children are educated about, through and for rights, an example of children’s philosophical dialogue is provided to illustrate children deliberating on rights issues, and how teachers might use such dialogue to influence their teaching in this area. The suggestion is that participating in practical philosophy enables children to practise human rights behaviour as a means of participating beyond consultation exercises and as an approach to facilitating their engagement with ideas and issues that are important to the promotion of rights for all."
10.1163/18756735-073001004,Lost on the Way from Frege to Carnap: How the Philosophy of Science Forgot the Applicability Problem,"This paper offers an explanation of how philosophy of science in the second half of the 20 century came to be so conspicuously silent on the problem of how to explain the applicability of mathematics. It examines the idea of the early logicists that the analyticity of mathematics accounts for its applicability, and how this idea was transformed during Carnap's efforts to establish a consistent and substantial philosophy of mathematics within the larger framework of Logical Empiricism. I argue that at the end point of this development, philosophical discussion of the applicability problem was terminated although important aspects of the logicists' original response to the applicability problem had had to be sacrificed along the way."
10.1163/18756735-09403009,Husserl’s Philosophy of the Categories and His Development toward Absolute Idealism,"In recent work, Amie Thomasson has sought to develop a new approach to the philosophy of the categories which is metaphysically neutral between traditional realist and conceptualist approaches, and which has its roots in the ‘correlationalist’ approach to categories put forward in Husserl’s writings in the 1900s–1910s and systematically charted over the past few decades by David Woodruff Smith in his studies of Husserl’s philosophy. Here the author aims to provide a recontextualization and critical assessment of correlationalism in a Husserlian vein. To this end, the author presents, first, the reasons why, later in his life, Husserl himself found his earlier treatment of categories philosophically naive, and why he increasingly advocated for a more genetic-teleological account. The author then draws upon arguments made a century earlier by Schelling and Hegel, in criticism of Fichte, to point up what might remain philosophically unsatisfying about even the post-correlationalist genetic position of the later Husserl, in light of the pronounced trend in Husserl’s own development, on the questions of reason and spirit, toward absolute idealism."
10.1163/18757405-022001012,"Beckett and Philosophy, 1928-1938","This article argues that the direct relationship between 'Beckett and philosophy' – meaning Samuel Beckett's struggle with Western philosophy as it influenced his poetics and outlook – lasted only a decade, from 1928 to 1938. The methodology deployed in support of this account is established at the outset: falsifiability. Such a 'modified essentialism' allows for an empirically-grounded theorising that is of substantial assistance in tracing Beckett's intellectual 'debts.' The falsifiable position taken here, then, contends that Beckett's self-education in the European philosophical tradition can be divided into three stages which, in turn, closely correspond to Beckett's artistic and intellectual development in the later 1920s and 1930s."
10.1163/18757405-90000110,"BECKETT'S ""FIRST LOVE"" AND CYNICAL PHILOSOPHY","Situating Beckett's ""First Love"" in the philosophical tradition of cynicism allows us to approach the text comprehensively. Evidence of Beckett's own cynical attitude supports several of the overt themes of the work: vanitas, or the irrelevance of human actions, the outsider or misanthrope, scatology or obscenity, and the demystification of love and other high values. Further analysis of intertextual relationships (e.g., Dante) and genre affinities all leads to the conclusion that the characters, their behaviour, their motives, and their emotions are a direct heir to the cynics' worldview. Moreover, ""First Love"" aims to express and pass on the cynical philosophy through the comic mode."
10.2307/628543,Right and Left in Greek Philosophy,"The purpose of this article is to consider how the symbolic associations which right and left had for the ancient Greeks influenced various theories and explanations in Greek philosophy of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. The fact that certain manifest natural oppositions (e.g. right and left, male and female, light and darkness, up and down) often acquire powerful symbolic associations, standing for religious categories such as pure and impure, blessed and accursed, is well attested by anthropologists for many present-day societies. Robert Hertz, in particular, has considered the significance of the widespread belief in the superiority of the right hand, in his essay ‘La prééminence de la main droite: étude sur la polarité religieuse’ [Revue Philosophiquelxviii (1909), 553 ff., recently translated into English by R. and С. Needham inDeath and the Right Hand(London, 1960) 89 ff.]. It is, of course, well known that the ancient Greeks shared some similar beliefs, associating right and left with lucky and unlucky, respectively, and light and darkness with safety, for example, and death. Yet the survival of certain such associations in Greek philosophy has not, I think, received the attention it deserves. I wish to document this aspect of the use of opposites in Greek philosophy in this paper, concentrating in the main upon the most interesting pair of opposites, right and left. Before I turn to the evidence in the philosophers themselves, two introductory notes are necessary. In the first, I shall consider briefly some of the evidence in anthropology which indicates how certain pairs of opposites are associated with, and symbolise, religious categories in many present-day societies. The second contains a general summary of the evidence for similar associations and beliefs in pre-philosophical Greek thought."
10.20944/preprints201812.0042.v1,Information in Science and Buddhist Philosophy: Towards a Non-Materialistic Worldview,"Information theory has been developed for seventy years with technological applications that have transformed our societies. The increasing ability to store, transmit, and process information is having a revolutionary impact in most disciplines. The goal of this work is to compare the formal approach to information with Buddhist philosophy. Considering both approaches as compatible and complementary, I argue that information theory can improve our understanding of Buddhist philosophy and vice versa. The resulting synthesis leads to a worldview based on information that overcomes limitations of the currently dominating physics-based worldview."
10.1093/oso/9780190222055.001.0001,The Philosophy of Quantitative Methods,"This book is concerned with the conceptual foundations of research methods. In particular, it undertakes a philosophical examination of a number of different quantitative research methods that are prominent in, or relevant for, the conduct of research in the behavioral sciences. By doing so, the deep structure of the methods is examined in order to overcome the shallow and uncritical understanding that is typically provided by textbooks and other instructional sources. The methods submitted to critical examination are important and mostly well known. They are exploratory data analysis, statistical significance testing, Bayesian confirmation theory and statistics, meta-analysis, and exploratory factor analysis. The treatment of the research methods examined is consistent with a philosophy of scientific realism. Theories of scientific method feature prominently in the discussions of the research methods. Each chapter contains a Further Reading section in order to help the reader extend their thinking beyond what the chapters contain."

10.33186/1027-3689-2018-1-102-111,Bibliography and philosophy. Reflections on the book “The essay of the evolution of bibliography poetics” by Valery Leonov,"Valery P. Leonov proposed an original approach, opening prospects for the development of bibliographic studies in the digital age. The book's title conceptualizes and designates a new research program. The poetics of the bibliography is more than a theory of fine literature. It is understood as cultural-historical discipline combining information and humanistic functions of books. As a result of the very thorough analysis of the works on history and theory of literature, he concludes that the poetics should be understood as an art of bibliography. Leonov’s poetics of bibliography reveals the cultural and anthropological value of reading and writing, restores the high status of printed books. The library is seen as an important institution of socialization and humanization. The relevance and significance of the book are emphasized. V. Leonov has compiled the massive array of historical sources and current publications that modern bibliographers should get familiar with. The study findings may apply to developing new education courses in bibliography. The book will be of interest to professionals and the wide audience."
10.3390/rel9120410,The Status of Saying: Witness against Rhetoric in Levinas’s Philosophy,"In regard to rhetoric, Emmanuel Levinas stands against its violence. In spite of the rhetoric, he justifies the notion of discourse in Totality and Infinity in order to prove the possibility of the ethical relationship between the Same and the Other. In later works, he also criticizes the ontological language, which is used in the tradition of occidental philosophy. He explores a third way and proposes the notion of Saying, opposed to Said, as ethical language, witness in Otherwise than Being. However, there is a paradoxical structure of language. Although the Saying precedes the Said, the system of language and even the ontological language, it has to be reduced to this latter when it is expressed as philosophical form. The present study situates what is at stake in the criticism of rhetoric and ontological language by Levinas and examines the notion of witness as opposed to these forms of language. Witness is a concrete form of ethical language that consists in “for the other” of the ultimate passivity of the subjectivity. Therefore, the Saying is possible only as witness where the subject is exposed to “a calling into question” by the Other."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474413909.001.0001,Return Statements,"Gregg Lambert examines the internal relationship between the return of overtly religious themes in contemporary philosophy over the past decade and another sense of the ‘post-secular’ turn that has been taking place globally following the events of 9/11. He asks how these two ‘returns to religion’ can be taking place simultaneously without appearing as the same horizon of the West viewed from opposing perspectives of the globe? Through a series of reflections on the ‘return statements’ performed by such contemporary philosophers as Alain Badiou, John D. Caputo, Jacques Derrida, and Jean-Luc Nancy, Lambert discovers the unique sense of the term ‘religion’ that belongs exclusively to our contemporary perspective - a sense whose bio-political meaning is both unprecedented and foreboding."
10.3366/edinburgh/9780748695942.001.0001,A Feminine Enlightenment,"
                  A Feminine Enlightenment argues that women writers shaped Enlightenment conversations regarding the role of sentiment and gender in the civilizing process. By reading women’s literature alongside history and philosophy and moving between the eighteenth century and Romantic era, this book challenges conventional historical and generic boundaries. Beginning with Smith’s philosophical meditation on feeling in his Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and reaching into the early nineteenth century, A Feminine Enlightenment connects Smith’s theory of feeling to the sentimental poems and novels of Anna Seward and Regina Maria Roche. Likewise, it tracks discussions of “women’s progress” and historical and commercial development from the rarified atmosphere of mid-eighteenth-century Bluestocking salons and the masculine domain of the Scottish university system to the popular Minerva Press novels of the early nineteenth century. The effect of this study is twofold: to show how developments in eighteenth-century women’s literature reflected and engaged with Enlightenment discussions of emotion, sentiment, and commercial and imperial expansion; and to provide new literary and historical contexts for contemporary conversations that continue to use “women’s progress” to assign cultures and societies around the globe a place in universalizing schemas of development."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474415859.001.0001,The World of Image in Islamic Philosophy,"This book traces the notion of a world of image from its conception until today. This notion is one of the most original innovations in medieval Islamic philosophy, and is unique compared to other parts of the history of philosophy. The notion originated out of discussions on the fate of human beings after death; would this be spiritual only or physical as well? The world of image suggests that there exists a world of non-physical (imagined) bodies, beyond our earthly existence. This world may be entered after death and glimpses of it may already be witnessed during sleep or meditation. Ibn Sīnā (d. 1037) was the first to suggest something along these lines, arguing that people could simply imagine their afterlife without the need for it to be actually physical. Suhrawardī (d. 1191) included this suggestion in his innovative thinking on epistemology, known as ‘knowledge by presence’, without fully ontologizing it. Shahrazūrī (d. &gt; 1286), finally, turned Suhrawardī’s thinking into the full-blown notion of a world of image. Notably through Taftāzānī (d. 1390) and Shaykh Bahāʾī (d. 1621), the idea gained wider popularity and continued to be discussed, especially in Shīʿī circles, up to this day. This book gives an insight into late medieval and early modern Islamic philosophy, especially the role of commentary writing. It sets the record straight for the provenance and development of the world of image and reconsiders the importance of Suhrawardī for the development of philosophy in the Islamic world."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474429344.001.0001,Practising with Deleuze,"
                  Practising with Deleuze offers the first systematic reading of Gilles Deleuze’s mature philosophy from the perspective of contemporary creative practitioners, including fine artists, a dancer, a creative writer, designer and philosopher. It offers a way of rethinking notions of aesthetics, art, and creativity within the field of practice. Unconventional in presentation, this book is reflective of the engagement of contemporary creative practices with the generative philosophy of Deleuze. Each chapter focuses on a key aspect of production - practising, forming, framing, experiencing, and encountering - and is accompanied by short summary texts outlining the context of Deleuze’s contributions to each of these aspects. These discussions contextualise Deleuzian thought within a range of practices. In so doing, they enable the reader to approach these philosophical concepts within the milieu of creative practice."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474414739.001.0001,French Philosophy Today,"After the humanism/anti-humanism debates of the 1940s and ’50s, and after the ‘death of man’ in the linguistic philosophy of the late twentieth-century, French philosophy today is laying fresh claim to the human. This is not to be mistaken for a return to previous ideas of the human, nor is it posthumanism, strictly speaking. It is a series of fundamentally independent and yet strikingly simultaneous initiatives arising in the writing of diverse French thinkers to transform and rework the figure of the human. This book brings together these new figures of the human for the first time, offering the a critique of this contemporary trend in terms of the three categories: the human as ‘capacity’ (Badiou and Meillassoux), as ‘substance’ (Malabou) and as ‘relation’ (Serres and Latour). Tracing these varied transformations of the human makes visible for the first time one of the most widespread, surprising and potentially transformative trends in contemporary French thought. 
This book draws out both the promises and perils inherent in today’s attempts to rethink humanity’s relation to “nature” and “culture”, to the objects that surround us, to the possibility of social and political change, to ecology and to our own brains, arguing that the stakes of this project are high for our technologically advanced but socially atomised and ecologically vulnerable world.

10.21913/jps.v3i1.1299,Philosophy for children with learners of English as a foreign language,"The present study intends to provide empirical evidence on the effect of Philosophy for Children (P4C) integrated with English picture storybook instruction on adolescent learners of English as a foreign language. Previous studies have documented the instructional benefits of P4C in various fields; very little evidence, however, can be found in ESL (English as a second language) or EFL (English as a foreign language) contexts. The present study was therefore carried out to explore the beneficial effects of P4C applied in EFL instruction with picture storybooks as instructional materials. A total of 62 students participated in the study, divided into one P4C group and one non-P4C group. Participants in the P4C group underwent 10 weeks of English storybook instruction with P4C in a school club, and the effects of instruction were measured by questionnaires and reading comprehension tests. Results of the study showed that students in the P4C group experienced a slightly higher level of English learning anxiety, retained higher English learning motivation after the instruction, and improved their English reading comprehension. Finally, pedagogical implications are presented. "

A Study of Fourth-Year College (13/14 Years of Age) Philosophical Writings Produced Within the PreCPhi/Philosophemes Corpus,"Creative thinking is sometimes neglected by schools. Introducing philosophy in schools represents a commitment to balancing the development of logical and creative thinking, currently exercised only orally. In the present study, the focus is on writing. Firstly, the value of authentic pupil writings is underscored. The pupils and students studied wrote texts for “Adolescence et Société”, a magazine produced by researchers. 100 students’ works, written by philosophizing students in fourth-year college in France, culled from the PreCPhi/Philosophemes Corpus (1,300 texts collected from 43 classrooms) were studied in order to measure the progress of philosophizing students between a pre-test and a post-test following the introduction of a pedagogical tool that unites Art with Philosophy, Philo &amp; Carto. Their writing skills were measured according to the following five dimensions: linguistic, philosophical, cognitive, reflective and creative. Performance measures, calculated on group averages and applied to the group’s variance between the pre- and the post-tests, were related to each dimension. Linguistic performance (presence of an introduction and conclusion) did not progress, remaining subject to pupils’ academic level. Philosophical, cognitive, creative and reflective performance increased significantly, or at least confirmed the trend. Reasoning, metaphors, conceptual differences and discourse ownership increased, while anecdotal examples decreased. These increases were accompanied by an increase in the post-test variance: gaps between the strongest and the weakest performances widened, except in the case of questioning, personal examples and generation of doubt, which were at the core of the effect produced. The study validates the fact that the Art and Philosophy link promises unprecedented educational prospects with regard to the production of early quality philosophical writings. This will require validation with other samplings."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474411844.003.0007,On the Origins of Conventionalist Political Philosophy in the Seventeenth Century,"At the basis of any consideration about the modern state of experience lie concepts of great theoretical and practical import, such as the dialectic between private and public, ‘internal’ and ‘external’, essence and appearance, which only a historiographic-philosophical investigation into the origins of the new conventionalistic concept of political order allows us to clarify. I will endeavour, therefore, in the following notes, to focus on the theoretical elements that the new political anthropology injected into the circuitry of sixteenth-century Europe, thanks especially to key thinkers such as Montaigne and Charron, convinced as I am of their thematic relevance in the context of a closer analysis of that phenomenon of primary importance now called, to use Benjamin’s term, the ‘crisis experience’...."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474402637.003.0003,On Property and the Philosophy of Poverty: Agamben and Anarchism,"This chapter discusses Agamben’s work in the context of the split between the anarchist and cmmunist strands of the revolutionary tradition. One of the few points at which anarchism explicitly appears in Agamben’s work is The Time That Remains where, in the context of a discussion of klesis (calling), class, and the role of the proletariat in Marxist thought, he identifies in Max Stirner an ‘ethical-anarchic interpretation of the Pauline as not’. Bignall draws on Marx’s ridiculing of Stirner’s ‘ethical-anarchism’ and his critique of Proudhoun, to argue that Agamben’s recent work on poverty and use bring him closer to the communitarian anarchist tradition than to Marx’s governmental communism. The chapter concludes by suggesting that Agamben’s thought extends anarchist critiques of property to the level of social ontology and so should be read as a restoration of anarchism to its potential for use in the present."
10.3366/edinburgh/9780748697243.003.0003,Information and Event: Lyotard’s Philosophy of Information,"This chapter interprets Lyotard’s remarks on information in the wider context of information theory and philosophy of information. It situates him as a philosopher of information who, despite a lack of specialist, technical knowledge of information theory, contributes to a reflective, philosophical understanding of information on two levels: the social impact of information, and the ontology of information. The chapter criticises Lyotard for failing to distinguish between theories of data transmission such as Shannon’s pivotal Mathematical Theory of Communication and semantic conceptions of information, yet argues that his critique nonetheless applies to many of the more recent semantic theories. The chapter concludes with a programmatic outline for how Lyotard’s critical intervention in the “linguistic turn” in The Differend might be developed for a critical intervention in the “informational turn,” an intervention which revolves around the question of how the event in the Lyotardian sense might be thought within an information-theoretic framework."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474408820.003.0003,"Reading a Dead Man’s Mind: Hellenistic Philosophy, Rhetoric and Roman Law","Which Hellenistic school of philosophy was most influential in the development of Roman law, Stoicism or the New Academy? Within the broader and familiar topic of the connection between philosophy, rhetoric and law in ancient Rome, an unequivocal, or at least potentially persuasive, answer to this question has so far remained elusive. While we would caution against overheated expectations of a conclusive resolution, we believe that the concept of the voluntas testatoris, whose interpretation was as much a matter of debate in Roman antiquity as it is now among Romanists, will bring us closer. Using this notion as a case study, we will argue that while the Roman jurists did not construct a balanced and general voluntas testatoris theory, they might in this area at least have been more likely to favour the New Academy approach."
10.3366/edinburgh/9780748699803.003.0002,‘The Empire of the Imagination’: The Association of Ideas in Hume’s Social Philosophy,"This chapter deals with the philosophical foundations of Hume’s social and political philosophy. Hume scholars have discussed his theory of association of ideas as a purely philosophical one. As many eighteenth-century critics were acutely aware, however, this theory must been considered an aspect of Epicureanism; one which allegedly undermines the spiritual aspect of human reason and virtues by transforming them into the mere consequences of habit and custom. What differentiates Hume’s associationist theory from more materialistic versions lies in the former’s emphasis on the psychological (not physiological) explanation of the workings of imagination. This is closely related to his defence of moral causes and his criticism of natural causes in the essay ‘Of National Characters’, which was to influence William Godwin. Although Duncan Forbes claims that Hume lost interest in his associationist theory after the Treatise, Hume in fact maintained a strong interest in this theory throughout his writings because the workings of imagination were the keystone for Hume in his continual investigations of the cultural diversity of human institutions."
10.3366/edinburgh/9780748698998.003.0004,Lenin’s Philosophy: A New Dialectics of Revolution?,"This chapter argues against the Hegelian-Marxist narrative, in which Lenin’s reading of the Science of Logic in 1914 led him to refound Marxist dialectics. Through a close reading of Lenin’s Philosophical Notebooks it is shown that although he made withering remarks about Engels’s and Plekhanov’s dialectics, this did not lead Lenin to reject the core principles of dialectical materialism. Indeed, it is demonstrated that Lenin neither intended to nor accomplished a refoundation of Marxist dialectics in 1914. The notion of quantity-quality leaps Lenin adds to his works from the time onwards show him less as an innovator in Marxist philosophy and more as a keeper of the flame of dialectical materialist orthodoxy."
10.3366/edinburgh/9780748695416.003.0009,"Muhammad Iqbal: Restoring Muslim Dignity through Poetry, Philosophy and Religious Political Action1","This concluding chapter details how Muhammad Iqbal aimed to re-establish Muslim dignity under the British Raj. Iqbal diagnosed a wound within the modern Muslim soul, caused by two injuries — first, a paternalistic colonialism justified through particular socio-political, philosophical, and religious doctrines and, second, the intellectual laziness and lack of courage on the part of the Muslims themselves. The medicine that Iqbal prescribes is the empowerment of the self (khudi). These newly empowered Muslims will be able to revitalise the community and confidently assert themselves against oppressive rule. However, in order to see a khudi-empowered community realised, Indian-Muslims need to be committed to instilling the necessary character traits within themselves."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410991.003.0018,Nietzsche on Greek and Indian philosophy,"Nietzsche was struck by the similarities between Greek and Indian philosophy. From the perspective elaborated in On the Genealogy of Morality - in which values are derived from the physiogical, psychological, and social domains - we would expect the similarities of thought to derive from similarities in the conditions of the two cultures. A role is played here by the agonal spirit manifest in the Iliad, Hesiod and Heraclitus as well as in Indian philosophy and in the Mahabharata and Ramayana. Nietzsche found in both cultures viable models of self and state, born from an agonal context, that provided for him modes of being alternative to the Christian slave morality that he despised."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474410991.003.0002,The common origin approach to comparing Indian and Greek philosophy,"This chapter focuses on two kinds of similarity between the two cultures that relate to their shared Indo-European origin. One is a series of correspondences between the journeys to the next world in the Odyssey and in the Kausitaki Upanishad. The other arises from a critique of the Indo-European 'trifunctional ideology' found by Dumézil in Greece and India. The total of three and category of socila function are both too restrictive for a worldview. Dumézil's triadic structure should be replaced with a pentadic one, in which the triad acquires at the bottom what is undesirable and at the top something transcendent. A pentadic structure is found in, for axample, the philosophy known as Samkhya and in the Greek set of five elements."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474405355.003.0002,"The Right of Philosophy and the Facts of History: Foucault, Derrida, Descartes","This chapter proposes a counter-history of a seminal debate in the transition from structuralism to post-structuralism. It calls into question the widespread assumption that Derrida rejects Foucault’s structuralist stranglehold by demonstrating that the meaning of a text always remains open. Through a meticulous examination of their respective historical paradigms, methodological orientations and hermeneutic parameters, it argues that Derrida’s critique of his former professor is, at the level of theoretical practice, a call to return to order. The ultimate conclusion is that the Foucault-Derrida debate has much less to do with Descartes’ text per se, than with the relationship between the traditional tasks of philosophy and the meta-theoretical reconfiguration of philosophic practice via the methods of the social sciences."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474408820.003.0004,Law’s Nature: Philosophy as a Legal Argument in Cicero’s Writings,"The paper deals with the use of philosophical arguments in Cicero's legal writings, in particular his forensic speeches. It tries to demonstrate that Cicero developed a unique, holistic theory of law, which is not based on a juxtaposition of natural law and positive law, but tries to deduce the nature of law from the nature of men. Even though this theory probably did not influence the writings of the later classical jurists in a direct way, Roman law was open enough for philosophical arguments to allow Cicero to make use of this theory within the legal discourse. Using examples from Cicero's forensic speeches, the paper demonstrates how Cicero refers to his philosophical concept in order to develop specifically legal arguments."

It then traces connections between passivity, radical reflection, and indirect ontology in Merleau-Ponty, to show how Meillassoux, contra Merleau-Ponty, takes the activity of thinking for granted and neglects passivity, in ways that lead to ontological confusions and assumptions about being's determinate character. The latter troubles Meillassoux’s ancestrality problem and leads him to overlook a radically contingent being indicated within correlation itself. The final section clarifies and supports this claim via physics, specifically the measurement problem in quantum mechanics—a concrete problem that Meillassoux does not discuss when he broadly invokes mathematics and science to support his position."

Although commentators have tended to base their understandings of Hume as a conservative thinker on his repeated emphasis on the importance of custom and habit to consolidate our beliefs, Hume’s anti-rationalism and emphasis on custom do not necessarily lead him to defend ‘tradition’ as such indiscriminately. Rather, his point lies in revealing that what is normally considered ‘tradition’ in fact consists of nothing but public opinion concerning what is thought to be established. This chapter will also reveal that this viewpoint is consistent with Hume’s criticism of the myth of the ancient constitution and social contract theory. This point is vital for our understanding of the ‘historical’ Hume, because some of his contemporaries criticised his History not only for his alleged Toryism, but also for his inconsistency with these earlier standpoints."

The chariot journey described in the prologue of Parmenides is influenced by the chariot race in Iliad book 23, which also influenced Empedocles and Socrates. In the Katha Upanishad the chariot is a metaphor for sacrifice and fire altar, and a redeployment of the chariot imagery and narrative setting used in the earlier Katha Brahmana.The metaphysics of the Katha Upanishad should be contextualised as the component of a hieratic canon."

Gábor Áron Zemplén introduces Newton’s theory of colours, focusing primarily on the images Newton used to illustrate his essays. The paper analyses the first, 1672, version of Newton’s theory of colours, and highlights the fifth thesis about the number of simple colours in the rainbow. Although Newton thinks the rainbow can be divided into an infinite number of colours, his answer remains polysemic. Zemplén argues that the polysemy is intentional: the father of modern physics wanted to evade open confrontation with disciples of traditional models of physics and optics.&#x0D;

The paper investigates the concepts ’subject’ and ’memory’ and their relation in Bergson’s philosophy. The main issue is whether memories constitute the subject or it is the subject that re-collects its memories, thereby reconstituting itself continually. The paper starts out from Bergson’s Matter and Memory (1896), in which Bergson aimed at escaping the boundaries of dualism. He was looking for a third method in order to unify the opposition of the previous two by relying on the method of direct experience and the logic of common sense, not on analytical-synthetizing reason. He studied the connection and interaction of mind and matter to reveal the mysterious workings of memory. He insists on one principle, that “the whole is more than the sum of its parts.”&#x0D;

Mihály Polányi critiques theories of knowledge that seek to define and justify knowledge on an objective basis. For him, gaining knowledge and justifying knowledge can only be explained in the personal dimension, as knowledge cannot be thought of without a person who knows. If anyone seeks to address the boundaries of his or her knowledge, s/he will arrive at the act of personal trust. The final possibility of justification is the clause “because I think so.”  Yet Polányi distinguishes the personal dimension from the subjective dimension: while personal knowledge leads towards truth, subjective knowledge leads towards failure. Personal knowledge joins two poles, the internal world of the person and the outer world of reality. This meeting point prevents personal knowledge from becoming subjective.&#x0D;
Knowledge that comes together in this framework is a responsible decision which joins a person’s subjective ideas to reality and transforms it into personal knowledge. The paper examines Polányi’s concept of truth and compares it to other theories of it (correspondence theory, coherence theory, Taski’s semantics theory).&#x0D;

This paper points out the relation between the notion of the sublime and the notion of the infinite in Kant’s transcendental philosophy. In Kant the philosophical functions of the sublime can be related to the notion of the infinite as an idea. The paper investigates whether the imagination can be extended by the infinite, as this is not evident from Kant’s definition of the sublime. Also, the paper addresses the problem if the infinite has a role beyond the purely aesthetic dimension of Kantian philosophy.&#x0D;

10.14232/kulonbseg.2011.11.1.26,Philosophy in Images: Analogies in Diderot’s D’Alembert’s Dream,"&#x0D;
In the 18th century literature and the sciences were considered complementary to each other. The Encyclopaedia’s entries explain that sciences help the improvement of literature, while science is made enjoyable by literature. Similarly, Diderot explains that philosophy, literature and the sciences assist each other. Diderot’s materialist philosophy of nature holds that nature has never been and will never be the same as one sees it in the present because the material of the Universe is always in motion. Therefore it is not sufficient to contemplate what is given in nature but all its possible versions should be accounted for. One can reveal necessary connections in nature by relying on one’s imagination, observations and suppositions. Diderot often reflects on the problem of the language of philosophy, and he uses many images in his philosophical texts that create his unique style. Senguin claims Diderot has created “the philosophy of images.” The paper names these images “analogies” and defines analogy as one version of the simile.&#x0D;
The paper argues that Diderot relies on analogies to describe processes of the human body, and that these analogies function to trigger the imagination of the reader. Diderot’s use of rhetorical tropes in philosophical and scientific texts were often criticized by his contemporaries, as there was no sufficient vocabulary to describe this style at the time. The paper claims that the analysis of how literary, philosophical, and scientific discourses interact in texts of the 18th century shows what the contemporary debate on style was about.&#x0D;

As the precursor of the Enlightenment, Descartes creates the general logic of the Enlightenment project: the everyday self does not exist for the order of certainty but forms part of the enterprise. The everyday self is an absence in the strict ordo cognoscendi, but it forms the necessary margin of reliable thinking. If the everyday self exists on the margin, then its reconstruction needs the hermeneutics of margins: it needs to be elicited from scribbled notes. One can see why John Carriero thinks that in Descartes there is no articulated and systematic theory of an everyday relation to the world. In contrast to Carriero, this paper points out the systematic presence of the everyday self in Descartes. It argues that the everyday self is not only a constitutive exterior to the quest for certainty but rather a determining element in the order of certainty. The paper claims that the everyday self is not a secondary figure in Descartes’ philosophy but a starting point on the surface of the texts.&#x0D;

Williams reflect on one of the most persistent and controversial themes in the intellectual history of US foreign policy: American exceptionalism. But the exceptionalism under investigation here is not the familiar account inspired by a mixture of early modern Puritan theology and nineteenth century expansionist myths of Manifest Destiny. Rather, their main concern is with a second strain of exceptionalism that took shape during the first half of the twentieth century, in response to a series of political crises triggered by a variety of phenomena such as the rise of mass society, bureaucratization, atomization, secularization, social differentiation and changes in modes of economic production. In this later form, what is exceptional was the ability of American institutions to cope with the political, economic and socio-cultural challenges that led to the backlash against liberal modernization in European states during the 1930s and 1940s. The main thesis that the authors then proceed to develop is that the origins and evolution of the American realist tradition must be re-interpreted in the context of this second exceptionalist moment in US history."

The author thus studies Paine’s “democratic style”, for which he was harshly criticised, as being part and parcel of his inherently republican and democratic radicalism. She argues that in his writings Paine sought to deconstruct the discourse of the political elite of his time, associated with the trappings of royalty, and promoted the language of common sense instead as an instrument of resistance predicated on the universality of human nature. He invented a radical linguistics whereby he wished to go back to the roots of words."

Yeats and particularly his philosophical reading and explorations of older systems of thought, where philosophy, mysticism, and the supernatural blend. It opens with a broad survey of the current state of Yeats scholarship and examination of Yeats’s poetic practice through a manuscript that shows the original core of a poem that became a work of philosophical thought and occult lore, “The Phases of the Moon.” The following essay examines an area where spiritualism, eugenic theory, and criminology cross paths in the writings of Cesare Lombroso, and Yeats’s response to his work. The third paper considers Yeats’s debts to the East, especially Buddhist and Hindu thought, while the fourth looks at his ideas about the dream-state, the nature of reality, and contact with the dead. The fifth essay explores Yeats’s understanding of the concept of the Great Year from classical astronomy and philosophy, and its role in the system of his work A Vision, and the sixth paper studies that work’s theory of “contemporaneous periods” affecting each other across history in the light of Oswald Spengler’s The Decline of the West. The seventh essay evaluates Yeats’s reading of Berkeley and his critics’ appreciation (or lack of it) of how he responds to Berkeley’s idealism. The book as a whole explores how Yeats’s mind and thought relate to his poetry, drama, and prose, and how his reading informs all of them."

This paper presents modern application of fire safety engineering (FSE) in the shaping of civil engineering development. Presented scientific achievements of FSE become tools used in typical modern engineering workflow. Experience gained through successful implementations of these solutions is then further crafted into prescriptive laws that shape future fire safety. This diffusion of knowledge is limited by law requirements themselves, technical limitations, and yet unresolved challenges that are still being worked on by the researchers in this field. This paper aims to present the achievements of the FSE discipline that may and should be used by civil engineers and other participants of the building process. Explanations given for the choices of fire safety engineers allow a better understanding of their gravity by representatives of other engineering branches. That way it is possible to build empathy between different engineering disciplines, which may significantly improve both the building design process and safety of the buildings itself. The chosen framework of this paper is Appendix A to EU Construction Products Regulation defining basic goals for a fire safe building, with a possible application of FSE given for each of these goals. The current framework of performance-based FSE is presented in relation to the Polish legal system, with recommendations on how to improve both FSE and civil engineering in the future."

Although the philosophical and aesthetic importance of Yeats’s mystical work has recently received serious attention, notably in W.B.Yeats’s A Vision: Explications and Contexts, the models used to recuperate and reassess this aspect of Yeats’s have not so far included minor contemporary figures like Lombroso, but have rather focused on classical, idealist, or political philosophy. Lombroso’s view of different human types, expressed most powerfully in his studies on genius and criminality, Criminal Man (1876) and The Man of Genius (1891), are important influences to consider for Yeats’s portrayal of representative psychological types in his typology of the phases of the Great Wheel. Beyond A Vision, Yeats’s reading of Lombroso connects with his interests in crime, eugenics, psychoanalysis, predestination, and the occult in his theater, for example, in his late play ‘Purgatory’, which is discussed in detail."

If the idea of a self-governing polis requires that citizens maintain a set of social bonds, then the threat to social bonds also threatens the possibility of self-rule. Freud identifies a destructive impulse or drive as part of the human psyche, clarifying that it has the specific capacity to destroy social bonds. This chapter considers the importance of ambivalence as a permanent feature of love relations and those social relations that form the basis of political life. It argues that a political effort to counter destruction must call upon the resources of melancholia, including the manic refusal of tyranny and a normalizing reality principle. Defending the idea of militant pacifism, the argument here suggests that aggression can be—and must be—part of the strategy against violence and the sustainable future of political life."

It focuses on their answers to, first, the analytical questions of how lying is to be defined and whether lying involves an intent to deceive, and second, the moral questions of why lying is morally wrong and whether lying is morally worse than other forms of deception. Although their answers to these questions are closely related, it treats them separately. The overall conclusion is that there is much disagreement about the correct answers."

10.1163/182539187x00042,THE HERITAGE OF DUGALD STEWART: OXFORD PHILOSOPHY AND THE METHOD OF POLITICAL ECONOMY,"Abstracttitle RIASSUNTO /title  L'articolo esamina il dibattito sulla metodologia dell'economia politica che anim i circoli intellettuali anglicani degli inizi del diciannovesimo secolo. Ad Oxford, l'approccio all'economia politica era fortemente condizionato dalla riflessione critica sulle proposte epistemologiche avanzate da Dugald Stewart nel suo Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind. I pensatori dell'Oriel College che presero parte al dibattito erano preoccupati dal processo di rapida trasformazione della societ inglese, e dall'emergere di fonti di autorit culturale indipendenti dalla, se non apertamente contrarie alla Chiesa Anglicana ed alle Universit. La discussione della metodologia dell'economia politica investiva dunque diversi aspetti della vita sociale ed intellettuale del tempo.  Il dibattito oxoniense ruotava intorno al parallelismo che molti credevano di notare tra il metodo della meccanica razionale e quello dell'economia politica. Pur avallando le pretese di scientificit avanzate dagli economisti classici, i docenti di Oxford negavano che i risultati ottenuti in economia politica fossero immediatamente applicabili alla realt sociale: al pari dei cultori della meccanica razionale, l'economista doveva tenere presenti le frizioni generate dalle esistenti strutture politiche e sociali.  A Cambridge, William Whewell e Richard Jones valutavano con preoccupazione la difesa dell'economia politica elaborata dai colleghi di Oxford. A loro avviso, gli studiosi dell'Oriel College concedevano troppo all'economia politica ricardiana. Alla fine degli anni venti del diciannovesimo secolo, gli intellettuali cantabrigensi sottoposero a critica severa il preteso parallelismo tra meccanica razionale ed economia politica che i seguaci di Ricardo e i ?CTRLerr type=""1"" mess=""Doute Cars isoles avec recollage"" ?docenti di Oxford ponevano al centro delle loro riflessioni. L'economia politica, si diceva a Cambridge, era una disciplina troppo giovane per poter assumere procedure assiomatico-deduttive. Laboriose ricerche erano ancora da intraprendere, prima che si potesse procedere alla costruzione di un sistema di economia teorica.  Il presente saggio sottolinea la centralit di Dugald Stewart nel dibattito sulla metodologia dell'economia politica dei primi decenni del diciannovesimo secolo. Si sostiene inoltre che la lettura critica delle tesi epistemologiche avanzate dallo Stewart rappresent un momento cruciale nella elaborazione della metodologia dell'economia politica proposta da John Stuart Mill. I risultati di questo studio impongono una revisione delle interpretazioni classiche dei dibattiti filosofici e culturali in genere del primo Ottocento inglese.

10.1163/18253911-02801003,Training Tennis Players through Natural Philosophy: From Scaino’s Trattato to Garsault’s Art du paumier,"The motion of tennis balls has always been taken as a particularly interesting example of the complexity of the laws of motion. In this essay I survey the historical and cultural background of the use of the tennis ball as a scientific example of motion and its laws from the late Italian Renaissance onwards. I have examined in particular Antonio Scaino’s Trattato del giuco della palla (1555) and its scientific sources. Scaino’s effort to provide his readers with a scientific explanation of various tennis shots inspired the authors of other texts on sports to adopt an approach that combined science and leisure activities. However, the mysterious irregular trajectory of the tennis ball remained unexplained until 1852 when the German physicist Heinrich Gustav Magnus demonstrated mathematically how the action of air was the cause of the variation in motion of projectiles."

10.21273/horttech.10.2.287,Teaching Integrated Pest Management Using the Learn-by-Doing Philosophy,"California Polytechnic State University's (Cal Poly) learn-by-doing philosophy permeates all areas of the environmental horticultural science curriculum by combining an emphasis on the science of horticulture in lecture sessions and the opportunity to engage in activities similar to those used by industry in the lab activities integral in all courses. The course, Disease and Pest Control Systems in Ornamental Plants (EHS 427), has taken this philosophy a step further by using problem-based learning and allowing students to function as pest control advisors and qualified applicators in the class. This approach has resulted in greatly increased student understanding of pest control, improved student morale, and increased interest in integrated pest management careers and research projects."
10.1332/policypress/9781447331476.003.0002,Framing fatherhood: the ethics and philosophy of researching fatherhoods,"This chapter offers a reflection on some of the interconnected philosophical, ethical and methodological challenges that have arisen in the research on fatherhood and in response to scholarly engagements with fatherhood research. The case for research funding may be easier to make if the proposed research addresses a clear area of need and/or addresses issues in vulnerable populations. If there is resistance to fatherhood research, then, it is potentially influenced by the idea that fathers, as men, are already relatively advantaged, both socially and economically — and research that benefits an already advantaged group may be less important than research that benefits a more disadvantaged group. This depends, however, on who the putative beneficiaries of fatherhood research are."
10.21273/horttech.5.2.175,Toward a Philosophy for Capstone Courses in Horticulture,"Capstone courses generally target undergraduate students who are nearing completion of their studies. They are designed to build on skills acquired in earlier courses and emphasize situations and challenges that exist in the real world. Specific learning goals and course objectives vary across disciplines and institutions, but most capstone courses provide an opportunity for students to demonstrate a range of professional competencies and communication skills. By incorporating computer simulations, case studies, or research projects, students are better able to develop critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, a learning goal frequently adopted following curriculum review. A brief overview of the development, current popularity, and widespread offering of university capstone courses is presented. The goals and organization of `Quality, Ethics, and the Global Environment,” the capstone course in the horticulture major at Ohio State Univ., is compared to other capstone courses."
10.4102/phcfm.v8i1.1292,Should we use philosophy to teach clinical communication skills?,"Effective communication between the doctor and patient is crucial for good quality health care. Yet, this form of communication is often problematic, which may lead to several negative consequences for both patients and doctors. Clinical communication skills have become important components of medical training programmes. The traditional approach is to teach students particular communication skills, such as listening to patients and asking open-ended questions. Despite their importance, such training approaches do not seem to be enough to deliver medical practitioners who are able and committed to communicate effectively with patients. This might be due to the pervasive negative influence of the medical profession’s (mistaken) understanding of itself as a natural science on doctor–patient communication. Doctors who have been trained according to a positivist framework may consider their only responsibility to be the physical treatment of physical disorders. They may thus have little regard for the patient’s psychological and social world and by extension for communication with the patient and/or their caregivers. To address this problem, I propose a curriculum, based on the academic field of philosophy, for teaching clinical communication."
10.1017/s175297191700001x,The conduct of history in International Relations: rethinking philosophy of history in IR theory,"IR scholars have made increasingly sophisticated use of historical analysis in the last two decades. To do so, they have appealed to theories or philosophies of history, tacitly or explicitly. However, the plurality of approaches to these theories has gone largely unsystematized. Nor have their implications been compared. Such historical–theoretic orientations concern the ‘problem of history’: the theoretical question of how to make the facts of the past coherently intelligible. We aim to make these assumptions explicit, and to contrast them systematically. In so doing, we show theories of history are necessary: IR-theoretic research unavoidably has tacit or overt historical–theoretic commitments. We locate the field’s current historical commitments in a typology, along two axes. Theories of history may be either familiar to the observer or unfamiliar. They may also be linear, having a long-term trajectory, nonlinear, lacking such directionality, or multilinear, proceeding along multiple trajectories. This comparative exercise both excavates the field’s sometimes-obscured commitments and shows some IR theorists unexpectedly share commitments, while others unexpectedly do not. We argue that better awareness of historical–theoretic reasoning, embedded in all IR uses and invocations of history, may encourage the discipline become more genuinely plural."
10.3126/ejdi.v23i1-2.19066,Economic Interpretation of Philosophy of Bhagavad Gita: A Descriptive Analysis,"Bhagavad Gita has proposed number of economic principles and values. In his recent book, The Idea of Justice, Amartya Sen discusses main massage of the Bhagavat Gita that is ‘duty is important’. In addition to this, the central thesis of the Gita from the philosophical view is found through the concept of yoga. The path of action without motive (or the path of Niskam Karma Yoga) is the most important of those various principles. The path of knowledge (Gyan Yoga) and the path of commitment to work (Bhakti Yoga) are other important principles. Bhagavad Gita analyses in detail the behavioral nature of different individuals and the result of the behavior of the individual. It emphasizes on the good moral character and considers labour as the duty of each and every individual. Similarly it describes about the qualities of life and the happiness of people. Self-reliance of the individual is also emphasized in the Bhagavad Gita. Full commitment to fulfill ones assigned task makes the task successfully accomplished even if people do not care about the fruit (returns from it) before doing the task. Doubts and continuous eye in the fruit work may divert the attention of the actor from the work to the fruit only. Full concentration in the work is necessary to make the work fully successful. The concepts of sustainable development and human development also have their roots in the Bhagavad Gita. Economic Journal of Development Issues Vol. 23&amp;24 No. 1-2, (2017) Combined Issue, Page : 77-101"

Institutional changes to university, we called as universitization, that occurred in State Islamic Higher Education (SIHE/PTKIN) can not be separated from the philosophy that surrounds it. Learning from the experience of Universitas Islam Negeri Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang, as one of the IAIN that changed its institutional status from State Islamic College (SIC/STAIN) into the State Islamic University (SIU/UIN) can be reconstructed based on philosophy which became the foundation of the institutional change policy. The study found that the basic ideas are the universality of Islam, the philosophy of tarbiyah ulul albab, and the integration of science. The philosophy of institutional change can not be separated from the long history of reform thinking in Islam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
10.1192/s000712500029658x,Evaluative Delusions: Their Significance for Philosophy and Psychiatry,"The significance of delusions for psychiatry is well recognised. Scientifically respectable, delusions are reliably identifiable clinically (Wing et al, 1974), widely acknowledged across diverse cultural norms as genuine symptoms of illness (Wing, 1978), and central to the historical notion of insanity (Jaspers, 1913). What is not so well recognised, however, is that delusions are also highly significant for philosophy. This is not well recognised either by philosophers or by doctors. Yet the key to recognising it lies not in some obscure philosophical analysis of delusions but in a feature of their everyday clinical phenomenology."
10.23943/princeton/9780691157184.001.0001,Philosophy before the Greeks,"There is a growing recognition that philosophy isn’t unique to the West, that it didn’t begin only with the classical Greeks, and that Greek philosophy was influenced by Near Eastern traditions. Yet even today there is a widespread assumption that what came before the Greeks was “before philosophy.” This book presents a groundbreaking argument that, for three millennia before the Greeks, one Near Eastern people had a rich and sophisticated tradition of philosophy fully worthy of the name. In the first century BC, the Greek historian Diodorus of Sicily praised the Babylonians for their devotion to philosophy. Showing the justice of Diodorus’s comment, this is the first book to argue that there were Babylonian philosophers and that they studied knowledge systematically using a coherent system of logic rooted in the practices of cuneiform script. The book uncovers Babylonian approaches to knowledge in three areas: the study of language, which in its analysis of the written word formed the basis of all logic; the art of divination, which interpreted communications between gods and humans; and the rules of law, which confirmed that royal justice was founded on truth. The result is an innovative intellectual history of the ancient Near Eastern world during the many centuries in which Babylonian philosophers inspired scholars throughout the region—until the first millennium BC, when the breakdown of this cosmopolitan system enabled others, including the Greeks, to develop alternative methods of philosophical reasoning."
10.23943/princeton/9780691158617.001.0001,Confucian Perfectionism,"Since the very beginning, Confucianism has been troubled by a serious gap between its political ideals and the reality of societal circumstances. Contemporary Confucians must develop a viable method of governance that can retain the spirit of the Confucian ideal while tackling problems arising from nonideal modern situations. The best way to meet this challenge, this book argues, is to adopt liberal democratic institutions that are shaped by the Confucian conception of the good rather than the liberal conception of the right. The book examines and reconstructs both Confucian political thought and liberal democratic institutions, blending them to form a new Confucian political philosophy. The book decouples liberal democratic institutions from their popular liberal philosophical foundations in fundamental moral rights, such as popular sovereignty, political equality, and individual sovereignty. Instead, it grounds them on Confucian principles and redefines their roles and functions, thus mixing Confucianism with liberal democratic institutions in a way that strengthens both. The book then explores the implications of this new yet traditional political philosophy for fundamental issues in modern politics, including authority, democracy, human rights, civil liberties, and social justice. The book critically reconfigures the Confucian political philosophy of the classical period for the contemporary era."
10.23943/princeton/9780691160726.001.0001,Analytic Philosophy in America,"This collection of recent and unpublished essays traces milestones in the field of analytic philosophy from its beginnings in Britain and Germany in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, through its subsequent growth in the United States, up to its present as the world’s most vigorous philosophical tradition. The central chapter chronicles how analytic philosophy developed in the United States out of American pragmatism, the impact of European visitors and immigrants, the mid-century transformation of the Harvard philosophy department, and the rapid spread of the analytic approach that followed. Another chapter explains the methodology guiding analytic philosophy, from the logicism of Frege and Russell through Wittgenstein’s linguistic turn and Carnap’s vision of replacing metaphysics with philosophy of science. Further chapters review advances in logic and the philosophy of mathematics that laid the foundation for a rigorous, scientific study of language, meaning, and information. Other chapters discuss W. V. O. Quine, David K. Lewis, Saul Kripke, the Frege–Russell analysis of quantification, Russell’s attempt to eliminate sets with his “no class theory,” and the Quine–Carnap dispute over meaning and ontology. The book then turns to topics at the frontier of philosophy of language. The final chapters, combining philosophy of language and law, advance a sophisticated originalist theory of interpretation and apply it to U.S. constitutional rulings about due process."
10.23943/princeton/9780691148700.001.0001,"On the Currency of Egalitarian Justice, and Other Essays in Political Philosophy","G. A. Cohen was one of the most gifted, influential, and progressive voices in contemporary political philosophy. At the time of his death in 2009, he had plans to bring together a number of his most significant papers. This is the first of three volumes to realize those plans. Drawing on three decades of work, it contains previously uncollected articles that have shaped many of the central debates in political philosophy, as well as papers published here for the first time. In these pieces, Cohen asks what egalitarians have most reason to equalize, he considers the relationship between freedom and property, and he reflects upon ideal theory and political practice. Included here are classic essays such as “Equality of What?” and “Capitalism, Freedom, and the Proletariat,” along with more recent contributions such as “Fairness and Legitimacy in Justice,” “Freedom and Money,” and the previously unpublished “How to Do Political Philosophy.” On ample display throughout are the clarity, rigor, conviction, and wit for which Cohen was renowned. Together, these essays demonstrate how his work provides a powerful account of liberty and equality to the left of Ronald Dworkin, John Rawls, Amartya Sen, and Isaiah Berlin."
10.23943/princeton/9780691138664.001.0001,Philosophy of Language,"This book presents a unifying vision of the field of philosophy of language—its principal achievements, its most pressing current questions, and its most promising future directions. In addition to explaining the progress philosophers have made toward creating a theoretical framework for the study of language, the book investigates foundational concepts—such as truth, reference, and meaning—that are central to the philosophy of language and important to philosophy as a whole. The first part of the book describes how philosophers from Frege, Russell, Tarski, and Carnap to Kripke, Kaplan, and Montague developed precise techniques for understanding the languages of logic and mathematics, and how these techniques have been refined and extended to the study of natural human languages. The book then builds on this account, exploring new thinking about propositions, possibility, and the relationship between meaning, assertion, and other aspects of language use. An invaluable overview of the philosophy of language by one of its most important practitioners, this book will be essential reading for all serious students of philosophy."
10.23943/princeton/9780691153643.001.0001,"Nature, Human Nature, and Human Difference","People have always been xenophobic, but an explicit philosophical and scientific view of human racial difference only began to emerge during the modern period. Why and how did this happen? Surveying a range of philosophical and natural-scientific texts, dating from the Spanish Renaissance to the German Enlightenment, this book charts the evolution of the modern concept of race and shows that natural philosophy, particularly efforts to taxonomize and to order nature, played a crucial role. The book demonstrates how the denial of moral equality between Europeans and non-Europeans resulted from converging philosophical and scientific developments, including a declining belief in human nature's universality and the rise of biological classification. The racial typing of human beings grew from the need to understand humanity within an all-encompassing system of nature, alongside plants, minerals, primates, and other animals. While racial difference as seen through science did not arise in order to justify the enslavement of people, it became a rationalization and buttress for the practices of trans-Atlantic slavery. From the work of François Bernier to G. W. Leibniz, Immanuel Kant, and others, the book delves into philosophy's part in the legacy and damages of modern racism. With a broad narrative stretching over two centuries, the book takes a critical historical look at how the racial categories that we divide ourselves into came into being."
10.23943/princeton/9780691149004.001.0001,Lectures on the History of Moral and Political Philosophy,"G. A. Cohen was one of the leading political philosophers of recent times. He first came to wide attention in 1978 with the prize-winning book Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence. In subsequent decades his published writings largely turned away from the history of philosophy, focusing instead on equality, freedom, and justice. However, throughout his career he regularly lectured on a wide range of moral and political philosophers of the past. This volume collects these previously unpublished lectures. Starting with a chapter centered on Plato, but also discussing the pre-Socratics as well as Aristotle, the book moves to social contract theory as discussed by Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and David Hume, and then continues with chapters on Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, and Friedrich Nietzsche. The book also contains some previously published but uncollected papers on Marx, Hobbes, and Kant, among other figures. The collection concludes with a memoir of Cohen written by the volume editor who was a student of Cohen's. A hallmark of the lectures is Cohen's engagement with the thinkers he discusses. Rather than simply trying to render their thought accessible to the modern reader, he tests whether their arguments and positions are clear, sound, and free from contradiction. Ultimately, his lectures teach us not only about some of the great thinkers in the history of moral and political philosophy, but also about one of the great thinkers of our time: Cohen himself."
10.23943/princeton/9780691159232.001.0001,Genealogy of the Tragic,"Why did Greek tragedy and “the tragic” come to be seen as essential to conceptions of modernity? And how has this belief affected modern understandings of Greek drama? This book answers these and related questions by tracing the emergence of the modern theory of the tragic, which was first developed around 1800 by thinkers associated with German Idealism. The book argues that the idea of the tragic arose in response to a new consciousness of history in the late eighteenth century, which spurred theorists to see Greek tragedy as both a unique, historically remote form and a timeless literary genre full of meaning for the present. The book offers a new interpretation of the theories of Schiller, Schelling, Hegel, Hölderlin, and others, as mediations between these historicizing and universalizing impulses, and shows the roots of their approaches in earlier discussions of Greek tragedy in Germany, France, and England. By examining eighteenth-century readings of tragedy and the interactions between idealist thinkers in detail, the book offers the most comprehensive historical account of the tragic to date, as well as the fullest explanation of why and how the idea was used to make sense of modernity. It argues that idealist theories remain fundamental to contemporary interpretations of Greek tragedy, and calls for a renewed engagement with philosophical questions in criticism of tragedy."
10.23943/princeton/9780691138602.001.0001,Pursuits of Wisdom,"This is a major reinterpretation of ancient philosophy that recovers the long Greek and Roman tradition of philosophy as a complete way of life—and not simply an intellectual discipline. The book traces how, for many ancient thinkers, philosophy was not just to be studied or even used to solve particular practical problems. Rather, philosophy—not just ethics but even logic and physical theory—was literally to be lived. Yet there was great disagreement about how to live philosophically: philosophy was not one but many, mutually opposed, ways of life. Examining this tradition from its establishment by Socrates in the fifth century BCE through Plotinus in the third century CE and the eclipse of pagan philosophy by Christianity, the book examines six central philosophies of living: Socratic, Aristotelian, Stoic, Epicurean, Skeptic, and the Platonist life of late antiquity. The book describes the shared assumptions that allowed these thinkers to conceive of their philosophies as ways of life, as well as the distinctive ideas that led them to widely different conclusions about the best human life. Clearing up many common misperceptions and simplifications, the book explains in detail the Socratic devotion to philosophical discussion about human nature, human life, and human good; the Aristotelian focus on the true place of humans within the total system of the natural world; the Stoic commitment to dutifully accepting Zeus's plans; the Epicurean pursuit of pleasure through tranquil activities that exercise perception, thought, and feeling; the Skeptical eschewal of all critical reasoning in forming their beliefs; and, finally, the late Platonist emphasis on spiritual concerns and the eternal realm of Being."
10.23943/princeton/9780691163093.001.0001,After Hegel,"Histories of German philosophy in the nineteenth century typically focus on its first half—when Hegel, idealism, and Romanticism dominated. By contrast, the remainder of the century, after Hegel's death, has been relatively neglected because it has been seen as a period of stagnation and decline. This book argues that the second half of the century was in fact one of the most revolutionary periods in modern philosophy because the nature of philosophy itself was up for grabs and the very absence of certainty led to creativity and the start of a new era. This innovative concise history of German philosophy, from 1840 to 1900, focuses not on themes or individual thinkers but rather on the period's five great debates: the identity crisis of philosophy, the materialism controversy, the methods and limits of history, the pessimism controversy, and the Ignorabimusstreit. Schopenhauer and Wilhelm Dilthey play important roles in these controversies but so do many neglected figures, including Ludwig Büchner, Eugen Dühring, Eduard von Hartmann, Julius Fraunstaedt, Hermann Lotze, Adolf Trendelenburg, and two women, Agnes Taubert and Olga Pluemacher, who have been completely forgotten in histories of philosophy. The result is a wide-ranging, original, and surprising new account of German philosophy in the critical period between Hegel and the twentieth century."
10.23943/princeton/9780691167190.001.0001,A Short History of German Philosophy,"This book provides an original history of German-language philosophy from the Middle Ages to today. In an accessible narrative that explains complex ideas in clear language, the book traces the evolution of German philosophy and describes its central influence on other aspects of German culture, including literature, politics, and science. Starting with the medieval mystic Meister Eckhart, the book addresses the philosophical changes brought about by Luther's Reformation, and then presents a detailed account of the classical age of German philosophy, including the work of Leibniz and Kant; the rise of a new form of humanities in Lessing, Hamann, Herder, and Schiller; the early Romantics; and the Idealists Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. The following chapters investigate the collapse of the German synthesis in Schopenhauer, Feuerbach, Marx, and Nietzsche. Turning to the twentieth century, the book explores the rise of analytical philosophy in Frege and the Vienna and Berlin circles; the foundation of the historical sciences in Neo-Kantianism and Dilthey; Husserl's phenomenology and its radical alteration by Heidegger; the Nazi philosophers Gehlen and Schmitt; and the main West German philosophers, including Gadamer, Jonas, and those of the two Frankfurt schools. Arguing that there was a distinctive German philosophical tradition from the mid-eighteenth century to the mid-twentieth century, the book closes by examining why that tradition largely ended in the decades after World War II."
10.23943/princeton/9780691157047.003.0001,"On the Muslim Question: Philosophy, Politics, and the Western Street","This introduction examines how the figure of the Muslim has become the center where questions of political philosophy and political theology, politics and ethics converge. It explains how the Muslim question has depicted Islam as the preeminent danger to politics; to Christians, Jews, and secular humanists; to women, sex, and sexuality; to the values and institutions of the Enlightenment. It considers how liberty, equality, and fraternity become not imperatives but questions in relation to Muslims and Islam. It argues that European states—indeed all the states of the liberal and social democratic West—are faced with continuing questions about their commitment to democracy and about the status of women, sexuality, equality and difference, faith and secularism."
10.1017/s0034670518000931,War by Other Means? Incentives for Power Seekers in Thomas Hobbes's Political Philosophy,"AbstractThe problem of the power seeker is of crucial importance for Hobbes's political philosophy. While education might aid in changing the behavior of some people, Hobbes is clear that there are limits to the effectiveness of education and that incurable, unsocial power seekers will persist. In my analysis, I ask whether and, if so, how Hobbes can also get these incurable power seekers on board. The result of my findings that Hobbes provides a huge variety of treatments for power seekers, including incentives to betray and exploit their fellow citizens by employing a public gesture of civility, has implications for Hobbes research: it shows the complexity and costs of Hobbes's “solution” to the problem of war and corrects a widespread developmental hypothesis about the concept of honor in Hobbes's works. Thereby, it can also enrich a recent diagnosis about the decline of honor in modern societies."
10.23943/princeton/9780691135106.003.0008,Weimar Philosophy and the Crisis of Historical Thinking,"This chapter addresses the philosophy of history and the so-called crisis of historicism. For proponents of the Weimar “crisis theology,” the breakdown of historical norms and values had led to a “permanent Krisis of the relation between time and eternity.” In this void “between the times” the work of Spengler, Barth, and Gogarten came to signify a “crisis of historicism”: not merely of the empirical research paradigm of practicing historians, but rather a crisis in the foundations of historical thinking, of Nietzsche's question about whether history itself has any meaning for life. It is this crisis that came to shape German historical thinking in decisive ways during the Weimar era, especially in the work of four philosophers of history: Oswald Spengler, Ernst Troeltsch, Heinrich Rickert, and Martin Heidegger."
10.23943/princeton/9780691160726.003.0001,Analytic Philosophy in America,"This chapter traces the development of analytic philosophy in the United States, starting with the pragmatism of Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and (later) Clarence Irving Lewis, and continuing through the great immigration of philosophers of science, philosophical logicians, and logical positivists from the turn of the twentieth century to the outbreak of World War II. It also provides broad-brush overviews of some of the most important philosophical debates that occupied American analytic philosophers during the last half of the twentieth century, including the Quine–Carnap debate about meaning and analyticity, the struggle over modality, the rise of philosophical logic and its application to the study of natural language, the Davidsonian program, Saul Kripke and the end of the linguistic turn, John Rawls and the resuscitation of normative theory, and a smattering of other, more specialized topics."
10.23943/princeton/9780691148403.003.0009,Hobbes’s Political Philosophy,"This chapter examines some questions in Thomas Hobbes's political philosophy, with the objective of identifying what, if anything, Hobbes thought to be the central problem, or problems, of politics. It links these questions to an account of why the state of nature is so intolerable, of how we may leave it, and whether the manner of our leaving is well explained by Hobbes. The chapter also considers the implications for Hobbes's account of the rights and duties of the sovereign, along with the contentious issue of the subject's right, in extremis, to reject his sovereign and rebel. Finally, it analyzes Hobbes's account of the nature of punishment, his conception of the law of nature, his theory of political obligation, the role (or lack of a role) of religious belief in his political system, and his views on liberty."
10.23943/princeton/9780691160726.003.0005,The Place of Willard Van Orman Quine in Analytic Philosophy,"This chapter discusses the achievements of W. V. O. Quine and his place in analytic philosophy. It begins with Carnap’s logical empiricism, which set the context for Quine’s first major article in philosophy, “Truth by Convention” (1935). It explains both Quine’s largely effective critique of analyticity and the problems that plagued his combination of holistic verificationism with an underdetermination thesis that paired each consistent empirical theory T with alternative theories logically incompatible with, but empirically equivalent to, T. It discusses the impetus for Quine’s movement from his critique of analyticity to his later doctrines of the Indeterminacy of Translation and the Inscrutability of Reference. The chapter closes with an explication of these radical doctrines, the role played by Quine’s physicalism, and his ineluctable march to a so-called radical and self-undermining semantic eliminativism."
10.23943/princeton/9780691171906.003.0005,"Religion, Philosophy, and the Absolute","This chapter focuses on Hegel's concept of absolute spirit, which refers to the collection of norms and practices in which spirit has itself for an object—the norms and practices in and through which the members of the community create, sustain, and transform spirit itself. This view of Hegel's concept of absolute spirit has both epistemological and ethical implications. It suggests that the standard of knowledge against which people's beliefs, actions, and norms are judged emerges from the social practices of the people who share a form of life. It also suggests that among these social practices ought to be rituals and other shared activities in which people recognize one another's authority and accountability."
10.23943/princeton/9780691138602.003.0003,Aristotle,"This chapter discusses the Aristotelian way of life. For Aristotle, philosophy is not a way of life, as it was for Socrates. It is two distinct ones. Aristotle's contemplatives are, of course, complete philosophers. They lead lives of practical virtue in just the way other private citizens who possess those virtues in full measure do. The contemplative is both a philosopher of human affairs and a theoretical philosopher. Contemplatives live their philosophy in a double way. Still, the life they lead is correctly called a contemplative one, not one of practical virtue. It is one of the two ways that for Aristotle philosophy is a way of life. But for those “philosophers of human affairs”—virtuous political leaders, fully virtuous ordinary citizens—who are not also accomplished theoretical philosophers, philosophy is nonetheless just as much their way of life. The thinking and analysis and systematic argument, and systematically organized understanding, that belong to philosophy as a whole, both practical and theoretical, as its defining and distinctive characteristic, are engaged and expressed in all the thoughts that give rise to and direct all the choices, actions, and activities constituting the whole of their lives."
10.23943/princeton/9780691151489.003.0006,"“The Sciences of the Ancients”: Speculation on the Origins of Philosophy, Medicine, and the Exact Sciences","This chapter discusses the attempts to explain the origins of science, philosophy, and medicine. In classical Greece, medicine and philosophy were held to be Greek inventions, whereas the mathematical, or exact, sciences were believed to have originated in the ancient Near East, usually Egypt or Babylon. In the Hellenistic and Roman periods, the “barbarian” nations also laid claim to medicine and philosophy, with some Greek and Roman agreement. Jews in particular focused on philosophy when advancing their claims to civilizational priority rather than laying claim to the other sciences or civilization in general. This was for at least two reasons. First, soon after Alexander's conquests, Greeks promulgated the image of Jews as a philosophical race; when Greek and Roman authors later started to portray Jews as misanthropic outsiders, Jewish scholars sought to reinforce the earlier positive, transconfessional image. Second, once the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek, Greek-speaking Jews could read their scriptures and note parallels with Greek philosophy."
10.23943/princeton/9780691167190.003.0013,Is Philosophy Partly to Blame for the German Catastrophe? Heidegger between Fundamental Ontology and History of Being,"This chapter considers the question of why German culture is responsible for what are probably the most atrocious crimes of the modern age. It suggests that anyone who wants to answer the question as to why so many Germans followed Hitler would do well to distinguish three levels of followers. First, there was a relatively small minority that supported the National Socialist policy of annihilation out of deep conviction. Second, there was a large group that did not approve of mass murder as a political means, but in 1933 was willing to bring to power a government from which every kind of brutality could be expected, so long as it could be hoped that it would make Germany strong again. Third, there was a large number of people who did not vote for Hitler, but nonetheless obeyed him, not only because they did not want to take any risks, but also because they were convinced that they owed obedience to the legal government."
10.23943/princeton/9780691153322.003.0003,The Gift of Philosophy,"This chapter examines Cicero’s claims about the political content of his philosophical writings and their potential benefit to the future of the state. Drawing on two of his treatises, the preface to book one of Tusculan Disputations and the preface to book one of De Finibus, the chapter considers what Cicero repeatedly identifies as his project’s major contribution: the act of translating philosophy from the Greek and making it accessible in Latin. It also explores the cultural and political meaning of translation as an act of patriotism, as well as Cicero’s response to the difficulties of presenting works in translation to an audience with a variety of often opposing cultural objectives and prejudices."
10.29173/cmplct17983,Educating far from Equilibrium: Chaos Philosophy and the Quest for Complexity in Education,"It would be futile, John Dewey argued in 1902, to think that we have to choose between child-centered, progressive education and traditional, subject-matter-oriented approaches. Calling for adaptivity, he stressed that we need the act of balancing the one with the other. The tendency in current educational policy to lean in favor of traditional, disciplinary modes of control appears to lose sight of this need. The aim of this paper is to reconnect to the task of maintaining a balance between educational freedom and structure, using a variety of theoretical resources such as complexity science, and the philosophies of Deleuze and Guattari, Schiller, and Nietzsche. Based on these resources, the authors also discuss Steiner Waldorf education as an example of how educational practice may approach, and integrate the significance of chaos in the form of a “virtual pedagogy”."
10.23943/princeton/9780691135106.003.0007,Weimar Philosophy and the Fate of Neo-Kantianism,"This chapter explains the decline of neo-Kantianism. In a polemically revisionist account of this major intellectual movement, it casts neo-Kantians as somewhat less than benevolent purveyors of pacifism and cosmopolitanism, explaining how long-simmering cultural and philosophical traditions of pessimism and nihilism ultimately displaced the authoritative role of genuinely Kantian themes in their writings. It shows that the old story told about the fate of neo-Kantianism during the Weimar years—that it represented the path of reason, that it was the sensible via media between the extremes of right and left, that it was murdered by irrationalist fanatics— is a myth. It is philosophically problematic because neo-Kantianism could not effectively justify the democratic and moral values of the Weimar Constitution. And it is historically inaccurate, because the great reaction against neo-Kantianism arose less because of its support for Weimar than because of its support for the Great War."
10.23943/princeton/9780691148700.003.0013,How To Do Political Philosophy,"This chapter argues that is impossible to explain to anybody how philosophy is to be done. The only way to teach people how to do it is by letting them watch, and listen, and imitate. The least charitable explanation of the self-same fact is that because those who have learned how to do philosophy struggled so hard to get where they are, they are selfishly reluctant to share some of the fruits of their struggle for free: they think that others, too, should suffer. There may be some truth in each explanation. But however all that may be, Cohen gives some tips about how to do philosophy. After giving these preliminary tips about how to do philosophy in general, he turns to some tips about political philosophy in particular."
10.23943/princeton/9780691163093.003.0002,The Identity Crisis of Philosophy,"This chapter discusses the “identity crisis” suffered by philosophers beginning in the 1840s, the decade after Hegel's death. They could no longer define their discipline in the traditional terms widely accepted in the first decades of the nineteenth century. So they began to ask themselves some very hard questions. What is philosophy? What is its purpose? And how does it differ from the empirical sciences? The remainder of the chapter covers the sources of the crisis, Trendelenburg's philosophia perennis, philosophy as critique, Schopenhauer's revival of metaphysics, the rise and fall of the neo-Kantian ideal, Eduard von Hartmann's metaphysics of the sciences, and Wilhelm Dilthey's conception of philosophy as a worldview."
10.23943/princeton/9780691167190.003.0001,Does German Philosophy Have a History? And Has There Ever Been a “German Spirit”?,"This chapter first sets out the book's purpose, which is to provide a brief survey of German philosophy and thereby to bring out peculiarities that distinguish this philosophy from those of other European nations. The book shows that reflection on the concept of Geist (spirit) is a crucial part of the German spirit. Despite all the changes in German philosophy, plausible lines of development will be made clear; without them, a history really cannot be written. The chapter then explains the reasons why it makes sense to produce a new account of the history of German philosophy at the beginning of a century that will no longer be a European one."
10.23943/princeton/9780691167190.003.0014,National Socialist Anthropology and Political Philosophy: Arnold Gehlen and Carl Schmitt,"This chapter focuses on Arnold Gehlen (1904–1976) and Carl Schmitt (1888–1985). Gehlen's Der Mensch. Seine Natur und seine Stellung in der Welt (“Man, His Nature and Place in the World,” 1940), may be the most important philosophical book published under the Third Reich. The book concentrates on the peculiar mode of being of a finite, rational being that knows it is finite: an obvious subject when belief in God has ceased while at the same time a thirst for reality prevails that is not satisfied by the subtle foundational ideas of Frege and Husserl. Schmitt was one of the most important political thinkers of the past century, despite his moral repulsiveness. This was evident in his inability to feel remorse after the war, his mawkish self-pity regarding his own fate (he was a potential defendant in the Nuremberg trials until Robert Kempner decided against arraigning him), his complete lack of sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust, and indeed the ostentatious display of his Catholicism, with whose ethical core his original political ideas were in the most blatant contradiction."
10.23943/princeton/9780691155333.003.0004,A Summary of the Philosophy of Contract,"This chapter discusses the main streams of contract philosophy in order to elucidate the extent to which boilerplate is a permissible means of creating contractual obligation. In particular, it considers the deep embeddedness—the ineradicability—of the notion of voluntariness. It also compares and contrasts the economic efficiency theory of contract with the various theories based more directly on freedom of the will. The chapter first provides an overview of contract theory, focusing on autonomy (rights) and welfare theories, reliance theory, and equivalence of exchange theory. It then describes the basic premises of the economic theory of law, the role of incentives in maximizing social welfare, contract law, and property and liability rules. It shows that the existing philosophical theories of contract depend on the core notions of voluntariness, freedom of choice, or consent, thus making it difficult to incorporate boilerplate into the theories of contract."
10.23943/princeton/9780691133645.003.0022,The New Public Philosophy,"This chapter considers the Reagan presidency and the dilemma faced by powerful groups that controlled American politics. The dilemma is that the program for change rested upon a public philosophy different from, even antithetical to, the one on which Reagan campaigned. Within a few short months, the new administration initiated a far-reaching program of spending cuts, tax changes, deregulation, and reduced social services that completely turned on its head the campaign rhetoric quoted earlier. “Problems of flesh and blood” were sacrificed to “abstract economic theory,” causing “pain” and destroying “the moral fiber” of real people."
10.23943/princeton/9780691172279.003.0005,The Generation of Art as the Generation of Philosophy,"This chapter studies how early modern thinkers understood the connection between the generation of art and the generation of philosophical understanding. It argues that in this period, the generation of mental representations was understood through practices of artistic production, and that the notion of generation itself was central to philosophy. The first section explores descriptions of cognition that compare thinking to the creation of artistic works. It discusses the accounts of a broad range of artists and scholars, including Dürer and Willibald Pirckheimer (1470–1530), Bosse and Girard Desargues (1591–1661), Descartes, and others to show how constant the association between artistic generation and mental generation was in this period. The second section examines the celebrated frontispiece to the Leviathan that Bosse created in collaboration with Hobbes. It argues that previous accounts of the frontispiece have failed to capture the full complexity of this etching. It offers a new account of this famous image — one that emphasizes the process of the state's generation."
10.23943/princeton/9780691153322.003.0002,On a More Personal Note,"This chapter examines the reasons for Cicero’s project that he sets forth, paratactically, in the prefaces by focusing on the references to philosophy, writing, and intellectual life that are found in his letters. It first considers Cicero’s belief in the ability of philosophy to influence and improve people’s characters and actions—a belief implicit in the politically motivated goals that he cites in the prefaces. It then explores how Cicero constructs the link between philosophy and politics, along with his representation of philosophy, and writing more generally, in relation to the traditional division of elite activities between the spheres of otium and negotium. It also discusses the issue of philosophy as consolation and the notion that Cicero’s grief for Tullia motivated his philosophical writings."
10.23943/princeton/9780691160726.003.0003,"Language, Meaning, and Information","This chapter is a case study of the process by which the attempt to solve philosophical problems sometimes leads to the birth of new domains of scientific inquiry. It traces how advances in logic and the philosophy of mathematics, starting with Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell, provided the foundations for what became a rigorous and scientific study of language, meaning, and information. After sketching the early stages of the story, it explains the importance of modal logic and “possible worlds semantics” in providing the foundation for the last half century of work in linguistic semantics and the philosophy of language. It argues that this foundation is insufficient to support the most urgently needed further advances. It proposes a new conception of truth-evaluable information as inherently representational cognitive acts of certain kinds. The chapter concludes by explaining how this conception of propositions can be used to illuminate the notion of truth; vindicate the connection between truth and meaning; and fulfill a central, but so far unkept, promise of possible worlds semantics."
10.23943/princeton/9780691153322.003.0006,Philosophy after Caesar,"This chapter examines the transformation in Cicero’s philosophical project following the change in his political circumstances after the death of Julius Caesar. It begins with a reading of the preface to book two of De Divinatione, Cicero’s first public reflection on the state of the project at the time of Caesar’s death. It then considers the treatises that followed, arguing for a gradually evolving new direction, along with the trajectory in Cicero’s choices of dedicatees that sheds further light into the evolution of his thinking about the place of philosophy in his overall plans. It concludes with a reading of the prefaces to the three books of the De Officiis. Whereas De Oratore and De Re Publica are dedicated to Quintus, De Officiis is dedicated to Marcus the Younger."
10.23943/princeton/9780691176321.003.0001,Scythian Philosophy,"This chapter sets out the book's purpose, which is to show not only that Pyrrho's complete package is similar to Early Buddhism, but also that the same significant parts and interconnections occur in the same way in both systems. The earliest sources on Early Pyrrhonism and Early Buddhism are examined closely, including in some cases determining what “Early” means. They show that the close parallel between Early Pyrrhonism and Early (Pre-Normative) Buddhism is systemic and motivated by the same internal logic. Pyrrho's journey to Central Asia and India with Alexander thus had an outcome for the future of philosophy that has lasted down to the present."
10.23943/princeton/9780691167190.003.0011,"The Exact Sciences as a Challenge and the Rise of Analytic Philosophy: Frege, the Viennese and Berlin Circles, Wittgenstein","This chapter discusses the emergence of a philosophical school that is now dominant in the Anglo-American world called “analytical philosophy.” The first form taken by analytic philosophy, now long since abandoned, was logical positivism or logical empiricism (the former sympathized with phenomenalism, the latter was more realistically oriented). Logical positivism's goal is a unified science modeled on physics. The intended system of constitution seeks to move from one's own mental qualities to physical objects, from these to the mental qualities of others, and finally to the objects of the social sciences. With regard to the mental qualities of others, behaviorism, which reduces the mental to externally observable behavior, is considered a scientific conception of the world."
10.23943/princeton/9780691149271.003.0006,Philosophy on the Pillow,"This chapter looks at how Louis-Sébastien Mercier returns to his liberating pillow to explain how the night favors philosophy. It is the ideal time for contemplation: suspending the frenzy of the day, it fosters the peaceful circulation of ideas. The head resting on the pillow releases a particular form of leisure, a happy provocation of consciousness. Scattered through Mercier's Bonnet de nuit are dreams or “celestial” reveries, as he calls them, meditations in which the spirit levitates, absconds from solid reality. These aerial dreams can produce flights of mind unbound by human gravity, moments of utopia wrested from social and political violence."
10.23943/princeton/9780691138602.003.0001,Introduction,"This chapter discusses ancient philosophy as a way of life. It first considers the ties linking popular ideas about philosophy to the subject of study that is pursued and taught in philosophy departments by professional philosophers. One aspect of ancient philosophy as a way of life has survived intact in philosophy until today is the prominence among philosophy's varied subfields of ethics or moral philosophy. It argues that the ancient philosophers propose that we live our lives from some set of argued through, rationally worked out, rationally grasped, and rationally defended, reasoned ideas about the world and one's own place within it. To live a life of philosophy is to live committed to following philosophical reason wherever it may lead. The promise is that by doing so—but only by doing so—one will achieve the best possible human life."
10.23943/princeton/9780691171715.003.0004,A Constraints-Based Philosophy of Mathematical Practice,"This chapter describes a constraints-based philosophy of mathematical practice and shows that mathematics can be so many different things, even if we look at a particular branch of mathematics in a particular time and place. It introduces a philosophical approach to mathematics that can serve as an integrative framework for the insights of the various philosophies of mathematics and demonstrates what kind of plurality the philosophy of mathematics must embrace, if it is to be faithful to the phenomenon that it seeks to explicate. The chapter reflects on the function of mathematical statements, consensus in mathematics, and mathematical interpretation and semiosis. It also considers various constraints that apply to mathematical practice and how they are negotiated by different mathematical cultures. Finally, it examines more mainstream notions of reality and truth of mathematical entities and statements and suggests how a takeoff on Hilary Putnam's notion of relevance might relativize them."
10.23943/princeton/9780691160726.003.0002,Methodology in Late Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy,"This chapter discusses the methodology that guided logico-linguistic analysis from Gottlob Frege’s 1879 Begriffsschrift to Rudolf Carnap’s 1934 The Logical Syntax of Language. In the first four decades of this period, culminating with Bertrand Russell’s 1918–19 lectures on The Philosophy of Logical Atomism, analysis was viewed as an increasingly powerful tool employed in the service of solving traditional philosophical problems. The logicist reduction of arithmetic to what was taken to be logic was the driving force, providing the exemplar of philosophical analysis and the model for extending it beyond the philosophy of mathematics. The methodology is indicated by the role played by A2 in answering Frege’s guiding philosophical questions Q1 and Q2."
10.23943/princeton/9780691160726.003.0006,David Lewis’s Place in Analytic Philosophy,"This chapter is devoted to one of the most fascinating figures of the twentieth century, David Lewis. The key to understanding this author of so many works in so many areas of philosophy is to see how his views are related to those of his colleague Saul Kripke as well as to those of his teacher W. V. O. Quine. Like Kripke, Lewis embraced the modalities (necessity and a priority) that Quine rejected. Also like Kripke, Lewis had no sympathy for Quine’s early verificationism or his flights from intension and intention, and he was straightforwardly a realist about science in general. However, despite these similarities with Kripke, Lewis’s analysis of necessity could not be more different from Kripke’s. Quine taught that vindicating naturalism and extensionalism required eliminating intensional facts and rejecting intensional constructions, his student Lewis, however, tried to show that intensional facts are just a species of extensional facts, and that intensional constructions in language are no threat to the integrity of an austere, naturalistic vision of reality."
10.23943/princeton/9780691159232.003.0001,Introduction,"This introductory chapter provides an overview of tragedy. Tragedy is the most philosophical of art forms. However, tragedy has not always been philosophical in the same way. Around 1800, tragedy's way of meaning underwent a major shift, with broad consequences for thought on literature and philosophy. Through the eighteenth century, tragedy had been considered primarily in rhetorical terms as a way of producing a certain emotional effect, but since 1800 it has more often been considered in speculative terms as a way of making sense of the human world. It is only since around 1800 that works of art have been considered in such philosophical and often metaphysical terms. Greek tragedy played a leading role in this development, as the foundation for elaborating a concept of “the tragic” that extended far beyond an aesthetic context, encompassing history, politics, religion, and ontology."
10.23943/princeton/9780691167190.003.0016,Why We Cannot Assume That There Will Continue to Be a German Philosophy,"This chapter argues that institutionally, there is little reason to predict a great future for German philosophy. The philosophical form of religiousness that so strongly distinguished Germany from the United States, has evaporated, presumably because sadness and shame over the twelve cursed years has crippled appropriation of the spiritual treasures of the past, which can take place only with hermeneutic reservations, for example on the occasion of the anniversaries of classics. Moreover, it is well known that German scientific institutions are not at present in the best of shape. The weaknesses of the German system have been amply discussed over the past two decades, but it is unlikely that fundamental reforms will be undertaken in the foreseeable future, because too many interests would be adversely affected."
10.23943/princeton/9780691167190.003.0003,The Change in the Philosophical Situation Brought about by the Reformation: Paracelsus’s New Natural Philosophy and the “No” in Jakob Böhme’s God,"This chapter examines the thoughts of natural philosopher Theophrastus Bombastus of Hohenheim, called Paracelsus (1493–1541), and Jakob Böhme (1575–1624). Like most of the innovative ideas of the sixteenth century, Paracelsus's philosophical-scientific ideas belong to the time of fermentation between the collapse of Scholastic science and the emergence of the new science in the seventeenth century. The polemic against traditional medicine, especially the humoral pathology that derived from books rather than from direct experience, is conducted in a churlish manner reminiscent of Luther and with bombastic self-praise. Böhme is considered first epoch-making German philosopher of the modern period. He was a cobbler who had had experienced mystical visions and wanted to provide a deeper foundation for his traditional Lutheran piety (inspired by the Bible) through a philosophical account of the development of God, nature, and redemption through Christ."
10.23943/princeton/9780691175768.003.0009,The Epistemologia Imaginabilis in Eighteenth-Century Science and Philosophy,"This chapter examines the change in science's image and the revelation of the philosophers of science's so-called epistemologia imaginabilis in the context of eighteenth-century science and philosophy. Many eminent scholars, from Thomas Hobbes to Denis Diderot, have engaged in the epistemological debate over extending the methods of the natural sciences to the study of human experience. The idea of the unity of knowledge across all disciplines on the basis of scientific methodology reached its peak with Immanuel Kant. Among the great historians, Marc Bloch was the one who best understood the role that a radically new conception of science could play in redefining and reviving the legitimacy of historical knowledge. The chapter considers the intense intellectual debate between historians of science and philosophers of science on the foundations of knowledge and how modern science acquired definitive legitimacy as a new form of knowledge over the course of the eighteenth century."
10.20944/preprints201812.0110.v1,<span>Concordant and Discordant Construct-Context Dualities as a Framework for Understanding the Choice of Vocational Educational Philosophy of Booker T. Washington</span>,"This paper explores the rationale behind Booker T. Washington&amp;rsquo;s vocationalist philosophy of education for the then recently emancipated black population.&amp;nbsp; Through the use of a critical thinking framework, an analysis of remarks from key speeches and his life according to scholars providing Washington&amp;rsquo;s prescriptive argument and rhetoric is undertaken. Despite Washington&amp;rsquo;s intentions, the argument for his vocational approach is demonstrated to be oppressive, myopic, and circular in its logic.&amp;nbsp; The author proposes a framework for understanding the counterintuitive development of vocationalist philosophy based on the dichotomous nature of the human experience&amp;rsquo;s value-construct and context misalignment.&amp;nbsp; Concordant or discordant dualities that result from misalignment are explained and how to reconcile Washington&amp;rsquo;s Vocationalism with opposing the philosophy of W.E.B. Du Bois due to equivalence or consistency of values with theoretical constructs is also discussed."
10.1017/s0031819100050014,The Question of African Philosophy,"Philosophy in Africa has for more than a decade now been dominated by the discussion of one compound question, namely, is there an African philosophy, and if there is, what is it? The first part of the question has generally been unhesitatingly answered in the affirmative. Dispute has been primarily over the second part of the question as various specimens of African philosophy presented do not seem to pass muster. Those of us who refuse to accept certain specimens as philosophy have generally been rather illogically said also to deny an affirmative answer to the first part of the question. In a paper presented at the International Symposium in Memory of Dr William Amo, the Ghanaian philosopher who taught in German universities in the early part of the eighteenth century, Professor Odera Oruka identified four trends, perhaps more appropriately approaches, in current African philosophy."
10.7551/mitpress/9780262035668.001.0001,"Philosophy, Technology, and the Environment","Environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology have taken divergent paths despite their common interest in examining human modification of the natural world. Yet philosophers from each field have a lot to contribute to the other. Environmental issues inevitably involve technologies, and technologies inevitably have environmental impacts. In this book, prominent scholars from both fields illuminate the intersections of environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology, offering the beginnings of a rich new hybrid discourse. All the contributors share the intuition that technology and the environment overlap in ways that are relevant in both philosophical and practical terms. They consider such issues as the limits of technological interventions in the natural world, whether a concern for the environment can be designed into things, how consumerism relates us to artifacts and environments, and how food and animal agriculture raise questions about both culture and nature. They discuss, among other topics, the pessimism and dystopianism shared by environmentalists, environmental philosophers, and philosophers of technology; the ethics of geoengineering and climate change; the biological analogy at the heart of industrial ecology; green products and sustainable design; and agriculture as a bridge between technology and the environment."
10.7551/mitpress/9780262035095.003.0002,"The Student of Science, Medicine, and Philosophy","By examining McCulloch’s childhood and formative years during the 1920s as a student at Yale University and Columbia University, this chapter outlines the emergence of McCulloch as a transdisciplinary investigator and a man full of paradox. McCulloch majored in philosophy at Yale and minored in psychology, and had a reputation in his graduating class of being unique and boisterous. His poetry from this period used the traditional form of the sonnet yet tackled modern themes such as science, industry, and war. These poems also align McCulloch with an idealism and longing for the “lost world” before World War I. McCulloch was trained in the laboratory culture of experimental neurology, but was also drawn to a brand of psychiatry that understood the diseased mind in terms of flaws in logic. Ultimately, McCulloch’s identities during the early part of his life transcended science, medicine, and philosophy, the hands-on and the abstract, and balanced traditional thinking with iconoclasm."
10.7551/mitpress/9780262034845.003.0001,"Definitions of Rationality in Philosophy, Cognitive Science, and Lay Discourse","Because rationality is an issue across many disciplines, it has acquired many different definitions. This chapter describes definitions of rationality from cognitive science that are amenable to a program of measuring individual differences. Definitions of both epistemic and instrumental rationality are described in terms in terms of axiomatic utility theory and probability theory. It is argued that the wide range of tasks investigated in the heuristics and biases literature captures most aspects of epistemic and instrumental rationality."
10.1017/s0307883311000733,Performance as Philosophy: Responding to the Problem of ‘Application’,"This article begins from the premise that a ‘critical turning point’ has been reached in terms of the relationship between performance and philosophy. Theatre and performance scholars are becoming increasingly engaged in philosophical discourse and there are growing amounts of work that take philosophy – from the work of Plato to Heidegger and Deleuze – as their guiding methodology for performance analysis. However, this article argues that we need to go further in questioning how we use philosophy in relation to performance, and that theatre and performance scholarship should attempt to go beyond merely applying philosophical concepts to performance ‘examples’. One way to do this, the article suggests, is by questioning the very distinction between performance and philosophy, for instance by exploring the idea of performance as philosophy. The article concludes by drawing from the work of figures such as Allan Kaprow, Henri Bergson, François Laruelle and John Mullarkey to argue that philosophers and performance scholars alike might extend their conception of what counts as thinking to include not only activities like performance, but embodied experiences and material processes of all kinds."

10.1017/s1479244318000513,AMERICAN DIVIDE: THE MAKING OF “CONTINENTAL” PHILOSOPHY,"The story of Western philosophy in the late twentieth century is, first and foremost, a tale of the discipline's division into two distinct discourses—analytic and Continental philosophy. This article argues that institutional dynamics of American higher education played a decisive role in the creation of this divide. Through quantitative analysis of the hiring and promotion of philosophers, it demonstrates how hierarchies and informal academic networks established boundaries for mainstream American philosophy that excluded modern European thought. Following the end of World War II, as American universities expanded, philosophy departments nearly tripled in size. However, the discipline was dominated by a Brahmin caste of elite departments that hired its own graduates almost exclusively. In this environment, the invidious distinction between the “elite” analytic departments and heterodox departments at the discipline's periphery was mapped onto the styles of philosophy practiced at those schools, and shaped America's reception of “Continental” European philosophy."
10.17768/pbl.y2.n2.p287-307,"MORAL, POLITICS AND METHOD: THE INFLUENCE OF RONALD DWORKIN´S PHILOSOPHY ON THE BRAZILIAN SUPREME COURT","This article analyses the use of Ronald Dworkin’s philosophy by the Brazilian Supreme Court. After the Constitution of 1988, the Supreme Court gained a new and broader role in Brazilian political scene. At this time, the work of Ronald Dworkin (and its Brazilian editions) became popular and served as justification for four of the most important cases on the Supreme Court: the fidelity of Congresist’s members on their Political Party; the permission of embryonic stem cells research; the unconstitutionality of press regulation; and the homosexual civil union. Dworkin’s philosophy is a part of the changing-role of the Supreme Court in Brazil. This article offers a demonstration of the use of this philosopher in this in-progress process. "
10.33195/uochjrs-v1i1382017,An Academic Review of Anton LaVey’s Satanic Philosophy,"Satan has been a changing character for the last 2500 years. For most of its history, the Devil was represented as God’s archenemy, the representation of absolute evil. By the 19th Century, this approach had begun to change with the Romantics, some of whom represented a more heroic character. In the mid-20th Century, in the mist of counter-cultural movements, the figure of Satan was once again apprehended by non-conformists. The most notorious of these was Anton LaVey, who founded the Church of Satan. This article reviews LaVey’s approach to the figure of Satan, some of the rituals and symbolisms associated with this movement, and the way LaVey used Satan as a way to represent his particular philosophical views.

10.17759/langt.2018050309,"Cultural Person as a Result of the Education. From the History of the Domestic Philosophy of Education: V.V. Rozanov, S.I. Gessen, E.V. Il’enkov","The system of the education is one of the fundamental social institute which is invoked providing not only the transfer of knowledge but also the continuity and the stability of the social development. After several decades of the constant reforming Russian system of the education haven’t been adapted to the new reality of the informational civilization, neither it has achieved the harmonization between that reality and traditional values of the Russian culture. There are some trends and mental attitudes which can be traced in the history of Russian philosophical thought and can be counterposed to above-mentioned negative tendencies. These trends have manifested itself in works of such different thinkers as V.V. Rozanov, S.I. Gessen and E.V. Il’enkov, who stay in a not numerous row of those Russian thinkers who paid special attention to philosophical-educational problems. This article is an attempt to outline the domestic tradition of philosophy of education which can withstand to instrumentalist and utilitarian trends of the modern education. It is demonstrated that despite some different philosophical premises above-mentioned thinkers articulated some comparable purposes of the education – ideas of “transformation of the natural man to the cultural person” (V.V. Rozanov), “the conversion of the life to the cultural existence” (S.I. Gessen), “the formation of the totally developed person” (E.V. Il’enkov). There will be an attempt to show that the Russian thinker’s philosophical-educational conceptions not only are of historical interest but also have the potential to be an important conceptual resource for the development of the contemporary Russian society."
10.5422/fordham/9780823273669.001.0001,"Heidegger, Philosophy, and Politics","In February of 1988, philosophers Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jacques Derrida, and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe came together in Heidelberg before a large audience to discuss the philosophical and political implications of Martin Heidegger’s thought. This event took place in the very amphitheater in which, more than fifty years earlier, Heidegger, as Rector of the University of Freiburg and a member of the Nazi Party, had given a speech entitled “The University in the New Reich.” Heidegger’s involvement in Nazism has always been, and will remain, an indelible scandal, but what is its real relation to his work and thought? And what are the responsibilities of those who read this work, who analyze and elaborate this thought? Conversely, what is at stake in the wholesale dismissal of this important but compromised twentieth-century philosopher? In 1988, in the wake of the publication of Victor Farias’s Heidegger and Nazism, and of the heated debates that ensued, these questions had become more pressing than ever. The reflections presented by three of the most prominent of Heidegger’s readers, improvised in French and transcribed here, were an attempt to approach these questions before a broad public, but with a depth of knowledge and a complex sense of the questions at issue that were often lacking in the press at the time."
10.5422/fordham/9780823275977.001.0001,Kant on the Frontier,"Frontier: the border between two countries; the limits of civilization; the bounds of established knowledge; a new field of activity. At a time when all frontiers (borders, boundaries, margins, limits) are being—often violently—challenged, erased or reinforced, it might be a matter of urgency to take up and rethink the very concept of frontier itself. But is there even such a concept, to be found or constructed? That is what this book begins to cast into doubt, on the basis of a reading of Kant, for whom the frontier turns out to be both the very element of his thought and the permanent frustration of his conceptuality. Following what Kant himself would call this “guiding thread,” first in the “political” writings and then in the still little-read “Critique of teleological judgment,” I try to bring out a complex, abyssal, fractal structure, which always leaves a residue of nature—violence—in every frontier (including conceptual frontiers), and which complicates Kant’s most explicit, most rational arguments (which always tend towards cosmopolitanism and so-called perpetual peace) by adding to them an element of reticence or interruption. As it turns out that there can be perpetual peace only in death, we must interrupt the teleological movement that always might take us there, we must maintain some frontiers (and therefore a certain violence) in the very place where everything led us to believe that we should hope for their pacific disappearance, if only in the infinite perspective of the Idea of Reason. Neither critique of Kant nor return to Kant, this book also proposes a new reflection on philosophical reading, for which thinking the frontier is both an essential resource and the recurrent, fruitful, interruption."
10.5422/fordham/9780823277599.001.0001,Expectation,"This book is a major volume of the author's writings on literature, written across three decades but, for the most part, previously unavailable in English. More substantial than literary criticism, these essays collectively negotiate literature's relation to philosophy. The author pursues such questions as literature's claims to truth, the status of narrative, the relation of poetry and prose, and the unity of a book or of a text, and addresses a number of major European writers, including Dante, Sterne, Rousseau, Hölderlin, Proust, Joyce, and Blanchot. The final section offers a number of impressive pieces by the author that completely merge concerns for philosophy and literature and philosophy-as-literature. These include a lengthy parody of Valéry's “La Jeune Parque,” several original poems by the author, and a beautiful prose-poetic discourse on an installation by Italian artist Claudio Parmiggiani that incorporates the Faust theme. The book constitutes the most substantial statement to date by one of today's leading philosophers on a discipline that has been central to his work across his career."
10.5422/fordham/9780823279500.001.0001,Eco-Deconstruction,"This book launches a new mode of philosophical and ethical reflection with respect to the challenges posed by the degradation of the natural environment. While the work of French philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930–2004), with its relentless interrogation of the anthropocentric metaphysics of presence, has already proven highly influential in posthumanism and animal studies, the present volume builds on these insights in addressing the most pressing environmental issues of our time. The volume brings together fifteen scholars from a wide variety of related fields, including eco-phenomenology, eco-hermeneutics, new materialism, posthumanism, animal studies, science and technology studies, environmental humanities, eco-criticism, earth art, and analytic environmental ethics. Overall, eco-deconstruction offers an account of differential relationality explored in an ecological context, both quasi-ontologically and quasi-normatively, with attention to diagnosing our times. Accordingly, the book is divided into four sections—Diagnosing the Present, which suggests that our times are marked by a flattened-out understanding of time and thus in need of deconstructive dispositions; Ecologies, which mobilizes the spectral ontology of deconstruction to argue for the constitutive ecological embeddedness of mortal life; Nuclear and Other Biodegradabilities, in which contributors reflect on the remains and by-products of human culture, including nuclear waste and species extinctions; and Environmental Ethics, which uncovers a demand for justice that emerges as a response to original differentiation and the mortality and alterity it installs in living beings. As such, the book may resonate with readers not only in philosophy, but across the humanities and the social and natural sciences."
10.5422/fordham/9780823270408.003.0002,Philosophy to Its Limit,"This chapter argues that in doing “philosophy to its limit” there will always be the residue of the body as there will be a Chaos and Tohu-Bohu. So, we can head toward the limit of the phenomenon as we make our way to the threshold of a bodying life capable of engendering what is in our true humanity. Paul Ricoeur underlines that “each work responds to a determinate challenge”—a notion that could very well describe the relation to the author's previous books of what he undertakes here. “And what connects it to its predecessors seems to be less the steady development of a unique project than the acknowledgement of a residue left over by the previous work, a residue which gives rise in turn to a new challenge”."
10.5422/fordham/9780823273010.003.0005,Heidegger and Kierkegaard,"First published in 1932/1933, Wahl’s article laid the groundwork for the anthropological, humanist reading of Heidegger by showing how Heidegger’s philosophy must be seen as an attempt to ontologize and secularize Kierkegaard’s more religiously-tinged thought. At the same time, and thanks precisely to Heidegger’s philosophy, it revealed that Kierkegaard was a serious philosophical thinker in his own right. Wahl’s essay also stands out for being at once a succinct, admirable overview of Heidegger’s early philosophy and a penetrating critique of issues still debated by Heidegger scholars today. Finally, in characteristic style, we see Wahl bringing thinkers into dialogue over the most fundamental issues. In this essay alone, there are more than just passing remarks on Nietzsche, Jaspers, Bergson, and Hegel."
10.5422/fordham/9780823273010.003.0006,The Problem of Choice,"First published in 1934 in Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale and later republished with minor revisions in Études kierkegaardiennes, this extended discussion of Karl Jaspers’s three-volume Philosophie (1932) was among the first to address Jaspers’s work in France. While ranging widely over Jaspers’s three volumes, this essay is also strangely personal, addressing those topics in Jaspers’s work that most matter to Wahl: the question of choice, being in a situation, the limited, fragmented, and tragic character of existence. Wahl makes a point of drawing a distinction, one not always recognized, between philosophers of existence like Jaspers and Heidegger and existential philosophers like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. While not always agreeing with Jaspers, Wahl nevertheless recognizes that Jaspers’s thought is “situated in a place where some of the most eternal and most real philosophical problems are located.”"

Beck’s Cognitive Therapy (CT) and Albert Ellis’ Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) are compared. A major difference between these therapies is that CT is an empirically based therapy and REBT is philosophically based. The origins and subsequent development of the therapies are reviewed with this difference highlighted. Comparisons between CT and REBT practice are made regarding attitudes toward client beliefs, use of guided discovery, types of cognition addressed, and the nature of the client-therapist relationship. The scientific foundations of CT are summarized in terms of the specificity of its conceptual models, the construction of targeted treatment protocols, and empirical findings that support both CT conceptualizations and treatments."
10.31425/0042-8795-2018-5-282-297,The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner by James Hogg. <i> An English gothic novel in the context of moral philosophy<i>,"The article is concerned with the unique ethical and aesthetic features of gothic fiction between the 18th and 19th centuries, and its representation in James Hogg’s novel The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner. Lofty ideals in the novels by A. Radcliff, M. G. Lewis, and C. Maturin often showed strong ties with moral philosophy (its concepts of benevolence, sin as the opposite of freedom, and sense and sensibility as the sources of virtue), permeating 18th-century discussions about morality along with reflections on the elevated and the picturesque. On the artistic plane of the gothic novel, these ideas create two principal oppositions, corresponding to ethical and aesthetic levels: ‘the natural and the unnatural’, and ‘freedom and non-freedom’. They are also present in Hogg’s novel, although represented in a different way. While the ‘natural/unnatural’ dichotomy is mostly a matter of changing the angle for the story’s perception (so that the reader might follow the events from the viewpoint of the pursuer rather than the pursued), though not without interesting aesthetic derivatives, the ‘freedom/non-freedom’ opposition marks a more modern aesthetical transition from the outside world to a fictional one."
10.12987/yale/9780300175233.003.0004,Roman Philosophy and the Jews,"This chapter details how Philo integrates the Jews into his philosophical treatises, which are of lively interest in Rome, where they had been discussed since Cicero. The Jews are moreover inscribed into contemporary discourses and presented as philosophers who live by both their ancestral tradition and the values of Roman Stoicism. The Jews are distinguished now from the Greeks and described by Roman notions. Indeed, Philo has speedily integrated into Roman culture, which he encountered during the embassy, and shown an exceptional intellectual curiosity. Philo's achievement is impressive, as he offers the first extant Roman interpretation of Judaism. Moreover, Philo's philosophy in his later treatises has implications for early Christianity, which turns in the mid-second century to philosophy in a Roman mode."
10.12987/yale/9780300196511.003.0003,Franz Boas in Africana Philosophy,"This chapter discusses how Franz Boas's contributions to Africana thought make him an Africana thinker. Boas's arguments ultimately showed the error in making whites the standard for all other groups. While European societies produced their standards of how to live as a human being, the error is to conclude that theirs were and continue to be the standards or, worse, the only ones. In stream with many Africana thinkers, Boas addressed the question of whether people rendered homeless in the world that created them “belong,” so to speak, to the story of humankind. Although they were rejected by European modernity, there was no legitimate reason for them to be denied their membership in the human community. Boas's historicism was, in other words, a form of redemptive history, one linked to a conception of freedom as also a portrait of belonging."
10.2307/2939045,Rawls's “Political” Philosophy and American Democracy.,"John Rawls has recently argued that political philosophy can significantly contribute to making democratic societies stable. He seeks moral principles that can ground what he calls anoverlapping consensusand argues that his well-known principles of justice can serve in this capacity. I criticize both Rawls's general claims about the role of political philosophy and his particular defense of the principles of justice. Both arguments commit Rawls to specific empirical claims about existing liberal societies that are highly questionable. In particular, the Kantian moral views that Rawls believes to be central to liberal culture are controverted by extensive empirical research on the actual beliefs of liberal citizens. Despite the problems with Rawls's arguments, I suggest that a rather different overlapping consensus appears to contribute to stable democracies. This centers on support of the political system rather than more substantive moral principles."
10.21313/hawaii/9780824858780.001.0001,Women and Buddhist Philosophy,"How and why do women engage with Buddhist philosophy? This is the fundamental question that Women and Buddhist Philosophy: Engaging Zen Master Kim Iryŏp proposes to answer through discussions of Kim Iryŏp’s (1896–1971) life and philosophy. With her Christian background and feminist activist perspective, Kim Iryŏp offers a creative interpretation of Buddhist philosophy as a system of thought that engages with lived experience. Continuing to focus on gender discrimination, suffering, and discontent in the secular world, Iryŏp explores the Buddhist teaching of absolute equality, in which individuals are conceived as free beings with infinite capability. She employs Buddhism to answer her existential questions, including the scope of identity, the meaning of being human, and the ultimate value of existence. Moving beyond current Buddhist scholarship on gender, Women and Buddhist Philosophy asks whether women’s way of engaging with Buddhist philosophy, in particular, and philosophy, in general, differs essentially from the familiar patriarchal mode of philosophizing. The author claims that in Iryŏp’s engagement with Buddhist philosophy, the difference is visible and can be identified with narrative philosophy and lived experience, as opposed to abstraction and theorization. This distinction, the author suggests, is also applicable to the difference between Asian and Western philosophies."
10.21313/hawaii/9780824866617.001.0001,The Fractal Self,"“The Fractal Self” traces fresh insights on the evolution of the universe from the Big Bang to sociobiology and human culture. The book posits that on every scale, complex structure and function and ultimately life itself arose by virtue of the power of cooperation between self and other. Cooperation has proved a catalytic force for complexity from organic molecules to human affairs, and appears to oscillate with competition, as yin with yang. However, progressive complexity emerging from antecedent simplicity consistently has come from cooperation, writ large. This is a tendency in our universe that we have called the cooperative constant; cooperation appears to have held a small average edge over competition to engender richness and diversity in nature and culture. The book further explores the human potential of achieving a seminal state of being in the world as a fractal self: any person drawn to some walk-of-life, a vocation or avocation, and who begins to realize a seamless participatory ethos as a “natural” or an “adept.” With growing sensitivity, adaptation, understanding and expertise, this self tends to develop a capacity to foster creative complexity. Insights from primatology as well as ancient myth and philosophy, especially Daoism and Buddhism, enrich our understanding regarding the emergence of empathy and morality and their applications vis`a vis nature and society. The book concludes with a new definition of free will and a hopeful vision for Gaian sustainability as our species transcends tribalism and entrains itself in partnership with nature."
10.21313/hawaii/9780824858780.003.0008,A Life Lived,"Chapter 7 aims to identify the nature of women’s Buddhist philosophy. Iryŏp’s approach to Buddhism also directs us to different dimensions in which women encounter Buddhist philosophy, which is identified as narrative philosophy, philosophy of life, based on lived experience. By examining Kim Iryŏp’s life and philosophy as a paradigmatic example of women’s philosophy in connection with Buddhism, this chapter brings attention to the way women engage with Buddhism and philosophy and offers a way of philosophizing that challenges the male dominated and Western philosophy based mode of philosophizing."
10.1093/oso/9780198829294.003.0009,"Kant, Wolff, and the Method of Philosophy","Both in his pre-critical writings and in his critical works, Kant criticizes the Wolffian tradition for its use of the mathematical method in philosophy. The chapter argues that the apparent unambiguousness of this opposition between Kant and Wolff notwithstanding, the problem of ascertaining the relationship between Kant’s and Wolff’s methods in philosophy cannot be dismissed so quickly. Only a close consideration of Kant’s different remarks on Wolff’s approach and a comparison of the methods that Wolff and Kant actually used in philosophy can allow us to determine when Kant’s criticisms are justified and where the differences in their methodological proposals for philosophy actually lie. We see that Kant’s account of philosophical method in fact has some elements in common with the Wolffian paradigm, even though there are also relevant differences."
10.1093/oso/9780190844073.003.0006,Conspiracy Theories and Philosophy,"There has been a recent spate of academic work concerning these things called conspiracy theories. Part of that debate concerns the apparent irrationality of belief in conspiracy theories. I argue that what is missing in the literature is a fulsome analysis of how we define what counts as a conspiracy theory. It turns out that many of our working definitions of conspiracy theory are at odds with one another. The consequence of this definitional diversity is unfortunate for the academic project at large, as—as I will demonstrate—not all definitions of conspiracy theory turn out to be equal. Looking at a broadly representative set of contemporary academic work on conspiracy theories, I argue that we scholars of conspiracy theory often skew the results of our research programs by working with problematic definitions. This can be demonstrated by showing how often the problems associated with belief in conspiracy theories are the result of scholars working with—wittingly or unwittingly—definitions of what counts as a conspiracy theory that presuppose their irrationality. As such, much work on belief in conspiracy theories begs the question. However, there is an easy solution to this endemic problem: we can choose to work with a simple, non-pejorative definition—one which happens to be championed in philosophy—which, in turn, allows us to get to the heart of the question of whether belief in conspiracy theories is, in some sense, problematic."
10.1093/oso/9780190908904.003.0004,Philosophy of Motion,"This chapter provides a definition of the philosophy motion and a review of the history of the ontology of motion. It contrasts the ontology of motion with the ontology of becoming found in other theorists. It puts forward a definition and direction for a new ontology of motion. The philosophy of motion is defined as the analysis of phenomena across social, aesthetic, scientific, and ontological domains from the perspective of motion. The historical precursors of this ontology are discussed, and an abbreviated history of the main ideas and contributions of three major philosophers of motion (Lucretius, Marx, and Bergson) is provided."
10.1093/oso/9780198829690.003.0006,"Logic, Rhetoric, and Philosophy","This chapter examines the process by which Hobbes, in the 1630s and early 1640s, began to establish a strong contrast between eloquence on the one hand and the procedure he terms ‘logic’ on the other. It argues that the contrast did not involve a wholesale rejection of rhetoric, but was, rather, an attempt to point up the necessity for philosophical discovery of the new logic Hobbes was currently attempting to develop. There was, for Hobbes, nothing wrong with rhetoric as such; the problem lay in philosophy, which he saw as having failed to produce certain knowledge (scientia) because of its reliance on the procedures of rhetorical argumentation (in particular, the enthymeme). The chapter argues for the significance, in his philosophical development, of Hobbes’s search for certain knowledge of ethics through close study of Aristotle’s account of the passions in the second book of his Rhetoric."
10.1093/oso/9780198829690.001.0001,"Philosophy, Rhetoric, and Thomas Hobbes","Hobbes claimed to have founded the discipline of civil philosophy (political science). The claim did not go uncontested, and in recent years the relationship of philosophical reasoning to rhetorical persuasion in Hobbes’s work has become a significant area of discussion, as scholars attempt to align his disparaging remarks about rhetoric with his dazzling practice of it in works like Leviathan. The dominant view is that, having rejected an early commitment to humanism and with it rhetoric when he adopted the ‘scientific’ approach to philosophy in the late 1630s, Hobbes later came to re-embrace it, as an essential aid to or part of philosophy. This book proposes that Hobbes was, from first to last, dubious about the place of rhetoric in civil society, and came to see it as a pernicious presence within philosophy—a position from which he did not retreat. Through attention to his years as a country-house tutor, the book offers a fresh and expanded picture of Hobbes’s humanism. It examines his teaching, and his translation of Thucydides; traces the influence on him of Bacon, and establishes the range of his early natural historical and philosophical interests; and it demonstrates the distinctively Aristotelian character of his understanding of rhetoric. The book re-examines the new approach to philosophy Hobbes adopted at the end of the 1630s, clarifying the nature and scope of his concern about the contamination of philosophy and political life by the procedures of rhetorical argumentation. And it reconsiders the place of rhetoric in Leviathan."
10.1093/oso/9780190913151.003.0007,Science and Philosophy,"Contemporary analytic philosophy is dominated by metaphilosophical naturalism, the view that philosophy ought to be in some sense continuous with science. According to contemporary naturalists, we cannot study the nature of mind, knowledge, language, meaning, and reality without taking into account the results from physics, linguistics, and the cognitive sciences. This chapter examines Quine’s evolving views on the relation between science and philosophy in 1950s and 1960s. Scrutinizing both the development of and the external responses to Word and Object, it examines how Quine became increasingly aware of the metaphilosophical implications of the views he had first developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In the final sections, this chapter offers a detailed reconstruction of Quine’s decision to label his position “naturalism.”"
10.1093/oso/9780199609222.003.0002,What Political Philosophy Should Learn from Economics about Taxation,"The modern economics literature provides three approaches to the analysis of taxation: one focused on the optimal balancing of a variety of normative considerations, a second focused on the relationship between taxation and (democratic) political processes, and a third focused on the possibility of constitutional limitations on the power to tax. This chapter outlines each of these approaches before discussing their compatibility and their implications for a more general normative political philosophy of taxation. It is argued that any coherent account of taxation in political philosophy should account for its non-ideal nature and draw on elements of all three economic approaches."
10.1093/oso/9780198829294.001.0001,"Oxford Studies in Early Modern Philosophy, Volume VIII","
                  Oxford Studies in Early Modern Philosophy is an annual series, presenting a selection of the best current work in the history of early modern philosophy. It focuses on the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—the extraordinary period of intellectual flourishing that begins, roughly, with Descartes and his contemporaries and ends with Kant. It also publishes work on thinkers or movements outside of that framework, provided they are important in illuminating early modern thought. The core of the subject matter is philosophy and its history. But the volume’s chapters reflect the fact that philosophy in the early modern period was much broader in its scope than it is currently taken to be and included a great deal of what now belongs to the natural sciences. Furthermore, philosophy in the period was closely connected with other disciplines, such as theology, and with larger questions of social, political, and religious history. Volume 8 includes chapters dedicated to a wide set of topics in the philosophies of Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke, Leibniz, Wolff, and Kant."
10.7312/columbia/9780231171953.003.0008,A Petty Pedagogy?,"Haddad examines the work done by pedagogy in the Foucault-Derrida debate, and argue that it reflects and reinforces the differences between the two thinkers' understandings of philosophy and its teaching. Haddad begins with Derrida's Cogito essay, analyzing two key moments in which pedagogy appears. In the first, the famous introduction where Derrida reflects on having been a student of Foucault, a traditional conception of the teacher-student relation is advanced. This conception remains at work in the essay's second pedagogic moment, when Derrida reads Descartes' first Meditation as addressed to a naïve non-philosopher being inducted into the discipline. However, this relation is simultaneously called into question by the rest of Derrida's reading, since, even as he elevates the status of philosophy, he ends up implying that it resists being taught. This reflects, Haddad argues, Derrida's own ambiguous relation to philosophy as an academic discipline."
10.7312/columbia/9780231171953.003.0004,Must Philosophy Be Obligatory?,"Michel Foucault's first reply to Jacques Derrida's 1964 critique of the first edition of the former's 1961 book on madness was published in a somewhat obscure Japanese journal in 1972, and later formed the basis for Foucault's more widely-circulated reply in “My Body, This Paper, This Fire” which was included as an appendix to the 1972 edition of the book. The more obscure first reply offers a version of the fierce textual demonstrations with which Foucault sought to rebuke Derrida in the more official reply published as an appendix. But the first reply begins with a methodological preliminary that did not make its way as such into the more widely-read reply. Foucault's reply at a methodological level focuses not so much on the lack of correctness of Derrida's interpretation of Descartes as on the lack of specificity of Derrida's classically philosophical argument against Foucault. In short, Foucault replies with historical specificity to Derrida's philosophical generality, or at least situates the debate on that level. What is at stake methodologically, not only for Foucault and Derrida but also for us today, in the difference between a philosophy that is resolutely historical and a philosophy that is not? Foucault's reply to Derrida invites us to this question, and in so doing invites a patient reconsideration of Foucault's own (not always self-conscious) methodological intervention."
10.7312/columbia/9780231178600.003.0003,Dai Zhen’s Choice Between Philosophy and Philology,This study examines philosophy (moral principles) and philology (evidential investigation) as the two basic constituent elements in Dai’s system of Confucian learning. It shows that for Dai his philology and his philosophy were inseparable. His philosophy is seen as an inevitable outgrowth of his philology and his philology was close to the Confucian Dao and thus necessary to a correct understanding of Confucian moral philosophy.
10.7312/columbia/9780231178761.003.0004,Philosophy and the Intimate Universal,"Chapter 3 asks how the intimate universal might have a significant bearing on the practice of philosophy itself. Many immediately think of philosophers as the high priests of the universal, but these high priests do not always convince non-philosophers, be they artists or religious believers. if sometimes the philosophers demand from the intimacies of religion and art that they prove themselves in connection with the universal, here the call is directed to philosophy itself, as a practice of truth, to prove that its service of the universal is in the spirit of the most intimate truthfulness. To this end, Desmond connects the philosophical service of the universal with a more intimate sense of “doing justice” that is prior to the more usual juxtaposition of theory and practice."
10.7312/columbia/9780231171953.003.0012,The Truth About Parrhēsia,"In his 1982-3 course at the Collège de France, Le gouvernement de soi et des autres, Foucault, developing his famous notion of parrhēsia (free speech, courageous speech, or “fearless speech”), is led on several occasions to make allusive but acerbic criticisms of Derrida’s readings of Plato. Starting from a symptomatic reading of the animus evident in these criticisms, Bennington shows that Foucault’s notion of parrhēsia as a guiding figure for philosophy is in fact incoherent, and that this incoherence can be related to a number of other incoherencies in Foucault’s thinking from early to late. These incoherencies arise most notably whenever Foucault attempts to address the (“transcendental”) question of the very possibility of what he claims to be doing in his work. Taking seriously Derrida’s objections to Foucault in “Cogito et histoire de la folie,” “Etre juste avec Freud,” and La bête et le souverain I, Bennington goes on to suggest that Foucault’s very inability to explain the possibility of what he is claiming to do (in brief, the absence of any plausible account of the question of reading in his work) has paradoxically been the ground of his enormous intellectual success, but that that success has been bought at the price of a historicism and a self-righteous moralism that inevitably undermine the very “political” relevance that Foucault and his followers claim for themselves."
10.7312/columbia/9780231177665.003.0002,Shen Dao’s Political Philosophy,"Builds up a picture of Shen Dao’s political philosophy by focusing on his analyses of the source, nature, and justification of political organization and order. I argue that his thought can only be understood by first coming to an understanding of his conception of the natural realm and how and why he believes that it is essential to model the social and political realm upon this natural realm. This understanding of nature only gets us so far, however, and must be coupled with a deeper awareness of human dispositions, primary among them that people act based on their own private interests, their strengths and abilities vary, and feelings of resentment and expectation arise when decisions are regarded as subjective.

10.3390/philosophies4010001,The Coming Emptiness: On the Meaning of the Emptiness of the Universe in Natural Philosophy,"The cosmological relevance of emptiness—that is, space without bodies—is not yet sufficiently appreciated in natural philosophy. This paper addresses two aspects of cosmic emptiness from the perspective of natural philosophy: the distances to the stars in the closer cosmic environment and the expansion of space as a result of the accelerated expansion of the universe. Both aspects will be discussed from both a historical and a systematic perspective. Emptiness can be interpreted as “coming” in a two-fold sense: whereas in the past, knowledge of emptiness, as it were, came to human beings, in the future, it is coming, insofar as its relevance in the cosmos will increase. The longer and more closely emptiness was studied since the beginning of modernity, the larger became the spaces over which it was found to extend. From a systematic perspective, I will show with regard to the closer cosmic environment that the Earth may be separated from the perhaps habitable planets of other stars by an emptiness that is inimical to life and cannot be traversed by humans. This assumption is a result of the discussion of the constraints and possibilities of interstellar space travel as defined by the known natural laws and technical means. With the accelerated expansion of the universe, the distances to other galaxies (outside of the so-called Local Group) are increasing. According to the current standard model of cosmology and assuming that the acceleration will remain constant, in the distant future, this expansion will lead first to a substantial change in the epistemic conditions of cosmological knowledge and finally to the completion of the cosmic emptiness and of its relevance, respectively. Imagining the postulated completely empty last state leads human thought to the very limits of what is conceivable."

In this article, the authors report on an empirical study surveying Canadian provincial and territorial judges on common scenarios which raise the possibility of recusal. Situated in the applicable case law, the findings demonstrate a wide divergence of opinion on substance and procedure among respondents in their attitudes toward recusal in situations that are analytically marginal, but not rare. The article concludes with some possible explanations for the divergence."
10.29173/alr1286,"Through the Looking Glass: Mediator Conceptions of Philosophy, Process and Power","While a number of civil reforms using mediation emerged across Canada in recent years, of particular interest is the Ontario Mandatory Mediation Program Mediation Program that was first piloted in 1999, deemed successful and then made a permanent feature of the Rules of Civil Procedure in 2001. This article suggests that before we can evaluate the outcomes of mandatory mediation, we must first look more closely at the process being implemented by the mediators in this context. With that in mind, this article considers the ways in which the mediators themselves perceive of the mediation process. It reports on a qualitative study that examined the nature of mediator views on the topics of, inter alia, settlement orientation and 
 mediator power. This article advances the claim that mediator power Is, in fact, far greater than that held by the disputants or their advocates. This article suggests that this power, in the context of a mandatory mediation scheme, creates mediator self-interest in achieving high rates of settlement, regardless of whether or not settlement is in the best interests of the disputants in every situation."

There is a problem of the national question here because ethnicity, corruption, disobedience to law and order, disdain for the rule of law and accountability and the disregard for the value of human life have undermined the social order and eventually created an army of the vulnerable and marginal peoples that can be manipulated for parochial ends. The apparent underperformance of the various instruments of the state such as the police, national assembly, appointed ministers, law courts, prisons, etc, due to inefficiency, injustice, under-funding, politicization and social dissatisfaction have threatened the unity of Nigeria and highlighted deficits in the social order that have made Nigeria to appear as a contested construct or category. Given the above we seek a philosophical approach to building a social system or social philosophy of national integration."
10.1075/pc.13.3.07has,"Robotics, philosophy and the problems of autonomy","Robotics can be seen as a cognitive technology, assisting us in understanding various aspects of autonomy. In this paper I will investigate a difference between the interpretations of autonomy that exist within robotics and philosophy. Based on a brief review of some historical developments I suggest that within robotics a technical interpretation of autonomy arose, related to the independent performance of tasks. This interpretation is far removed from philosophical analyses of autonomy focusing on the capacity to choose goals for oneself. This difference in interpretation precludes a straightforward debate between philosophers and roboticists about the autonomy of artificial and organic creatures. In order to narrow the gap I will identify a third problem of autonomy, related to the issue of what makes one’s goals genuinely one’s own. I will suggest that it is the body, and the ongoing attempt to maintain its stability, that makes goals belong to the system. This issue could function as a suitable focal point for a debate in which work in robotics can be related to issues in philosophy. Such a debate could contribute to a growing awareness of the way in which our bodies matter to our autonomy."

This paper reports the results of a study investigating the effects of playing an educational video game on students’ knowledge of Galileo’s life and times, the nature of scientific evidence, and Aristotle’s and Galileo’s views of the cosmos. In the game, students were immersed in a computer simulation of 16th century Venice where they interacted with an avatar of Galileo and other characters. Over a period of two weeks, 71 undergraduates were exposed to lectures about Galileo and the Copernican revolution in a traditional classroom setting. However, only half of the students (i.e., experimental group) also played the game. The other half (i.e., control group) were only exposed to lectures. The knowledge of both groups was assessed at the beginning (i.e., pre-test) and end (i.e., post-test) of the two-week period. The results demonstrated objective improvements in knowledge for the experimental group while the control group showed virtually no change. Implications of these findings for teaching and learning the history and philosophy of science are discussed."

It focuses on Émilie Du Châtelet’s considerations of space and time against the background of Leibniz’s program of analysis situs. Historians have characterized philosophical controversies on space and time as a dichotomy between the absolute and relational concepts of space and time. In response to this, the present case study pursues two aims: First, it shows that the common portrayal simplifies the complex pattern of change and the semantic shift from absolute-relational concepts of space and time to invariance and conservation principles. Second, against this background, I present the Online Reading Guide on Émilie Du Châtelet’s Foundations of Physics, a teaching and research project designed to help navigate Du Châtelet’s Institutions physiques (1740/42). This project makes Du Châtelet’s important text visible to a broad audience and allows for a more critical and deeper view on classical topics of the history of philosophy and science in a more accessible way than traditional introductions."
10.24234/wisdom.v11i2.214,Philosophy and methodology of definitions of history,"This article suggests a complex unity of definitions of history which should serve for the elucidation of the essence and true adequacy of the science of history to its design. Our general conception of history is based on the works of Father of Armenian’s History Movses Khorenatsi (5th century). The science of history is interpreted following our conception of “hermeneutics of wisdom” developed on the basis of H.-G. Gadamer’s “philosophical hermeneutics” which specificity I have already explicated as “hermeneutics of truth” in my monograph “Hans-Georg Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneutics”. In this article, the conceptual and methodological achievements of both these conceptions: “hermeneutics of truth” and – as its perfected implication – “hermeneutics of wisdom”, important for philosophy of history that is understanding of nature of history are used. In formulating definitions of history the author uses the logical-methodological instrument of the prominent Medieval Armenian philosopher David the Invincible (5th – 6th centuries). The definitions of history suggested in this paper are distributed into three main classes: separately by its subject of study, separately by its fulfillment, and jointly – by its subject of study and fulfillment. The formulated set of definitions of history should serve for a deeper understanding of Movses Khorenatsi’s heritage as well as for adequately revealing the truth of “being-of-history as such”."

10.3126/jpan.v3i3.11836,Existential Psychology & Buddha Philosophy: It's Relevance in Nurturing a Healthy Mind,"The term ""existentialism"" have been coined by the French philosopher Gabriel Marcel in the mid-1940s and adopted by Jean-Paul Sartre. The label has been applied retrospectively to philosophers like Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers and Søren Kierkegaard and other 19th and 20th century philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences, generally held that the focus of philosophical thought should be to deal with the conditions of existence of the individual person and his or her emotions, actions, responsibilities, and thoughts. The early 19th century philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, posthumously regarded as ‘the father of existentialism’, maintained that the individual solely has the responsibilities of giving one's own life meaning and living that life passionately and sincerely, in spite of many existential obstacles and distractions including despair, angst, absurdity, alienation, and boredom. Over the last century, experts have written on many commonalities between Buddhism and various branches of modern western psychology like phenomenological psychology, psychoanalytical psychotherapy, humanistic psychology, cognitive psychology and existential psychology. In comparison to other branches of psychology, less have been studied and talked on the commonalities between Buddhist philosophy and modern existential psychology that have been propagated in the west. Buddha said that the life is ‘suffering’. Existential psychology speaks of ontological anxiety (dread, angst). Buddha said that ‘suffering is due to attachment’. Existential psychology also has some similar concepts. We cling to things in the hopes that they will provide us with a certain benefit. Buddha said that ‘suffering can be extinguished’. The Buddhist concept of nirvana is quite similar to the existentialists' freedom. Freedom has, in fact, been used in Buddhism in the context of freedom from rebirth or freedom from the effects of karma. For the existentialist, freedom is a fact of our being, one which we often ignore. Finally, Buddha says that ‘there is a way to extinguish suffering’. For the existential psychologist, the therapist must take an assertive role in helping the client become aware of the reality of his or her suffering and its roots. As a practising psychiatrist, clinician, therapist we often face patients with symptoms of depression where aetiology is not merely a reactive one, not an interpersonal conflict, not simply a cognitive distortion! Patients mainly present with some form of personal ‘existential crisis’. Unless we understand and address these existential questions, we probably, will fail to alleviate the symptoms of depression, by merely prescribing drugs, in these patients!

10.30727/0235-1188-2018-11-86-102,Universality and Autonomy in Kant’s Moral Philosophy,"The paper is devoted to the analysis of Kant’s approach to the ideas of universality and autonomy as the constitutive features of morality. The paper shows that Kant’s findings concerning these ideas were anticipated by the previous history of moral philosophy, mainly by the modern moral philosophers, who focused specifically on the elaboration of the philosophical concept of morality. Kant’s peculiar role was that, firstly, he conceptualized the ideas of universality and autonomy and formulated corresponding principles; secondly, Kant integrated both principles into the concept of moral law (a key concept in his moral philosophy) and revealed the way by which the formula of universality and the formula of autonomy together with formula of humanity constitute the supreme principle of morality and essentially express the sense of morality itself. Kant believed that the reason for the failure of the previous attempts to explicate the supreme principle of morality was inability to understand that the moral agent is subject not only to universal but at the same time his own legislation. Thirdly, Kant, unlike his predecessors, in his examination of universality didn’t appeal to the human nature or nature of things. Fourthly, he underlined that the principle of universality and the principle of autonomy were not only interconnected but also shaped each other: the determination of will may be identified as a universal principle only if it is given through a moral agent’s rational will. And a moral agent may be identified as autonomous only if in his decisions and actions he is guided by principles that are universalizable."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-10-130-142,On the Return to Metaphysics in Analytical Philosophy of Mind,"The article examines the change of theoretical framework in analytic philosophy of mind. It is well known fact that nowadays philosophical problems of mind are frequently seen as incredibly difficult. It is noteworthy that the first programs of analytical philosophy of mind (that is, logical positivism and philosophy of ordinary language) were skeptical about difficulty of that realm of problems. One of the most notable features of both those programs was the strong antimetaphysical stance, those programs considered philosophy of mind unproblematic in its nature. However, the consequent evolution of philosophy of mind shows evaporating of that stance and gradual recovery of the more sympathetic view toward the mind problematic. Thus, there were two main frameworks in analytical philosophy of mind: 1) the framework of logical positivism and ordinary language philosophy dominated in the 1930s and the 1940s; 2) the framework that dominated since the 1950s and was featured by the critique of the first framework. Thus, the history of analytical philosophy of mind moves between two highly opposite understandings of the mind problematic. The article aims to found the causes of that move in the ideas of C. Hempel and G. Ryle, who were the most notable philosophers of mind in the 1930s and the 1940s."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-10-47-64,The Discussion on the Principle of Universalizability in Moral Philosophy of the 1950s and 1960s: An Analysis,"The article offers a review and analysis of the discussion on the principle of universalizability at its initial stage (1950s and 1960s). The author determines the theoretical roots and key points of the discussion and reveals the directions of controversy and the position of researchers. In particular, the problem field depends on the divergence of the ethical and logical aspects of the principle of universalizability. As a result, two areas of discussion are formed: 1) the search for an ethical interpretation of the principle of universalizability, 2) an analysis of the principle of universalizability in its relation to the ethical idea of the action. The author proposes the semantic models (versions) of the principle of universalizability designed to turn it into a substantive moral principle (within the framework of the first direction). These models are based on ideas: a) impartiality, b) justice, c) equality. The models of harmonization of universal normativity and moral experience, law and action are designed to protect the idea of universalizability from accusations of formalism and dogmatism (within the framework of the second direction). The grounds and vulnerabilities of the proposed semantic models of the principle of universalizability are examined (within the framework of the first direction) and the possibility of harmonizing law and action is analyzed (within the framework of the second direction). The understanding of universalizability in analytic philosophy is metaphysical. Within the limits of the metaphysical understanding of universality, the problem of harmonizing the universal law and the idea of individuality cannot be solved. A possible way of solving the problem is an appeal to such a concept of universality in which the idea of universality can be reconciled with the idea of the individual freedom."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-11-114-125,“The Revolution of Relativity” and Self-Consciousness in the History of Philosophy of the 20th Century,"This paper discusses the development of self-consciousness in the history of philosophy of the 20th century compared with the same development in the natural sciences. The author characterizes this stage of philosophical historiography as the “revolution of relativity.” This movement of self-consciousness was apparent in not only the humanities but also the natural sciences at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. Awareness of probability is a fundamental achievement of non-classic physics, which has since reversed its paradigm. In contrast to the Newtonian scheme, quantum theory introduces the category of probability and insists that we can talk about certain physical phenomena only in a probabilistic mode and that the method of observation affects the phenomena observed. Consequently, any “object-subject” and “subject-subject” interaction involves the experience of the researcher, which thereby affects the results. The same model of interpretation lies at the basis of the turn toward self-consciousness in the history of philosophy of the 20th century. The classical history of philosophy is built on idealization and gives an objective description of the philosophical process. Following the other sciences, the philosophy of the 20th century understood that historical and philosophical reality largely depends on the historians of philosophy; that such reality is constructed by certain means; that there is a certain kind of historical and philosophical work; and that, with different strategies, methods and approaches, we obtain different results that are complementary to each other. The 20th century was a time of competing interpretations rather than gradually progressing historical and philosophical systems. This stimulated the search for own ideal of objectivity. For philosophical historiography, this is the hermeneutic ideal of the structural analysis of text or architectonic reconstruction. The historicalphilosophical revolution of relativity promotes the development of critical historiography and revises the foundations of its classical tradition."
10.30727/0235-1188-2018-10-65-80,The Discussion on the Principle of Universalizability in Moral Philosophy in the 1970s and 1980s: An Analysis,"In this paper, I analyzed the discussion on the principle of universalizability which took place in moral philosophy in 1970–1980s. In short, I see two main problems that attracted more attention than others. The first problem is an opposition of universalizability and generalization. M.G. Singer argued for generalization argument, and R.M. Hare defended universalizability thesis. Hare tried to refute Singer’s position, using methods of ordinary language philosophy, and claimed that in ethics generalization is useless and misleading. I have examined Singer’s defense and concluded that he was right and Hare was mistaken. Consequently, generalization argument is better in clarification of the relationship between universality and morality than Hare’s doctrine of universalizability, and hence the universality of moral principles is not incompatible with the existence of exclusions. The second problem is the substantiation of the application of categorical imperative in the theory of relevant act descriptions and accurate understanding of the difference between maxims and non-maxims. In Generalization in Ethics, Singer drew attention to this theme and philosophers have proposed some suggestions to solve this problem. I describe ideas of H.J. Paton, H. Potter, O. O’Neill and M. Timmons. Paton coined the teleological-law theory. According to Potter, the best criterion for the relevant act descriptions is causal one. O’N eill suggested the inconsistency-of-intention theory. Timmons defended the causal-law theory. My claim is that the teleological-law theory and the causal-law theory fail to solve the relevant act descriptions problem and the causal criterion and the inconsistency-of-intention theory have their limits. From this, I conclude that these approaches cannot be the basis for clarifying the connection between universality and morality, in contrast to Singer’s approach, which, therefore, is better than others to clarify the nature of universality in morality."

This chapter is not presenting a program or curriculum but instead highlights key areas of change. Colleges of education must restructure their approach to current teacher preparation programs in order to instill, model, and foster the type of teaching that we wish to produce in our educators. "

References to these terms, with explanations, will be given later. The reason, why we find Ibn‘Arabi using such a large collection of terms for one thing, is twofold. In the first place, it is due to the fact that he derived his material from so many divergent sources, preserving, so far as possible, the terminology of each source. Here, e.g., he is using terms borrowed from Sufis, scholastic theologians, Neo-platonists, the Qur’an and so on. Secondly, his pantheism enables him to use the name of anything for the One Reality which is the ultimate ground of all things. The terms to below refer to different aspects of the One Reality which is now regarded as the Logos.[Tidak kurang dari sekitar 22 istilah yang digunakan oleh Ibn ‘Arabi untuk merujuk apa yang disebut sebagai “logos Muhammad”. Beberapa referensi bagi istilah tersebut dengan penjelasannya akan dijelaskan berikutnya.  Terdapat dua alasan utama yang menjadikan Ibn ‘Araby menggunakan puluhan istilah untuk menyebut hal yang sama. Pertama, dikarenakan adanya fakta bahwa ia mengambil seluruh material dari berbagai macam sumber dan sebisa mungkin mempertahankan istilah dari masing-masing sumber. Dalam hal ini, ia meminjam istilah dari kelompok sufi, teolog skolastik, neo-platonis, al-Qur ’an dan yang lainnya. Kedua, panteisme-nya memungkinkan untuk memakai beragam nama sesuatu bagi satu realitas yang menjadi pusat dari segala sesuatu. Istilah-istilah yang begitu banyak merupakan aspek-aspek yang berbeda dari Realitas Yang Satu yang kini dipandang sebagai Logos.]"

10.31973/aj.v1i126.66,The truth of the prophecy and miracles in the  religion philosophy,"      In this research, we have attempted to shed light on one of the main topics dealt with by the philosophy of religion, revelation, prophecy and miracles. I will focus on this research on the most important aspects of the study of contemporary Arab writers: Adib Saab, Sawdust. The central question we will ask is: Is revelation possible? Is prophecy translated and miracles? What is the validity of revelation and prophethood miracles? Are miracles only for prophets? Or else? We find that the writer is difficult to prove the issue of revelation through the statement of the quality of the divine discourse directed to humans from the tongue of God, and on the issue of miracles in the opinion of Adib Saab that miracles (wonders) is only the natural law itself. Al-Khasht agrees with the view that revelation and prophecy can be obtained. There is no logical impossibility in addressing God to His creatures, and if the quality of the speech directed by God differed to His creatures, either in the matter of miracles he goes on to say that miracles are not a creation of natural law, Which is familiar with nature, and while we find Nashar goes to support the issue of revelation, but warns of the need to distinguish between revelation in monotheistic religions and visions of the ruling. As for the issue of miracles, the narration is either a reason to prove the prophecy of a prophet or to prove a wisdom. Miracles are nothing but God's act in nature, and if we do not understand it now we may understand it tomorrow"
10.26417/ejis.v4i3.p32-38,"Arts, Virtue and Character: Perspectives from Philosophy and Psychology",": In today’s world, the tendency to live constantly connected to a virtual digital space makes it difficult to have an ambiance that fosters paused reflections. Often times, one needs to make a conscious effort to stop and think if one recognises the importance of reflections for making the deliberated choices needed for self-development. For many people, a break from the frenzy of activities is facilitated by arts, such as narratives and music. Interestingly, more than just means of entertainment, the arts can be important catalysts for learning processes. Ancient philosophers affirmed that music is helpful in education to virtue as it tempers the emotions of a child to raise it towards the good. However, such high regards for art and music in character formation is often forgotten today.From the perspective of contemporary narrative philosophy, each action or choice which builds up into the habit is best understood as part of a continuous narrative. One understands the self better when considering it as the protagonist of a narrative moving from a beginning towards an end, guided by chosen goals which are good for the acting subject. Additionally contemporary psychologists acknowledge the role of the arts in character formation. This conceptual paper brings together ideas from psychology and philosophy in order to explore the role of some forms of art in character development. The appreciation of the on-going construction of the plot of one’s life-story guided by the intrinsic goods that promote human flourishing (including aesthetic experiences), may serve as a foundation for understanding the importance of coherence and unity of life for building character."
10.32420/1999.11.1015,To the concept and problem sphere of the philosophy of religion,"The widespread influence of religion, the absolute distribution and functioning of it at all stages of human history naturally generated and raises questions about the nature of this spiritual phenomenon, the transient force of its influence on the world of the inner human needs, as well as the spiritual culture of mankind as a whole."
10.28937/1000108078,Outlines for a Phenomenology of Freedom,"The article deals with the question of phenomenological ethics, comparing Husserl’s and Fink’s ways of understanding the phenomenological reduction and thereby the pedagogical tasks of phenomenology, whose existential meaning lies in the “doctrine of freedom” (“Lehre von der Freiheit”), which is in turn closely linked with the problem of the beginning of philosophizing, since the phenomenological reduction presupposes itself. A comparison between Fink’s and Patocka’s views of freedom as transcendence (expressed by the concepts of hermitry and sacrifice), as well as a phenomenological reading of Nietzsche’s transvaluation of values in relation to the educational theme of the Idealbildung, will let us see how Fink’s cosmological philosophy, having its hermeneutic keystone in the phenomenon of play, still has phenomenological features and pedagogical implications, being describable as a phenomenology of freedom, whose idea of freedom as “experiment” or as man’s “self-production” presents interesting analogies with Arendt’s view of action."
10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.572,A Fanonian Philosophy of Race,"Frantz Fanon was one of the most important voices in decolonial and black liberation struggles of the mid-20th century. Writing about race and colonialism in Martinique, France, and Algeria, he articulated the importance of blackness to Western frameworks of the human. The black studies scholarship influenced by Fanon has continued in a similar vein, arguing that much of modern, Western thought either does not discuss race at all or considers race as an add-on to the larger discussion of Western subjectivity. Alternatively, Fanon and his interlocutors argue that race is the central function of the larger fields of Western philosophy and science, even if race is not mentioned at all. To make this claim, they largely point toward two tendencies in Western thought. First, Fanon and his interlocutors often examine the centrality of time and space in modern Western philosophy. Indeed, much of Western philosophy and science has implicitly and explicitly examined time as a linear trajectory that is largely monopolized by the Western European and North American white male subject; alternatively, space has been theorized as the static and nondynamic measure of the Western subject’s capacity to progress. Second, Fanon and his interlocutors also critically interrogate the related discussion of mutual recognition that is assumed in much of Western thought. As such, Western thinkers have often contended that, historically, the self recognizes itself in the other, and vice versa, and that self/other relationship is the basis for concepts of subjectivity. Yet, Fanon and his interlocutors have also pointed out that the lack of recognition of black people as human or as subjects has done little to foreclose whiteness as the position overrepresented as the human. Rather than recognition, white people have historically enacted racial violence against black bodies as a central mode through which to enter into humanity. As such, time and space and the lack of recognition as outlined by Fanon and his interlocutors suggest that nonwhite bodies have always provided a crisis for Western concepts of universality and subjecthood."

Almost all aspects of human life are always wrapped in some form of art. Indonesia is a country that has diverse artistic expressions. Different from Western arts that emphasize the element of aesthetics, traditional arts in various cultures in the Eastern world display elements that are more than just aesthetics. Other intended elements include the values or the life philosophy of the owner community. Traditional music always has two components that can not be separated from one another: textual and contextual aspects. Understanding a musical tradition should cover both aspects in their entirety. This paper aims to expose the contextual aspects of a musical tradition of Ngadha, Flores, NTT called go laba. The contextual aspect in question is the values or life philosophy of the community represented through this traditional music."
10.14483/udistrital.jour.rc.2016.24.a1,History and Philosophy of Science as a Guide to Understanding Nature of Science,"Nature of science (NOS) is considered to be a controversial topic by historians, philosophers of science and science educators. It is paradoxical that we all teach science and still have difficulties in understanding what science is and how it develops and progresses. A major obstacle in understanding NOS is that science is primarily ‘unnatural’, that is it cannot be learned by a simple observation of phenomena. In most parts of the world history and philosophy of science are ‘inside’ science content and as such can guide our understanding of NOS. However, some science educators consider the ‘historical turn’ as dated and hence neglect the historical approach and instead emphasize the model based naturalist view of science. The objective of this presentation is to show that the historical approach is very much a part of teaching science and actually complements naturalism. Understanding NOS generally requires two aspects of science: Domain general and domain specific. In the classroom this can be illustrated by discussing the atomic models developed in the early 20th century which constitute the domain specific aspect of NOS. This can then lead to an understanding of the tentative nature of science that is a domain general aspect of NOS. A review of the literature in science education reveals three views (among others) of understanding NOS: a) Consensus view: It attempts to include only those domain-general NOS aspects that are the least controversial (Lederman, Abd-El-Khalick); b) Family resemblance view: Based on the ideas of Wittgenstein, this view promotes science as a cognitive system (Irzik, Nola); c) Integrated view: this view postulates that both domain general and domain specific aspects of NOS are not dichotomous but rather need to be integrated and are essential if we want students to understand ‘science in the making’ (Niaz). The following framework helps to facilitate integration: i) Elaboration of a theoretical framework based on presuppositions, guiding assumptions,  and previous experience of the scientist; ii) Formulation of research questions; iii) Operationalizing heuristic principles; iv) Designing experiments; and v) Understanding NOS. Various examples from history of science are provided to show how understanding ‘science in the making’ is important in order to integrate domain general and domain specific aspects of NOS. It is concluded that the integrated view of NOS facilitates ‘science in the making’ as based on the postulation of alternative interpretations of experimental data, which are controversial and thus science is primarily a human enterprise.Historia y Filosofía de la Ciencia como una guía para entender la naturaleza de la CienciaLa naturaleza de la ciencia (NOS) se considera que es un tema controvertido por los historiadores, los filósofos de educadores de la ciencia y de la ciencia. Es paradójico que todos enseñar ciencia y todavía tienen dificultades para comprender lo que es la ciencia y cómo se desarrolla y progresa. Un obstáculo importante en la comprensión de la NOS es que la ciencia es sobre todo ""antinatural"", es decir que no se puede aprender mediante una simple observación de los fenómenos. En la mayor parte de la historia del mundo y la filosofía de la ciencia son contenido de la ciencia ""dentro"" y como tal puede guiar nuestra comprensión de la NOS. Sin embargo, algunos profesores de disciplinas científicas consideran el ""giro histórico"" como anticuada y, por tanto, el abandono del enfoque histórico y en su lugar hacen hincapié en el modelo basado en la visión naturalista de la ciencia. El objetivo de esta presentación es mostrar que el enfoque histórico es una parte muy importante de la enseñanza de la ciencia y de hecho complementa el naturalismo. La comprensión de la NOS requiere generalmente dos aspectos de la ciencia: dominio general y dominio específico. En el aula esto puede ser ilustrado por la discusión de los modelos atómicos desarrollados en el siglo 20 que constituyen el aspecto específico de dominio de la NOS. Esto puede conducir a una comprensión de la naturaleza provisional de la ciencia que es un aspecto general de dominio de la NOS. Una revisión de la literatura en la educación científica revela tres puntos de vista (entre otros) de entendimiento NOS: a) Vista Consenso: Se intenta incluir sólo aquellos aspectos NOS dominio general que son los menos controvertido (Lederman, Abd-El-Khalick); b) Vista aire de familia: Sobre la base de las ideas de Wittgenstein, este punto de vista promueve la ciencia como un sistema cognitivo (Irzik, Nola); c) Visión integrada: este punto de vista postula que tanto el dominio de dominio general y aspectos específicos de la NOS no son dicotómicas, sino más bien deben ser integrados y son esenciales si queremos que los estudiantes entienden 'la ciencia en la toma' (Niaz). El siguiente marco ayuda a facilitar la integración: i) Elaboración de un marco teórico basado en presuposiciones, los supuestos de guía, y la experiencia previa del científico; ii) La formulación de preguntas de investigación; iii) Operacionalización de principios heurísticos; iv) El diseño de experimentos; y v) la comprensión de NOS. Varios ejemplos de la historia de la ciencia se proporcionan para mostrar cómo la comprensión 'la ciencia en la toma' es importante con el fin de integrar dominio generales y de dominio de aspectos específicos de la NOS. Se concluye que la visión integrada de la NOS facilita 'la ciencia en la toma ""como basado en la postulación de interpretaciones alternativas de los datos experimentales, que son controvertidos y por lo tanto la ciencia es ante todo una empresa humana.História e Filosofia da Ciência como um guia para a compreensão da natureza da CiênciaNatureza da ciência (NOS) é considerado como sendo um tema controverso por historiadores, filósofos de educadores de ciências e ciências.

10.14746/sr.2018.2.2.05,THE IDEA AND PRACTICALITIES OF ‘NATURE’ IN JANUSZ KORCZAK’S PHILOSOPHY,"This article tackles that question of the place of Nature as an idea and Life in Nature as a reality in the education philosophy of Janusz Korczak. First, we establish the idea that Korczak was a naturalistic philosopher and that nature in its broad cosmic sense serves as the ordering principle of his entire pedagogical legacy. Influenced by Stoic philosophy, Korczak rejects transcendence and sees the human being in the only context possible, nature.Following this paradigm, we establish Korczak's education as a reality guided pedagogy. The nature of the child mandates education and not free unrealistic aspirations. The nature of the child, his family, his biography in its broadest sense also set the limits of what can be achieved through education.At last, we follow Korczak's appreciation of nature and countryside experience as a healing experience for poverty inner city children. There, in nature, in free play, work and sport, they regain their physical and mental health. There Korczak also had his best opportunity to learn the child and to develop his known educational ideas, which he later on implemented in his children houses."

The Love of the Art to the Philosophy: Investigation of the Thought on the Love,"La relazionalità è l’indiscutibile certezza intorno alla quale possono convergere diverse visioni antropologiche. La relazione d’amore tra uomo e donna è il nucleo dell’antropologia ed è al tempo stesso il punto di crisi della cultura attuale. In realtà, non possiamo pensare che l’amore sia una cosa dall’orizzonte limitato: una cosa che si può misurare con parametri finiti come il tempo e lo spazio. L’amore umano —per la sua somiglianza con quello divino— sarà in qualche modo anch’esso infinito e dotato di una fecondità “creatrice” nel senso che provoca una crescita nell’essere. E’ tempo di concentrare il pensiero su questa esperienza per restituirla alla vita con una consapevolezza più totale, razionale oltre che emotiva.The love relationship between man and woman is at the core of Anthropology and it is also a starting point for today’s cultural crisis. Love is not a reality with limited horizons that can be measured with finite parameters such as space and time. Because of its similitude with the divine, human love is also, to some extent, infinite and it possess a “creating” fecundity inasmuch as it causes a growth in the being. It is time to concentrate our thoughts into this experience with the purpose of returning it to life with a more complete consciousness, one derived from reason, not just feeling."

10.24310/metyper.2011.v0i5.2793,La drammatica di “natura” e “persona” nella filosofia dell’uomo di Karol Wojtyła. The “Nature-Person” Drama in Karol Wojtyła’s Philosophy of Man,"Il nucleo teoretico della filosofia dell’uomo di Karol Wojtyła può essere reperito nel nesso intrinseco “natura-persona”, profondamente radicato nel cuore della teologia cristiana (e della meditazione cristologica): l’uomo-persona possiede la sua natura, ma è irriducibile ad essa; egli pertanto può integrare la sua natura, “personalizzandola” attraverso l’operatività cosciente. In questa prospettiva tra persona e natura si innesca una tensione drammatica peculiare, il cui campo specifico è costituito dall’esperienza dell’uomo e dal suo atto. L’esperienza, inscritta nella dinamica dell’incontro con la persona e le persone, rivela inoltre il dialogo interiore tra l’autoconoscenza e l’autocoscienza. La soggettività metafisica viene indagata alla luce di un’ontologia ipostatica e comunionale: l’uomo in quanto persona è originariamente inscritto nella communio personarum e vede la propria umanità compiuta integralmente nella trasformazione in Cristo, lungo il cammino della metanoia e della divinizzazione (Theosis).The theoretical kernel of Karol Wojtyła’s philosophy of man is represented by the intrinsic nexus “nature-person”, deep-rooted in the hearth of Christian theology (and Christological meditation): the human person possesses its nature, but it is irreducible to its nature; therefore person can integrate nature, “personalizing” it through conscious operativity. Accordingly, a peculiar dramatic tension springs up between person and its nature: human experience and human act constitute the specific field of this drama. Experience, inscribed into the dynamic of meeting another person, also reveals the inner dialogue between self-knowledge and self-consciousness. The metaphysical subjectivity is investigated in the light of a hypostatic and communional ontology: the human person is originally inscribed into communio personarum and it is destined to the transformation in Christ, i.e. metanoia and divinisation of man (Theosis)."

Filosofía Leibniziana y el Pluralismo de la religión y la cultura: el caso de China,"In this paper, I present Leibniz’s understanding of natural theology and reason for which, according to him, any person in the world has her natural reason, through which she can realize eternal truths such as that every human soul is immortal. Secondly I discuss how Leibniz evaluated the Chinese theology. According to him, the ancient Chinese understood God or the supreme substance by the name of “Li (理)” or Shangdi (上帝), and without a revelation they knew that God created everything in the universe in accordance with His providence. Then I argue that although Leibniz’s understanding of the Chinese theology was not altogether accurate, we can still understand that in a limited sense, Leib- niz had a pluralistic view in terms of religion and culture that can foster dialogue today between the philosophies of the world. "

Como consecuencia, también el pensamiento que trate de comprenderlo progresará y se modificará. El criterio para este cambio son los distintos tipos de ente y el grado de cognoscibilidad que cada uno permite y reclama.The author briefly reviews the various authors who have questioned the unity of Aristotle’s first philosophy. Then, she defends that unity, organising it according to the senses of being. Aristotle wanted to know reality as it is. But reality is always dynamic. As a consequence, the thinking which tries to understand reality will also make progress and change. The criteria for this change are the various types of being and the degree of cognoscibility [the degree to which we may know] which each one allows and requires."

Person as Inner Horizon in the Philosophy of Manuel Mindán,"Las personas somos absolutamente diferentes de las cosas, no cabe ninguna duda al respecto. No obstante, sí debemos diferenciar nítidamente entre los individuos y el concepto de “persona”. Así pues, la persona posee un “horizonte interior”, absolutamente novedoso y que le caracteriza como ser en aproximación a la Verdad y a la Libertad, las cuales no sólo son específicas del propio humano, sino que le son necesarias en cuanto remedios contra la desolación y la tiranía. Asimismo, una sociedad puede ser tiránica en varios sentidos, pero Manuel Mindán sostiene que, para que no lo sea, el individuo entendido como “persona” debe primar siempre sobre el grupo gregario y cerrado.People and things are quite different, but we must distinguish clearly between individuals and the concept of “person”. So, the person possesses an “inner horizon”, completely new, and characterizes him as being on approach to Truth and Freedom -which are specific to the human itself-, while both are needed as remedies against desolation and tyranny. Likewise, a society can be tyrannical, in several senses. However, Manuel Mindán believes that the individual understood as a “person” must always prevail over the gregarious and closed group."

Fundamental Elements of Leonardo Polo’s Philosophy,"El propósito de este artículo es mostrar una interpretación de la filosofía de Polo. A mi juicio esta filosofía tiene dos aspectos irreductibles; por un lado, el aspecto de novedad y por otro lado, el aspecto que continúa varias tradiciones en diferentes direcciones. Cuando uno tiene en cuenta estos dos aspectos puede evitar una interpretación ingenua de la losofía poliana. La propuesta consiste en leer a Polo como un pensador con diferentes facetas: 1) Polo como pensador original e histórico, 2) como pensador del límite y de su abandono metódico, 3) como pensador cristiano, 4) pensador de la distinctio realis, 5) pensador transcendental, 6) filósofo de la Creación y la Revelación, y por último, 7) como pensador del pensar. The aim of this paper is to present a possible interpretation of Polo’s philosophy. This philosophy have two correlative aspects; first, the aspect of novelty, and second, the aspect of continuity in a different traditions (Thomistic, Aristotelian, Phenomenological) and in a diversity of ways. If one has these two aspects in mind thus can be aware of made a naïve interpretation of Polo’s philosophy. The proposal is read Polo as a philosopher with a multiple faces: 1) Original and historical philosopher, 2) philosopher of the limit of the knowledge and the methodical abandonment of this limit, 3) Christian philosopher, 4), philosopher of the distinction realis 5) transcendental thinker, 6) thinker of the Creation and Revelation, and 7) Polo as thinker of thought. "

Metaphysical Argumentation in Aristotle’s Philosophy,"A las ciencias que abstraen per modum formae o partis, les corresponden frecuentemente las demostraciones por causa formal. En cambio, a las ciencias que abstraen per modum totius, esto es, las que no consideran solo la forma, sino la substancia entera o la esencia con su esse, desencadenan demostraciones que tienen su eje en la causa eficiente. Las demostraciones por vía de causa eficiente deben atenerse a la existencia de los efectos (son demostraciones existenciales), mientras que las demostraciones por vía de causa formal recurren solo a la definición (son demostraciones esenciales). En este trabajo mostramos que Aristóteles y Tomás de Aquino prefieren, en su discurrir metafísico, las demostraciones existenciales, por encima de las demostraciones esenciales.Sciences that abstract per modum formae o partis frequently resort to demonstration by formal causes. On the other hand, sciences that abstract per modum totius, that is, those that do not consider just the form but also the whole substance or essence including its esse, produce demonstrations based on efficient causes. These latter kinds of demonstrations abide by the existence of the effects (they are existential demonstrations), while demonstrations by formal causes resort just to definitions (they are essential demonstrations). This paper shows that Aristotle and Aquinas prefer existential demonstrations to essential demonstrations in their metaphysical reflections."

Modern dissentism, however, is a response to Soviet rule different from what we call opposition in the West. In the Baltic republics it must be dated from 1968, the watershed year in the rise of human rights movement in the Soviet Union. In Estonia and Latvia, dissident activity was galvanized to life primarily by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia which provoked vocal criticism. In Lithuania, reaction to Czechoslovakia's occupation coincided with the growing concern that an increasingly severe implementation of prohibitive anti-religious legislation will choke off the existence of the Catholic church. Concern for religious rights served as the primary catalyst for the reborn dissent movement in Lithuania."

                  Frog Pond Philosophy explores ways of thinking “humans” and “nature” together so as to provide a philosophical and ethical alternative to the separation of human being and the rest of natural being that has been created by dominant currents in modern philosophy and modern science. The book offers two types of reflection that are meant to supplement and complement one another: personal essays and reflections based on direct encounters with nonhuman species and landscapes; and interpretive, philosophical essays devoted to a range of important modern and contemporary thinkers—from Descartes and Spinoza to Alfred North Whitehead and Hans Jonas, from Darwin to Aldo Leopold and Ernst Mayr. These essays offer a history of modern philosophies of nature and suggests a new direction for contemporary thought. Frog Pond Philosophy gives a distinctive voice to a natural world consisting of humans and all other species, each part of a vital whole, where humans have a special responsibility to conserve, respect, and nurture that complex living whole in all its richness and diversity."

The mechanist universe is a play of forces that communicate no meaning or “sound.” The frog pond is orchestra-like—is alive, communicative, and filled with significance to be interpreted and heard. But human beings are not in tune with this reality. Careless human activities are threatening the integrity, perhaps the very continuation, of its complex music."

Once the philosophy was crafted, I observed that all other human beings seem to go through the same process. The philosophy did not originate as a formal study.&amp;nbsp; However, in this article I did a systematic study on the concepts to verify the initial propositions.&amp;nbsp; In order to achieve my goal a formal study was done using a descriptive approach to explicate the modus operandi of the philosophy with a view of understanding its nature and the role each of the essential elements plays.&amp;nbsp; A conceptual analysis method was used focusing on the definition of key concepts. It was conclusively found that each concept played a significant role in driving human behaviour in every situation. The findings&amp;rsquo; implications are very significant to trainers, coaches, educators and all whose goal is to affect human beings towards particular exit outcomes.&amp;nbsp; The findings made it very simple also for me to deductively conclude that the philosophy is a system and is valid."

In this chapter, the author surveys some of the topics discussed by the so-called new mechanists. These include the nature of mechanisms themselves, how mechanisms are discovered and represented via models, the debate over the norms of mechanistic explanation, and the relationship between mechanisms and causation."

10.3329/iiucs.v9i0.24015,Philosophy of Education in view of the pressing Muslim Requirement in the Islamic and World Perspective,"In Islam education is endemic to humanity and to the Muslims talabul ilm, acquisition cum research, is imperative, whereas by being bounded within the four walls of husulul ilm, acquisition of knowledge, education of the present-day Muslims has became epidemic by dint of their enthusiasm especially for chewing the cud of the foreign nations in the name of modernization of education which practically throws the Muslim elites out of the global Ummatic social arena turning them into supplanted personalities. Hence, in order to catching up with the dynamic spirit of Islamic education the Muslims are required to suitably overhaul the mentality and aims and objects of education.IIUC Studies Vol.9 December 2012: 79-106"
10.3329/iiucs.v9i0.24014,Islamic Philosophy of Education and Our Challenges Ahead,"Philosophical foundation of any area of study or disciple is very important aspect to deal with before undertaking comprehensible plans and programs to implement. Education is a quite undefined and ever expanding area of human resource development directly related to the nation-building, national security, and overall emancipation of the masses. Creaking highly professional and skilled human resources is indeed one of the prime goals for any education system. However, at the ground levels, our failure to disseminate minimum knowledge based on objective assimilation of required information may endanger the survival of the entire nation. Feeding the nation with only greed for money, wealth, and power may cause tremendous damage to the psyche of a nation leading to disastrous consequences for educational policies as well. Finding right kind of balance for educational and cultural system is a very big challenge. This complicated challenge with many ideological, social, and economic dichotomies can only be met by reforming education at its core. Any Morally sound and economically viable system of education needs technical support all the way from top to bottom. Simple mechanical and rote learning of anything may be good for some individual drives to be fulfilled immediately. But those drives as a whole may not be befitting to save a nation from ignorance, moral decadence and arrogance. Thus we can hardly overemphasize the importance of building a comprehensive philosophical foundation based on some universal and Islamic values directed to creating humble souls with cutting edge technological know-how beneficial for the entire ummah, human race, and major causes of environmental protection. The major objective of writing this paper is to articulate some of the challenges we have been confronting in our education system as a whole and to endeavor finding a few approaches to address at least some of those problems to help ourselves in making us better equipped to bring happiness, prosperity, and humility around us all, and also to keep trying to leave the planet a better place for the generations to come for their safety, security, and spiritual salvation in worldly life and hereafter.IIUC Studies Vol.9 December 2012: 59-78"
10.1163/15718182-02403001,Promoting Human Rights through Philosophy with Children,"Whilst much has been written about children’s rights and children’s human rights, little appears to have been said about the place children have in the promotion of human rights. This article considers the concept of child in conjunction with citizenship education to take forward children’s promotion of human rights. It is proposed that one approach, where individuals explore views and come to this through reason, dialogue and community engagement, would be through Philosophy with Children (PwC). PwC provides space for children to engage in the political, that they might explore questions relevant to their lives as beings in society. Such activity would not only prepare children for the political world, since this sees the child as deficit, but would facilitate their engagement politically as children. The article proposes that philosophically deliberative children are required in order to support any society interested in the promotion of human rights."
10.3390/rel10010030,The Big and the Great: A Reconstruction of Zhuangzi’s Philosophy on Transcendence,"This essay attempts to demonstrate the logic of Zhuangzi in his different attitudes toward “debate on big and small” by bringing into discussion the two versions of translation in the English languages, which provide a new approach to analyze the difference in the controversial commentaries on Zhuangzi. This essay points out that the ideal of “free and easy wandering” is a type of positive pleasure. By means of rational thinking and imagination, one’s searching for the external values is turned into the internal pursuit for wisdom in the transformation of things. Zhuangzi’s theory of transcendence not only provides the subject with multi-perspectives, but also substitutes the self-identity with self-value. Through the interaction between self-awareness and self-reaction, the subject can be unified with the great Dao through purposive activities. However, Guo Xiang’s commentary cancels the necessity of self-cultivation and negates the purposefulness of the subject, which underestimates the value of Zhuangzi’s construction of transcendence."

Apoline was also developed to improve the mastery of student concepts in the Introduction to Philosophy courses. The type used in this research is development research using a 4-D model consisting of: define, design, develop and disseminate. Data was collected using the questionnaire method and tests. The questionnaires were analyzed using quantitative descriptive techniques whereas, the test were analyzed using t-test statistics. The validity of the design aspects obtained a very good category and the assessment aspects obtained a very good category. Students also responded that Aponline was in the good category. After being applied, it turned out that Apoline is able to improve the discipline, honesty and curiosity of students. Likewise the mastery knowledge of students increases which is proved by t test."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190455934.013.35,Levinas’s Philosophy of Transcendence,"Commentators neglect the transcendence of fecundity in Totality and Infinity in focusing on that of the face. They thereby overlook, first, how substitution in Otherwise Than Being fulfills transcendence as an excendence and, second, how fecundity responds to Hitlerian racism’s reduction of the I to the biological body. Substitution corrects a shortcoming in the face-to-face: how can the face dispossess me if egoism defines my identity? In Levinas’s description of fecundity, the identity of ipseity, where the I is an other on the very basis of a simple identity with itself, is an essential resource for substitution in order to respond to this shortcoming. A worry arises that fecundity revives the tribalism it was meant to combat. A dialectical reading that negotiates the transcendence of fecundity with that of the face shows how the I breaks with biological ties because it cannot slip away from responsibility for others."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190691202.013.10,Latino Philosophy,"Latino philosophy and Latin American philosophy, in spite of their close relation, are taking different paths on foundational questions about their own significance, prospects, and even existence. Furthermore, Latino philosophy must continue to avoid two extreme positions that figure prominently in Latin American philosophy, radical skepticism and overconfident optimism. By resting on exceedingly narrow conceptions of the nature of this type of philosophy, neither of them can help to overcome the challenges facing these fields. But Latino philosophy may have a brighter future, provided it expands the use of reasoned argument beyond the issues discussed in this essay. Some concern the nature of Latino philosophy and its closest relatives. Others involve Latino philosophy’s contribution to solving a recurrent puzzle about which ethnic-group term (if any) is best for talking about US residents who are from the officially Spanish-speaking nations of Latin America by birth or ancestry."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190455934.013.49,The Question of Food and Philosophy in Levinas,"This essay explores the role played by food and hunger in the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. By examining instances in which Levinas mentions food, eating, or hunger, over the course of his career, this essay argues that Levinas was not a “philosopher of food” but, instead, someone for whom food and the body had specific meanings within the tradition of philosophical phenomenology. By engaging with the work of historian of science Steven Shapin, this essay argues Levinas’s work offers an ideal corpus for a reexamination of philosophy’s traditional denigration of the body and its appetites. Furthermore, eating and hunger took on important dual roles in Levinas’s thought, being related both to the creation and maintenance of the self, and to our openness toward the alterity of other persons."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199395699.013.25,James and British Philosophy,"This chapter will explore how James’s pragmatism and British philosophy were intertwined during the first decades of the twentieth century. James’s influence on the Oxford pragmatist F. C.S. Schiller is well known. So is his negative impact on the Cambridge philosophers Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore, who took themselves to be resolutely anti-pragmatist. This “Ten Years War” will be examined in some detail. But what is less known is James’s positive influence on Cambridge philosophy. We shall see that Russell made a pragmatist turn after James’s death, and that move heavily influenced the young and brilliant Frank Ramsey. In turn, Ramsey, the only philosopher Wittgenstein rated highly, influenced Wittgenstein. Those ripples of influence continued well after Ramsey’s death at the age of 26 in 1930."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190455934.013.51,"Levinas, Literature, and Philosophy",This chapter explores posthumously published poems and fragments of novels by Levinas. It shows how seriously Levinas considered abandoning philosophy at a key moment in favor of writing novels. It examines how this calls into question some of Levinas’s positions regarding literature in the postwar period. It looks at how the thematics of his artistic plans conflict with ethical postulations in his major works. It traces relations between these plans and the work of key influential writers like Blanchot. It considers how these novelististic experiments recast Levinas’s essays on aesthetics. And it reflects on how knowledge of this work by Levinas must now inform our appreciation of his philosophical publications.
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190455934.013.13,"Levinas, Philosophy, and Biography","Levinas’s work is notoriously challenging. Indeed, even those who are sympathetic to his ideas and accustomed to his style are not always enthused by Levinas’s often startling prose. Drawing on testimonial Holocaust literature, this essay suggests that Levinas is significantly less confounding when read as a “post-Holocaust” thinker. Situating his ethics in the context of the Holocaust is not to reduce Levinas’s philosophy to biography. Rather, the hope is to show how blurring the line between philosophy and biography can, in specific cases, be worthwhile."

10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190678449.013.25,The Baroque and Philosophy,"Although the concept “baroque” is less obviously applicable to philosophy than to the visual arts and music, early modern philosophy can be shown to have connections with baroque culture. Baroque style and rhetoric are employed or denounced in philosophical controversies, to license or discredit a certain style of philosophizing. Philosophers engage with themes current in baroque literature (the mad world, the world as a stage, the quest for the self) and occasionally transform these into philosophical problems, especially of an epistemological kind (are the senses reliable? how far is our access to reality limited by our perspective?) Finally, the philosophies of Malebranche and Berkeley, with their radical challenges to so-called common sense, and their explanation of conventional understandings of the world as based on illusion, have something of the disturbing quality of baroque art and architecture."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199395699.013.5,Psychology and Philosophy in the Work of William James,"This chapter reviews the relations between psychology and philosophy in the work of William James. Though initially committed to limiting the role of philosophy in his psychological work, James eventually realized that an admixture of philosophy and psychology would not spoil “two good things,” as he had feared, and that it was in any case unavoidable. In fact, many of the basic pillars of his psychology depend upon philosophical distinctions, and many of the premises of his philosophy are drawn from psychological analyses. And while James focused more on psychology in his early years and more on philosophy toward the end of his life, his philosophical interests preceded his study of psychology, and his psychological interests extended throughout his career. An excursus treating James’s views on logic and the nonlogical, toward the end of the chapter, underscores the primacy of experience over analysis in James’s thought, both in psychology and philosophy."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190455934.013.41,Levinas and the Critical Philosophy of Race,"This essay accounts for the efficacy of Levinas’s conceptions of alterity, embodiment, and intersubjectivity for engaging the question of race. It traces the body of scholarship that explicitly deploys Levinas’s work toward this end, as well as existing scholarship on the question of race that might be made more radical by utilizing Levinas in this way. Ultimately, I position Levinas’s rethinking of identity, intersubjectivity, and embodiment as critical tools with which to think about the political experiences of the racialized body, and about the formation of political solidarities around racialized experience. I understand such questions to be, most fundamentally, questions about the meaning of alterity in the space of politics. To that end, the question of race has much to gain from Levinas, insofar as Levinas’s philosophy is, if anything at all, a philosophy of alterity."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199395699.013.8,Pluralism and Toleration in James’s Social Philosophy,"William James wrote almost nothing that would count today as political philosophy. However, it is clear that much of his work is animated by rather profound concerns with our social lives. In this sense, it may be said that James is a social philosopher. The core of Jamesian social philosophy is the doctrine of value pluralism, which animates all of his moral writings. In these essays, James repeatedly attempts to establish that this pluralism underwrites a policy of social toleration. James’s idea is that the irreducible plurality of goods entails that we each must strive for conditions under which as many goods as possible can flourish. This chapter evaluates James’s pluralist argument for social toleration. Ultimately, the chapter argues that James’s value pluralism does not provide a stable basis for social toleration. But the chapter also argues that James has at his disposal a far more promising epistemic argument for social toleration that he left largely undeveloped."
10.1111/j.1747-4469.2010.01219.x,From Public Sociology to Public Philosophy: Lessons for Law and Society,"The late Philip Selznick's final book, A Humanist Science, examines the role of values and ideals in the social sciences, including the study of law and society. Throughout his academic career, Selznick was committed to what he called “legal naturalism,” a sociological version of the natural‐law perspective, while his critics continue to adhere to various forms of positivism. But the age‐old opposition between natural law and legal positivism today may be giving way to the quest for public sociology—a sociology that promotes public reflection on significant social issues and thus functions as a moral and political force. A Humanist Science ends with a strong plea for public philosophy. Public philosophy overlaps with public sociology but is a much stronger concept. Selznick's message of public philosophy may be another of his enduring contributions to the field of law and society."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190455934.013.21,Levinas and Analytic Philosophy,"Recent analytic philosophy often explains responsibility to other persons in terms of normative reasons. Emmanuel Levinas thinks this is backward. We are not responsible because we have reasons to be. It is only because we are responsible to one another that we are able to have reasons. Reasons-first explanations thus marginalize the very relationship our reasonings exact or express, offering a picture of reasoning, reasons, and reason itself that is abstract, impersonal, de-faced. This essay motivates the “re-facing” of reasons and reconstructs Levinas’s explanatory reorientation of reasons and responsibility. The result is an “ethical metaphysics” of reasons that responds well to familiar analytic problems. The conclusion is that reasons do not, like objects, exist and then happen to be something for which we are responsible. Rather, reasons exist like assurances or promises—as exchangeable expressions of ongoing relations of responsibility."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190622879.013.5,Philosophy and the Apparatus of Disability,"Mainstream philosophers take for granted that disability is a prediscursive, transcultural, and transhistorical disadvantage, an objective human defect or characteristic that ought to be prevented, corrected, eliminated, or cured. That these assumptions are contestable, that it might be the case that disability is a historically and culturally specific, contingent social phenomenon, a complex apparatus of power, rather than a natural attribute or property that certain people possess, is not considered, let alone seriously entertained. This chapter draws on the insights of Michel Foucault to advance a historicist and relativist conception of disability as an apparatus (dispositif) of power and identify mechanisms of power within philosophy that produce the underrepresentation of disabled philosophers in the profession and the marginalization of philosophy of disability in the discipline."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199734146.013.68,Epicurus and His Circle,"The chapter gives an account Epicurus’ natural philosophy and his attitude to the sciences. Epicurus’ mission was to liberate people from the fear of death and the gods, and science was subordinate to that project, practiced to show that nature acts without divine intervention. He was skeptical about mathematics, due to his commitment to atomism, and about astronomy, because knowledge should be based on clear foundations unavailable for deciding issues such as the planets’ sizes. Sensation dictates there are two constituents of reality: bodies, directly attested by sense perception; and the void, the space where bodies exist and move. Infinite atoms move through space, forming countless worlds (kosmoi), which at some point will again fall apart into their constituent atoms. Epicurus considers naturalistic explanations of phenomena to show they are not divine. But his philosophy of nature insists upon natural causes (as opposed to geometrical models), is consistently materialist and mechanistic, and is thus anti-teleological."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190455934.013.20,Levinas and Early Modern Philosophy,"The present study claims that Levinas’s engagement with early modern philosophy can be understood as an attempt to appropriate the tradition of modern rationalism by transforming it on the basis of its own internal limits. The article shows this by analysis especially of Levinas’s interpretations of Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant but also of Rousseau, Berkeley, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Pascal. Levinas’s appropriation of early modern rationalism is a transformation from a rationality of ontology and totality to an ethical rationality, anchored in the desire of the infinite and threatened by the rationality of totality. In Levinas’s eyes, it is Immanuel Kant who proves that this particular rationality of a practical infinite does not have its only origin in a religious tradition (that of the Talmud), but it also has another origin in the philosophical tradition of rationalism itself."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190455934.013.7,Theological Terms in the Philosophy of Levinas,"This essay examines Levinas’s use of theological terms in his philosophical texts. References to theology and to theological claims appear throughout his itinerary, yet in his later works terms such as “inspiration”, “witness”, “glory”, and “prophecy” become central. Moreover, their meaning is organized around conceptions of infinity and God that play an important role in his argument for the primacy of the ethical relation with the other person. The latter claim proves to be framed in a philosophy of religion that is irreducible to theology. The status of these matters with Levinas’s major philosophical texts is clarified by recourse to some elements of his unpublished philosophy of language."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199734146.013.75,Stoicism and the Natural World,"The chapter discusses the natural philosophy of the ancient Stoics including the attitude they took towards the so-called special and applied sciences (technai). After a historical outline introducing the main facts and personalities (sec. 1), the role and status of natural philosophy within the Stoic system are explained, with special reference to the moral and theological dimension of the study of nature, that is, the Stoic view of the world as a rationally structured and providentially determined whole and what this view implies for our way of living (sec. 2). Two subsequent sections are concerned with Stoic materialist physics on both the universal (macrocosmic) and the individual (microcosmic) level respectively (sec. 3 and sec. 4). The next section is specifically devoted to exploring Stoic views on, and involvement with, applied sciences and arts such as astronomy, mathematics and medicine (sec. 5). The Epilogue sums up the main results from the preceding discussion (sec. 6)."
10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190248093.013.2,The Philosophy of Assessment in Music Education,"Philosophies of assessment are rare, perhaps even more so in music education. This chapter, arranged in five “movements” intended to reflect various ways of examining assessment issues, considers prominent themes emerging from the music education assessment literature, such as accountability, authentic assessment, consequential validity, legitimacy, mandated testing, metaphor, power-knowledge, and self-determination. The author asks questions such as, To what extent should philosophical commitments be voluntary versus compelled? To what extent should music educators be able to collectively determine educative values and to what extent should others (policymakers, local communities) have a say in what should constitute valuable learning in music? A common theme throughout the chapter is the urge for caution and reflection so that well-intended assessment efforts do not undermine cherished goals for music education."
10.1017/s0265052516000285,WHAT IS A POLITICAL VALUE? POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND FIDELITY TO REALITY,"Abstract:This essay seeks to defend the claim that political philosophy ought to be appropriately guided by the phenomenon of politics that it seeks to both offer a theory of and, especially in its normative guise, offer a theory for. It does this primarily through the question of political values. It begins by arguing that for any value to qualify as a value for the political domain, it must be intelligible in relation to the constitutive features of politics as a human activity. It then examines the extent to which the preconditions for the realization of values in practice ought to figure in our considerations as to whether they are values that fit or belong to our social world. We can understand these parts of the essay as responding to two related questions, respectively: (i) Is this a political value at all? — which is to ask, is it a value that is appropriate for the political realm?; and then (ii) Is this a political value for us? The final section responds to the often-made complaint that political philosophy ought not to make any concessions to the actual world of politics as it really is, arguing that attending to the realities of politics, and in particular the constitutive conditions of political activity, gives meaning to the enterprise as the theorization of politics (and not something else). Furthermore those same conditions provide the limits of intelligibility beyond which ideals and values can no longer be, in any meaningful sense, ideals and values for the political sphere."
10.1017/s0048671x00001612,The History of Mind and the Philosophy of History in Sallust's Bellum Catilinae ,"With the assassination of Julius Caesar on the Ides of March in 44 BCE, the political fortunes of one of Caesar's lesser political partisans began to wane. Gaius Sallustius Crispus, a minor political figure, formerly involved in scandal and now left without a backer, retired from politics and began to write history. His first project was an account of a failed coup d'état from some decades before. Sallust recorded the efforts of a thwarted candidate for Rome's highest office named Lucius Sergius Catilina to raise an army of disaffected Romans and foreigners and to install himself and his partisans at Rome. In the end, though, nothing much came of the plot: some were arrested and killed; some fought and died; others who had not been caught in too manifest support of Catiline were suddenly expressing their enmity for the monster."
10.3390/s18103184,Philosophy and Application of High-Resolution Temperature Sensors for Stratified Waters,"Every application may have its specifically designed sensor. For studying the effects of short-term temperature variations on life in water, a high-resolution sensor has been designed with low noise level &lt;0.1 mK. Pro and cons of the design include its adequacy for use in large heat-capacity environments like water but less in air. The sensor can be used under high static environmental pressure of &gt;1000 Bar (&gt;108 N m−2) in the deepest ocean regions. Its response time of 0.5 s in water allows quantitative studies of internal wave turbulent mixing effects, e.g., on the redistribution of matter and on nearly completely submerged human bodies. In a chain of &gt;100 sensors, clocks are synchronized to sample within 0.02 s and a verified range of 600 m."
10.2307/2859862,"Astrology, Magic, and Optics: Facets of John Dee's Early Natural Philosophy","John Dee (1527-1608) has received increasing scholarly attention since the completion in 1952 of I. R. F. Calder's massive dissertation, ‘John Dee Studied as an English Neoplatonist,’ and with the publication of Peter French's John Dee: The World of an Elizabethan Magus, Dee's career and works should be fairly familiar. Prior to Calder's study, John Dee's press had been none too good, and serious scholars have labored under the burden of demonstrating Dee's place within some important intellectual tradition, so that he might be rescued from the opinion, based upon his penchant for occult studies, that he was ‘… the sport, the laughing-stock and die pray of daemons,’ or, in more modern form, ‘a rather silly man.’"
10.1086/652532,"Albertus, Magnus or Magus? Magic, Natural Philosophy, and Religious Reform in the Late Middle Ages*","AbstractThis article analyzes the fifteenth-century attempt by the Dominican order, especially in Cologne, to win canonization for the thirteenth-century natural philosopher Albert the Great. It shows how Albert's thought on natural philosophy and magic was understood and variously applied, how the Dominicans at Cologne composed his vitae, and how the order's Observant movement participated in these developments. It situates the canonization attempt at the intersection of two significant trends in which the order was a leading participant: first, the late medieval efforts to reform Christian society beginning with the religious life of monks and mendicants; second, the increasing concerns about the practice of learned and demonic magic that laid groundwork for the witch-hunting of the early modern period. The article aims to shed light on intersections of science and religion — their apprehension and negotiation — at a decisive moment in European history for both fields of human endeavor."
10.1086/658508,"The Study of Nature, Philosophy, and the Royal Library of San Lorenzo of the Escorial*","AbstractInterpretations of the iconography of the Royal Library of the Escorial have fostered many assessments of the intellectual panorama of late sixteenth-century Spain. This study advances the thesis that once the Royal Library was established in its permanent premises attempts were made to define its intellectual agenda, and in particular to redirect the study of nature undertaken there in a rather distinct and novel direction. To identify this agenda, this study shuns iconographic interpretation to focus instead on Friar José de Sigüenza's description of the library's frescoes. Once this discourse by the librarian of the Escorial is read independently of meanings that might have been inscribed in the library's iconography and is complemented with insights gleaned from other works by its author and his mentor, Benito Arias Montano, the librarian's description reveals itself to be a manifesto of how the friar thought the study of nature should be undertaken at the Escorial. It entailed a reorientation away from Aristotelian and empiricist approaches and toward the elaboration of a radically new biblist metaphysics."
10.1086/676152,The Use of Kairos in Renaissance Political Philosophy*,"AbstractAlthough the Greek concept of kairos (καιρός) has undergone a recent renewal of interest among scholars of Renaissance rhetoric, this revival has not yet been paralleled by its reception into the history of political thought. This article examines the meanings and uses of this important concept within the ancient Greek tradition, particularly in the works of Isocrates and Plutarch, in order to understand how it is employed by two of the most important political thinkers of the sixteenth century: Thomas Elyot and Niccolò Machiavelli. Through such an investigation this paper argues that an appreciation of the concept of kairos and its use by Renaissance political writers provides a fuller understanding of the political philosophy of the period."
10.2307/2860993,Scholastic Philosophy and Renaissance Magic in the De vita of Marsilio Ficino,"Marsilio Ficino completed the third part of his De vita libri tres,  titled De vita coelitus comparanda,  in July of 1489; by the fall of that year he felt obliged to write an Apologia on behalf of his new book. Though it was destined to be the most popular of his original works, this analysis and defense of astrological magic and medicine caused Ficino worry from the moment of its composition. The Apology shows that he was particularly anxious about the religious orthodoxy of De vita III,  among whose readers he expected to find many ignorant critics and some malignant:"
10.3390/insects10010010,Beekeeping Management Practices Are Associated with Operation Size and Beekeepers’ Philosophy towards in-Hive Chemicals,"Management by beekeepers is of utmost importance for the health and survival of honey bee colonies. Beekeeping management practices vary from low to high intervention regarding the use of chemicals, hive manipulations, and supplemental feeding of colonies. In this study, we use quantitative data from the Bee Informed Partnership’s national survey to investigate drivers of management practices among beekeepers in the United States. This is the first study to quantitatively examine these variables to objectively describe the management practices among different groups of beekeepers in the United States. We hypothesized that management practices and goals among beekeepers are different based on the beekeeper’s philosophy (as determined by their willingness to use chemicals to control pests and pathogens) and the size of the beekeeping operation. Using a multiple factor analysis, we determined that beekeepers use a continuum of management practices. However, we found that beekeepers’ willingness to use in-hive chemicals and the number of colonies in their operation are non-randomly associated with other aspects of beekeeping management practices. Specifically, the size of the beekeeping operation was associated with beekeepers’ choices of in-hive chemicals, while beekeepers’ philosophy was most strongly associated with choices of in-hive chemicals and beekeeping goals. Our results will facilitate the development of decision-making tools for beekeepers to choose management practices that are appropriate for the size of their operations and their beekeeping philosophy."
10.3390/philosophies4010003,The Digital and the Real Universe. Foundations of Natural Philosophy and Computational Physics,"In the age of digitization, the world seems to be reducible to a digital computer. However, mathematically, modern quantum field theories do not only depend on discrete, but also continuous concepts. Ancient debates in natural philosophy on atomism versus the continuum are deeply involved in modern research on digital and computational physics. This example underlines that modern physics, in the tradition of Newton’s Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis, is a further development of natural philosophy with the rigorous methods of mathematics, measuring, and computing. We consider fundamental concepts of natural philosophy with mathematical and computational methods and ask for their ontological and epistemic status. The following article refers to the author’s book, “The Digital and the Real World. Computational Foundations of Mathematics, Science, Technology, and Philosophy.”"
10.1017/s0034412515000244,Seeing the Dao: conceptual metaphors and the philosophy of religion,"AbstractThis article suggests that different philosophical traditions have developed and matured around particular conceptual metaphors. It proposes that conceptual metaphor theory provides a useful tool with which to think about different world philosophical traditions, as it can reveal the deep structure of networks of ideas. Conceptual metaphors are not just linguistic devices; rather they organize whole networks of thought, experience, and activity.

However, Serbian lawyers did not read the original Latin works of Roman jurists, but rather their Greek translations and adaptations from Byzantine legal miscellanies. Some ideas of Stoic philosophy could be found in several chapters of the Serbian translation of the Syntagma, a nomokanonic miscellany put together in 24 titles (each title has a sign of one of the letters of Greek alphabet) by the monk Matheas Blastares from Thessaloniki. The fragments were taken from Roman jurisprudentes Gaius and Florentinus."
10.1515/opphil-2018-0024,How to be a Realist about Similarity: Towards a Theory of Features in Object-Oriented Philosophy,"Abstract
				This essay calls for an independent theory of features in object-oriented philosophy. Theories of features are in general motivated by at least two interconnected demands: 1) to explain why objects have the characteristics they have, 2) to explain how regular divisions in those characteristics can be intuited. While a theory of universal properties may be the most internally consistent means of addressing these demands, an object-oriented metaphysics needs to address them without a concept of shared features. This means that regular divisions of invariant features and our intuitions of them cannot be explained by the repetition of self-same characteristics or natural laws. They can instead be explained by the immanent repetition of similar features. However, this requires a new, radically aesthetic understanding of what it means to be similar in the first place, one in which similarity is an emergent process rather than a state of affairs existing between resembling particulars."

10.5195/jffp.2011.482,Monstrosity and the Limits of the Intellect: Philosophy as Teratomachy in Descartes,"For Descartes, nature must be interpreted through a limited number of simple laws used to describe the multiplicity of the real, focusing on the rule and normality rather than on the exception and monstrosity. Nevertheless, monstrosity has a vital function in Descartes' philosophy. By offering a new reading of the evil genius and the deceiver God in terms of absolute monstrosity, I intend to demonstrate the novel role played by the will in this philosophical ‘teratomachy’. Examining the peculiar status Admiration occupies in the economy of the passions, I also analyze a passage from the Cogitationes circa generatione animalium, the only text in which Descartes explicitly discusses physical monstrosities. I argue that these pages, in which Descartes subscribes to a rigidly mechanistic, epigenetic view of embryology, are in tension with his doctrine of final causes and the idea of continuous creation. My theory is that the entire philosophy of Descartes can be read as a veritable war against a certain idea of monstrosity."

10.5195/jffp.2013.599,Deleuze and Epicurean Philosophy: Atomic Speed and Swerve Speed,"This paper reconstructs Gilles Deleuze’s interpretation of Epicurean atomism, and explicates his claim that it represents a problematic idea, similar to the idea exemplified in early, “barbaric” accounts of the differential calculus. Deleuzian problematic ideas are characterized by a mechanism through whose activity the components of the idea become determinate in relating reciprocally to one another, rather than in being determined exclusively in relation to an extrinsic paradigm or framework. In Epicurean atomism, as Deleuze reads it, such a mechanism of determination can be found in the famous atomic “swerve”. It is necessary to bear this interpretation of Epicurean atomism in mind when understanding Deleuze and Guattari’s promulgation of a new image of thought in What is Philosophy?, which has an explicitly Epicurean inspiration. The paper argues that this inspiration is particularly evident to the extent that Deleuze and Guattari identify the sub-representative feature that lies at the heart of their new image of thought with “chaos”, defined as “infinite speed”. I claim that infinite speed, this otherwise puzzling feature of What is Philosophy?, ought to be understood in the light of Deleuze’s interpretation of Epicurus. Moreover, the Epicurean distinctions between different speeds must be read together with Deleuze’s appropriation of the metaphysics of the ancient Stoics, who, although widely recognized as Deleuze’s Hellenistic counterparts, lack important theoretical resources that the Epicureans provide for Deleuze."

I suggest that contrasting his way of dealing with the intersection of the two discourses to that of two other French thinkers (Jean-Luc Marion and Michel Henry) illuminates his stance more fully. I begin with a brief outline of Ricœur’s claims about the distinction or relation between the discourses, then reflect on those of Marion and Henry, who although they do not relate them in the same way still together form a significant contrast to Ricœur’s perspective, and conclude with a fuller consideration of Ricœur’s methodology in light of this comparison. I suggest that it is in particular his hermeneutic commitments that lead him both to more rigorous distinctions between discourses and ironically to greater mediation."
10.19044/esj.2016.v12n26p199,Hippocrates: Philosophy and Medicine,"It is widely acknowledged that modern ‘scientific medicine’ is in crisis. Roy Porter in his magisterial book, The Greatest Benefit to Mankind, points out that ‘these are strange times, when we are healthier than ever but more anxious about our health. According to all the standards benchmarks, we have never had it so healthy.’ (Porter, 1997). This crisis has many aspects and may be explained by modern Western indifference to a holistic and Classical view of ‘health’ and the ‘body’ in favour of a stimulating and progressive medicine driven more by its ‘scientific’ projects to produce a ‘mechanical’ model of the workings of the body. This paper will look into the historical and conceptual meaning of ‘health’, the ‘body’ and the relationship between philosophy and medicine when they were first dealt with and reflected upon by the ancient father of medicine, namely, Hippocrates. The latter was the first European ‘doctor’ to have aimed at seriously putting medicine within the realm of a ‘scientific’ domain, one which denies its important link to philosophy."

It is the contention of this paper that there is great need for social value reorientation in Nigeria and philosophy should provide the hub for this reengineering of the Nigerian society. The paper argues that there is a big vacuum at the base of Nigeria’s educational system where the students lack any philosophical sense of direction and do not as much as know the philosophy that underlies the societal way of life. The paper employing a critical philosophical appraisal of the current state of affairs argues that philosophy should not only be merely introduced to university students as one of the general courses studied for one semester, it should be studied from the nursery/primary school level through the secondary school to the university level. The content according to this paper should be well articulated as Contemporary Nigerian Philosophy with emphasis on moral leadership training with focus to incorporate future leaders into national values as well as inculcate in them a sense of patriotism which will help address the current ethical, socio-political and economic problems confronting the present day Nigerian society. The paper concluded by advocating the philosophical formulation of a generally acceptable value design to be copied by every segment of the society which will be taught as Contemporary Nigerian Philosophy at all levels of the Nigerian educational program and for all students whether in public or private schools."
10.5195/errs.2012.125,Collective Identity and Collective Memory in the Philosophy of Paul Ricoeur,"Collective memory has been a notoriously difficult concept to define. I appeal to Paul Ricoeur and argue that his account of the relationship of the self and her community can clarify the meaning of collective memory. While memory properly understood belongs, in each case, to individuals, such memory exists and is shaped by a relationship with others. Furthermore, because individuals are constituted over a span of time and through intersubjective associations, the notion of collective memory ought to be understood in terms of the way that memory enacts and reenacts networks of relations among individuals and the communities to which they belong, rather than in terms of a model that reifies either individuals or groups. Ricoeur’s account can show sources of oppression and offers ways to respond to them."

Langer’s Philosophy of Art,"How did the philosophy of Henri Bergson look before Gilles Deleuze’s Bergsonism? This article provides a situated answer to that question by performing a close reading of Susanne K. Langer’s early engagement with Bergson in her monograph Feeling and Form from 1953. Both Bergson and Langer argue against polemical philosophizing. Such polemical modes of doing philosophy distort insight into the thought of the philosophers in question and in philosophical questions per se (such as questions about artistic creation). My reading of Langer’s Bergson is therefore infused with what is nowadays called a new materialist impetus of non-linearity, a non-oppositional philosophizing, and the reading follows the methodology of diffractive reading, a thinking outside fixed and fixating schools of thought. I argue that in spite of Langer’s explicit, i.e., polemical objection to Bergson’s work and to its use by artists, it is a Bergsonism with which Langer’s work is infused."
10.5195/jffp.2016.772,On Bergson's Reformation of Philosophy,"In this essay I focus on the text Creative Evolution (1907) and show that although Bergson intended to make a contribution to the science of biology and to the philosophy of life, the primary aim of the text is to show the need for a fundamental reformation of philosophy. Bergson wants to show how, through an appreciation of the evolution of life, philosophy can expand our perception of the universe. I examine in detail the two essential claims he makes in the text: first, that we have to see the theory of knowledge and the theory of life as deeply related; second, that there is a need to “think beyond the human condition” or human state. Indeed, Bergson conceives philosophy as the discipline that “raises us above the human condition” and makes the effort to “surpass” it. This reveals itself to be something of an extraordinary endeavour since it means bringing the human intellect into rapport with other kinds of consciousness. Moreover, if we do not place our thinking about the nature, character, and limits of knowledge within the context of the evolution of life then we risk uncritically accepting the concepts that have been placed at our disposal. It means we think within pre-existing frames. We need, then, to ask two questions: first, how has the human intellect evolved?, and second, how can we enlarge and go beyond the frames of knowledge available to us?"

The idea, rejected here by Améry, that the enlightenment “must be free of emotion” owes most to its foremost proponent, Immanuel Kant. This paper picks up on this implicit allusion to Kant, and elaborates on Améry’s revision of the enlightenment by making the confrontation between them explicit. "
10.5195/jffp.2018.834,"Deleuze, Concepts, and Ideas about Film as Philosophy: A Critical and Speculative Re-Examination","This article explores the idea of film as a possible means for articulating original philosophical concepts, in Gilles Deleuze’s sense of concepts. The first of two parts, critically re-examines current ideas about film as philosophy in relation to Deleuze’s ideas on philosophy and cinema/art. It is common within the field of film-philosophy to trace back its central argument that film/cinema is capable of expressing original philosophy, to Deleuze’s cinema books. In and around these books, however, Deleuze did not express such an idea and rather underlined sharp formal differences between cinematic thinking and philosophy (however much he also described and implied proximities and similarities). Cinematic thinking takes the form, he argues, of blocks of movement/duration whereas philosophy is defined as the art of creating concepts. Still, could a close critical scrutiny of and some creativity with Deleuze’s thought allow for taking a step he did not take? The second part of the article takes on the speculative question of whether it is possible to create a notion from within Deleuze’s thought as a whole, that allows for at least the theoretical possibility of articulating original philosophical concepts – as Deleuze defines them (as a particular kind of multiplicity) – in and through film, and what this would mean for our understanding of the concrete form of concepts. The article examines Deleuze’s concept of concepts (how he defines their internal logic and by which formal means he implies that they can be articulated), his descriptions of complicating intersections between philosophy and art, some partly conflicting statements on Godard over the years, aspects of his analyses of filmic thinking in Cinema 2 that can be seen to provide preliminary components for articulating concepts in and through film, and it discusses the place and function of words and texts in such filmic articulations. If the aim of the first part is to clarify Deleuze’s positions on film and philosophy (often muddled in current film-philosophical writings) the aim of the second part resonates with the Deleuzian/Nietzschean quest for formal renewal of philosophy. The overall aim is to re-problematize and provide subtle new means for conceiving of and discussing the notion of film as philosophy."
10.1515/pjbr-2018-0004,Masahiro Mori’s Buddhist philosophy of robot,"Abstract
				Masahiro Mori is a well-known Japanese robotics scholar whose notion of Uncanny Valley is worldly famous. Mori is also an initiator of the Robot Contest and a student of Buddhism and a practitioner of Zen. He constructs his original Buddhist philosophy of robotics throughout his career. His robotics work and his learning of Buddhism develop together side by side in an interesting intertwined manner. This paper will take up the issues such as the ethical personality, quality of minds, and experiences of engineers as key components in and for an “ethical design” of robots by examining Mori’s Buddhist philosophy of robotics. This paper is divided into four sections. After an introductory part, in the second section, we will explore Mori’s view of Zen as aspiritual source for technological creativity. In Section 3, we will examine his view into a robot-contest as a location of a realized teaching of Buddhism, especially, in relationship to the Diamond Sūtra, in order to see Mori’s educational contribution. In Section 4, we will examine how Mori became engaged to learn and practice Buddhism and came to the realization of Buddhahood in relation to robotics."
10.2307/631825,Ringing the changes on Gyges: philosophy and the formation of fiction in Plato's Republic,"AbstractGlaucon's story about the ring of invisibility inRepublic359d-60b is examined in order to assess the wider role of fictional fabrication in Plato's philosophical argument. The first part of the article (I) looks at the close connections this tale has to the account of Gyges in Herodotus (1.8-12). It is argued that Plato exhibits a specific dependence on Herodotus, which suggests Glaucon's story might be an original invention: the assumption that there must be a lost ‘original’ to inspire Plato's story of the ring has never accommodated the possibility of Plato drawing, perhaps quite directly, from Herodotus. The next section (II) considers the function of that fable within the larger philosophical and aesthetic structure of theRepublic. Appreciation of the entire dialogue as an exercise in fiction, as well as philosophy, helps to reveal the ways in which philosophical argument and fictional invention are closely bound up in the formation of Glaucon's fabulous anecdote. Finally (III), a reading of Cicero's treatment of the story inDe Officiisconfirms the degree to which philosophical reasoning and fiction can be quite generally interdependent. Although the arguments in Sections II and III are consistent with the opening contention that the ring story was invented by Plato, they do not presuppose it."

10.1093/oso/9780198738831.003.0013,"Dogwhistles, Political Manipulation, and Philosophy of Language","This essay explores the speech act of dogwhistling (sometimes referred to as ‘using coded language’). Dogwhistles may be overt or covert, and within each of these categories may be intentional or unintentional. Dogwhistles are a powerful form of political speech, allowing people to be manipulated in ways they would resist if the manipulation was carried outmore openly—often drawing on racist attitudes that are consciously rejected. If philosophers focus only on content expressed or otherwise consciously conveyed they may miss what is most powerful and pernicious in the speech of political culture. This essay is a call to start paying attention to these more covert speech acts, and a first attempt at beginning to theorize them. It argues that dogwhistles present a complex and interesting case for the philosopher of language, and explores their implications for democratic politics."
10.22329/jtl.v6i1.585,"What would Socrates do? An exploratory study of methods, materials and pedagogies in high school philosophy","For over half a century, North American philosophers and teachers have been interested in introducing philosophy courses at the high school level. In 1995, such a course was introduced into the curriculum for the Canadian province of Ontario, making it the first and only English-speaking jurisdiction in North America to have philosophy as part of its official curriculum, yet to date no investigation of how these courses are taught exists.  Our research addresses this gap in the literature by describing the results of the exploratory stage of our empirical investigation into the practices of Ontario high school philosophy teachers. A survey reveals that they tend to rely heavily on textbooks and employ a wide range of pedagogies in their philosophy classes, favouring discussion and lecture, despite mixed perceptions about their effectiveness."
10.22329/il.v37i4.4794,"Critical Thinking, Bias and Feminist Philosophy: Building a Better Framework through Collaboration","In the late 20th century theorists within the radical feminist tradition such as Haraway (1988) highlighted the impossibility of separating knowledge from knowers, grounding firmly the idea that embodied bias can and does make its way into argument. Along a similar vein, Moulton (1983) exposed a gendered theme within critical thinking that casts the feminine as toxic ‘unreason’ and the ideal knower as distinctly masculine; framing critical thinking as a method of masculine knowers fighting off feminine ‘unreason’. Theorists such as Burrow (2010) have picked up upon this tradition, exploring the ways in which this theme of overly masculine, or ‘adversarial’, argumentation is both unnecessary and serves as an ineffective base for obtaining truth. Rooney (2010) further highlighted how this unnecessarily gendered context results in argumentative double binds for women, undermining their authority and stifling much-needed diversity within philosophy as a discipline.These are damning charges that warrant a response within critical thinking frameworks. We suggest that the broader critical thinking literature, primarily that found within contexts of critical pedagogy and dispositional schools, can and should be harnessed within the critical thinking literature to bridge the gap between classical and feminist thinkers. We highlight several methods by which philosophy can retain the functionality of critical thinking while mitigating the obstacles presented by feminist critics and highlight how the adoption of such methods not only improves critical thinking, but is also beneficial to philosophy, philosophers and feminists alike."
10.1515/dx-2018-0099,Understanding the “philosophy” of laboratory hemostasis,"Abstract
Unlike many other areas of laboratory medicine, laboratory hemostasis has some peculiarities, which makes it one of the most complex diagnostic domains in clinical medicine. The inherent complexity of the hemostasis process, the components of which have not yet been thoroughly unravelled, is mirrored by a large number of hemostasis disturbances, which can involve single or multiple components. Although laboratory diagnostics represents an unavoidable part of the diagnostic reasoning in patients with bleeding or thrombotic disorders, the basic concept beneath the assumption that in many human pathologies, one single test may be sufficient for the diagnosis, does not hold true in hemostasis. There are in fact many aspects that would lead us to conclude that laboratory hemostasis can be considered a very challenging arena for many clinicians and perhaps also for some laboratory professionals. The most challenging aspects typically include the following concepts; that hemostasis is an intricate and multifaceted process, that more than one test is typically needed to achieve a final diagnosis, that results of screening tests depend on many biological factors and do not allow making a final diagnosis, that harmonization of techniques is still an unmet target, and that the calculations used vary widely among laboratories. This article is hence aimed at discussing many of these aspects, with the hope of presenting a useful contribution to better understand the “philosophy” of laboratory hemostasis."

10.1017/s0031819100035646,The Permanent Significance of Hume's Philosophy,"The subject of my lecture is an appropriate one for several reasons. The first is purely chronological. Hume's first and greatest work, theTreatise of Human Nature, was published in 1739, two hundred years ago. Its illustrious author was then quite unknown in the world, and as he tells us himself the book “fell dead-born from the press.” But by the end of the eighteenth century its reputation was securely established, and it has long been regarded as one of the masterpieces of European thought, and as the classical statement of the Empiricist Philosophy. It is true that, like other classics, it has had its ups and downs. During the Absolute Idealist period, which ended early in the present century, Hume was the great bogey-man, and the duty of all self-respecting philosophers was to refute him. In our own day things are different. Empiricism, despite many obituary notices, is very much alive again. And this time it is in close alliance with Natural Science, and has equipped itself with all the technique of modern Symbolic Logic; it is more vigorous in construction and more formidable in criticism than it has ever been before. Consequently Hume is no longer the bogey-man. People now read the Treatise not as an awful warning, but as a source of stimulus and illumination. Incidentally, we can now enjoy his admirable style without any qualms. It is no longer thought that if a philosopher writes in clear and entertaining English, what he writes must therefore be either superficial or false. We regard obscurity and turgidity as demerits, not as signs of profound thinking. Moreover, we have learned to appreciate the eighteenth century, of which Hume was one of the most characteristic products."

This approach represents a change in philosophy for resource management that will require changes in how we view nature, science and politics. This paper draws upon critical theory to examine this shift in philosophy. The paper focuses on the inﬂuence of Enlightenment thought on U.S. Western resource policy and examines four dimensions including the relationship between humans and nature; the concept of rationality; the nature of science; and social relations among humans. Alternative theoretical principles suggested by ecosystem management are discussed. Examples of natural resource management projects that reﬂect ecosystem management in practice are also presented.Keywords: natural resource policy, political thory, ecosystem management, U.S. west land management, critical theory, enlightenment thought."

				This article presents the challenges that mining companies have in the face of the Industry 4.0 philosophy. Transformation of mining businesses into Industry 4.0 appears unavoidable. Due to the specific nature of the sector, the transformation will not be an easy one. This paper discusses the obstacles and challenges related to the transformation of businesses in the mining industry into the Industry 4.0. The history of industrial revolutions was presented, also as the idea of Industry 4.0 with its basic components. The concept of Industry 4.0 is also outlined and the studies which indicate the key issues in the transformation process are also cited. Based on these studies, it can be seen that the vast majority are issues in the field of production engineering and properly educated and qualified staff. Four main areas in which transformation into Industry 4.0 should be taking place are identified. Particular emphasis is placed on the area of technology and organizational culture. The mutual relations of management functions and ICT technologies have also been presented, which is one of the elements of the idea of Industry 4.0. Finally, the potential benefits for the organizational culture of the business of implementing the Industry 4.0 concepts are discussed."

This investigation of spatial literacy was contextualised through the curriculum plan of the College which seeks to educate students through a student-centred curriculum that aims to develop critically aware and culturally sensitive world citizens. The perceptions of key teachers were also examined which revealed their increasing use of school spaces to address political, philosophical and environmental issues in their pedagogical approach."

These two issues were key motivations for this research. Therefore, to achieve the aims of this research, a qualitative approach was used to support the exploratory and descriptive nature of the research. This chapter discusses the justifications for the overall research philosophy and approach subscribed to, and the multiple data collection and data analysis activities used to collect sufficient data to answer the study’s research questions."

The course is distinguished from other courses in that it is based on the Affinity Research Group (ARG) philosophy that focuses on the deliberate development of students’ team, professional and technical skills within a cooperative environment. To address the challenge of having to teach professional and team skills as well as software engineering principles, approaches, techniques, and tools in a capstone course, the authors have defined an approach that uses a continuum of instruction, practice, and application with constructive feedback loops. The authors hope that the readers will benefit from the description of the approach and how ARG components are incorporated into the course. "

This study reports on recent surveys and case studies of organizations which have embarked on IT service management improvement. It highlights specific difficulties experienced by organizations. Six factors were found to be critical in achieving an effective service-oriented philosophy. The factors are support from senior management; the threat or opportunity to outsource IT services; integration of processes to provide end-to-end service; involvement of business stakeholders; culture change of IT staff to service excellence; and the redesign of processes prior to investing in tools. Emergent IT service frameworks such as ISO/IEC 20000, and the CMMI® for Service Delivery are discussed."

10.1093/oso/9780190690649.001.0001,The Philosophy of Science,"Philosophy of science studies the methods, theories, and concepts used by scientists. It mainly developed as a field in its own right during the twentieth century and is now a diversified and lively research area. This book surveys the current state of the discipline by focusing on central themes such as confirmation of scientific hypotheses, scientific explanation, causality, the relationship between science and metaphysics, scientific change, the relationship between philosophy of science and science studies, the role of theories and models, and unity of science. These themes define general philosophy of science. The book also presents subdisciplines in the philosophy of science dealing with the main sciences: logic, mathematics, physics, biology, medicine, cognitive science, linguistics, social sciences, and economics. Although it is common to address the specific philosophical problems raised by physics and biology in such a book, the place assigned to the philosophy of special sciences is much more unusual. Most authors collaborate on a regular basis in their research or teaching and share a common vision of philosophy of science and its place within philosophy and academia in general. The chapters have been written in close accordance with the three editors, thus achieving strong unity of style and tone."

Since Antiquity Phidias seems to be the best sculptor of Gods, because he carved great statues with his human hands and succeeded in giving a physical look to that which is not visible to human eyes. This paper is devoted to Cicero’s attention on the imaginative creation of the artist and on the philosophical features of that demiurgical activity which the Roman philosopher links to his interpretation of the Platonic theory of the Forms. The survey led on some Ciceronian texts shows, from a philosophical and philological point of view, the way in which Cicero reconsiders the role of the phantasia, offering a revalution of the art."

Here I attempt to say something about these questions by commenting specifically on a recent contribution to analytic ideology critique, Jason Stanley’s How Propaganda Works."
10.2307/627697,"The Hot and the Cold, the Dry and the Wet in Greek Philosophy","In a previous article (JHSlxxxii (1962) 56 ff.) I examined some of the theories and explanations which appear in Greek philosophy and medicine in the period down to Aristotle, in which reference is made to right and left or certain other pairs of opposites (light and darkness, male and female, up and down, front and back), and I argued that several of these theories are influenced by the symbolic associations which these opposites possessed for the ancient Greeks. In the present paper I wish to consider the use of the two pairs of opposites which are most prominent of all in early Greek speculative thought, the hot and the cold, and the dry and the wet. My discussion is divided into two parts. In the first I shall examine the question of the origin of the use of these opposites in Greek philosophy. How far back can we trace their use in various fields of speculative thought, and what was the significance of their introduction into cosmology in particular? And then in the second part of my paper I shall consider to what extent theories based on these opposites may have been influenced by assumptions concerning the values of the opposed terms. Are these opposites, too, like right and left, or male and female, sometimes conceived as consisting of on the one hand a positive, or superior pole, and on the other a negative, or inferior one? How far do we find that arbitrary correlations were made between these and other pairs of terms, that is to say correlations that correspond to preconceived notions of value, rather than to any empirically verifiable data?"
10.21476/pp.2015.1125,Every Text is a Performance: A Pre-History of Performance Philosophy,"This article traces a genealogy of performance philosophy along two separate lines within the history of the twentieth-century academy.  On the one hand, it locates within the long history of philosophically-informed studies of dramatic literature a partial model for the work of performance philosophy, one that applied philosophical scrutiny to dramatic texts without ever extending the same consideration to theatrical performance—in spite of the practical theatrical work of many of this movement’s leading academic proponents.  On the other hand, it identifies in the poststructualist rethinking of textual authority an opening for the reconsideration of philosophical communication that returns performance to a place of philosophical potential that it has not securely held since before Plato’s dialogues.  It is argued that the intersection of these two trend lines in academic thought should be regarded as constituting an important intellectual genesis point for the emergence of performance philosophy and a useful means of approaching the purposes and boundary points of the field."

Sufficiency economy philosophy and government support are seen as important covariates that could foster sustainable performance of SMEs. A sample of 119 SME entrepreneurs in the South of Thailand participated in this study. Exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical multiple regression were conducted and the results demonstrated that some dimensions of sufficiency economy philosophy and government support are critical predictors of economic and social performance. Moreover, knowledge and morality are found to promote the principle of sufficiency economy philosophy, as such SME entrepreneurs should be cognizant of the potential effects of this philosophy. The appropriate practices can be equipped and nurtured through the values of sufficiency economy philosophy, which shed light on means to achieve firm sustainability. "

10.1093/obo/9780195396577-0387,Philosophy for Children,"Philosophy for Children is an educational movement that was originally associated with the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC) at Montclair State University (formerly Montclair State College) in the United States beginning in the early 1970s. The term was coined by Matthew Lipman, who was primarily responsible for setting up the institute, after moving from Columbia University in New York, where he first began this work. Lipman and his colleague, Ann Margaret Sharp, promoted Philosophy for Children in the United States and then internationally. It has since attracted the attention of philosophers and educationalists in many parts of the world and both it and its offshoots have become widely represented in schools. Philosophy for Children adapts philosophical subject matter and modes of inquiry for use in school education, either as a separate intervention or by way of integration into existing school subjects. Although philosophy has been traditionally restricted to the senior years, Philosophy for Children is to be found throughout all levels of schooling. This reflects the fact that, while not neglecting the intrinsic value of moral, epistemological, metaphysical, and other philosophical subject matter, it has broader educational objectives. Philosophy for Children is committed to the development of active democratic citizens who have an open inquiring outlook and are prepared to arrive at judgments on the basis of reason and evidence. It supports this outcome through collaborative inquiry-based teaching and learning, treating the classroom as an inquiring community, where emphasis is placed on critical, creative, and caring thinking and the development of associated cognitive and social skills, abilities, and dispositions. A wide array of books for teachers and classroom materials have been produced along with a growing body of research and academic publications in monographs, anthologies, and journals."
10.7311/0860-5734.26.2.06,Lying and Misleading within the Philosophy of Language: A Relevance-Theoretic Perspective,"The aim of the paper is to examine the lying/misleading distinction from a relevance-theoretic perspective (cf. Sperber and Wilson [1986] 1995; 2004; Wilson and Sperber 2002; 2012). On standard accounts, the distinction is drawn parallel to the saying/implicating distinction. ‘What is said’, rooted in Grice (1975), has been subject to extensive discussion and numerous reanalyses under a variety of terms (see, for example, Recanati 1993; Bach 1994; Carston 2002), but no agreement has been reached as to the content of ‘what is said’ and the borderline between ‘what is said’ and ‘what is implicated’. Accordingly, within the philosophy of language the attempts to capture the lying/misleading distinction (Meibauer 2005; 2011; 2014ab; Saul 2012ab; Stokke 2013; 2016) rely on different notions of ‘what is said’. The paper is an attempt to take a stance in the debate on the distinction under discussion from the perspective of Relevance Theory (Sperber and Wilson [1986] 1995; 2004; Wilson and Sperber 2012), which is a cognitive extension and modification of Gricean model of communication and has been seriously concerned with the elaborated concept of what is said, known as ‘explicature’. One of our goals is to see how the relevance-theoretic understanding of “what is said” (Carston 2002; 2009; 2010; Carston and Hall 2012) affects the lying/misleading distinction, and the other way round. In an attempt to provide ground for the relevance-theoretic account, a critical overview and comparison of the existing approaches to lying and misleading is also presented."
10.4018/978-1-59140-553-5.ch107,Critical Realism as an Underlying Philosophy for IS Research,"Many recent articles from within the information systems (IS) arena present an old-fashioned view of realism. For example, Iivari, Hirschheim, and Klein (1998) saw classical realism as seeing “data as describing objective facts, information systems as consisting of technological structures (‘hardware’), human beings as subject to causal laws (determinism), and organizations as relatively stable structures” (p. 172). Wilson (1999) saw the realist perspective as relying on “the availability of a set of formal constraints which have the characteristics of abstractness, generality, invariance across contexts.” "
10.3167/th.2018.6515503,Mental Emancipation in Nnamdi Azikiwe’s Political Philosophy and the Decolonisation of African Knowledge,"This article examines Nnamdi Azikiwe’s idea of mental
emancipation as the intellectual foundation for his political philosophy.
Mental emancipation involves re-educating Africans to adopt scientific,
critical, analytic, and logical modes of thinking. Azikiwe argues that
development must involve changing Africans’ intellectual attitudes and
educational system. He argues that Western education, through perpetuating
negative stereotypes and engendering ‘colonial mentality’,
has neither fostered critical and scientific thinking, nor enabled Africans
to apply their knowledge for development. Mental emancipation would
enable Africans to develop self-confidence, and the critical examination
of superstitious beliefs that have hindered Africa’s development. I show
that Azikiwe’s ideas have been recaptured by African philosophers like
Bodunrin and Wiredu, regarding their critique of aspects of African
tradition and prescription for how African philosophy can contribute to
development."

10.4018/978-1-4666-4995-8.ch005,Feminism and Tenets of Philosophy of Economics,"The neoclassical school of economics does not consider the role of gender in the factors of production. Any production function within the neoclassical paradigm considers labour as a factor of production. However, it does not show how production of any economic output is determined by the type of labour, which is categorized by gender. To illustrate, certain jobs and output might require a skill that can be comparatively better owned by a female than a male. In such cases, the factor labour needs to have a gender, skill attribution within the neoclassical paradigm of production function. Thus, in the present context of neoclassical economics-based production theories, there is a scope of introducing gender discourses. Moreover, resources should also be seen as an important factor of production in the mainstream neoclassical school of thinking. This becomes very important in the context of fast degrading natural resources within the world, which is moving blindly towards a resource-intensive economic growth path. Here, the concept of viewing nature as a mother brings a larger conservative attitude towards nature, which can affect the short term, long term levels of factors of production and, hence, the economic outputs. These facets are totally neglected by the mainstream neoclassical school of thought. This chapter outlines some of these thoughts that affect the economic and social domains of sustainability. "

10.25159/2413-3086/1954,Elements of Environmental Ethics in Ancient Greek Philosophy,"In this article, I consider how ancient Greek philosophical thinking might be approached differently if the environmental ethical import that is salient in it is critically considered. After pointing out how environmental ethics is generally construed in much of the discourse on current philosophical thinking, I spell out some unexplored elements of anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric environmental ethical thinking that are implicit in ancient Greek philosophy. I seek to critically challenge some common notions in Western environmentalism that take environmental ethics as a fairly new discourse of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Ultimately, I suggest that ancient Greek philosophical thinking ought to be judiciously interpreted from an environmental-ethical perspective. Overall, I critically interrogate elements of both anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric environmentalism in ancient Greek thinking, with the intention to examine the contribution of ancient Greek philosophy to environmental ethical thinking."

In the essay we examine the review reports accompanying the rejection of the essay and consider this against the ease with which it was published in a foreign and reputable journal.

A Prescription of a New Theory and Method of Philosophising, in and Beyond African Philosophy","In this paper I discuss the meaning of the theory of conversational philosophy. I show that its background inspiration is derived from an under-explored African notion of relationship or communion or interdependence. I argue that conversational philosophy forms a theoretic framework on which most ethical, metaphysical and epistemological discourses in African philosophy—and by African philosophers—could be grounded. I call this framework the method of conversationalism. I unveil some of its basic principles and show its significance in and beyond African philosophy."
10.25159/2413-3086/3819,QUESTIONS OF CANON FORMATION IN PHILOSOPHY: THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY IN AFRICA,"The history of philosophy is not just an academic discipline, but considered to be a philosophical activity itself. It has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of philosophy, our philosophical canon and curricula. The history of philosophy in Africa is still a young discipline, although philosophical thinking (concepts, manuscripts, books and philosophers) can be traced back until ancient Egypt. Facing the problem of exclusion and inferiorisation of traditions of thought and philosophy in Africa, the discipline of the history of philosophy involves very specific problems and requires a project of “conceptual decolonisation”. This explains both the importance and the difficulty of writing a history of philosophy in Africa."
10.25159/2413-3086/1982,"PLATO’S HERITAGE TO WESTERN PHILOSOPHY, EUROPEAN INTELLECTUAL TRADITION AND SOME SPECIAL SCIENCES","Although the statement of Whitehead, asserting that European philosophy may be seen as footnotes to Plato, is exaggerated, it does provide us with a challenge to explain the element of truth in it. This article investigates a number of philosophical issues surfacing already in pre-Platonic thought in order to show how Plato mediated their impact upon subsequent philosophical developments and philosophical trends within some special sciences. The quest for a principle of origin explored alternative modes of explanation, such as number (the Pythagorean claim that everything is number), the metaphysics of space (Parmenides), the struggle with constancy and change (Heraclitus and Plato) as well as contemplating the limits of conceptual knowledge in Plato’s dialogue, Parmenides. Owing to the philosophical roots of the special sciences, a more detailed account is given of the influence of Platonism upon the disciplines of mathematics, physics and theology."
10.25159/2413-3086/2361,The African Origins of Greek Philosophy: Ancient Egypt in Retrospect,"The demand of philosophising in Africa has faced a history of criticism that has been particularly Eurocentric and strongly biased. However, that trend is changing with the emergence of core philosophical thinking in Africa. This paper is an attempt to articulate a singular issue in this evolution—the originality of African philosophy, through Ancient Egypt and its influence on Greek philosophy. The paper sets about this task by first exposing the historical debate on the early beginnings of the philosophical enterprise, with a view to establishing the possibility of philosophical influences in Africa. It then goes ahead to posit the three hypotheses that link Greek philosophy to have developed from the cultural materiality of Ancient Egypt, and the Eurocentric travesty of history in recognising influences of philosophy as from Europe alone, apart from Egypt."
10.25159/2413-3086/1990,NOTION OF “AFRICAN” AS A STRATEGIC IDEOLOGICAL EPISTEMIC POSITION IN AFRICAN PHILOSOPHY,"This article argues that the racial essentialism implicit in the geographic criteria of the meaning of “African” in African philosophy (as black, ethnic and sub-Saharan) limits the development of African philosophy as a disciplined methodological inquiry into the question of African − and the African question in philosophy. It articulates instead a strategic ideological notion of “African” in African philosophy; defined by a commitment to the ethics of social justice for the historical injustice of racial dehumanisation of Africans, to transcend the racial essentialism implicit in the above geographic criteria of the meaning of “African” in African philosophy."
10.25159/2413-3086/2210,POSTETHNOPHILOSOPHY: DISCOURSES OF MODERNITY AND THE FUTURE OF AFRICAN PHILOSOPHY,"This work examines how the so-called postethnophilosophical phase in African philosophy − propounded by Osha (2011) − fits into the perceived trajectory of the discipline and its overriding emancipatory mandate. The work appropriates ideas from arguably the two most popular “posts”: postmodernism and postcolonialism. This is done to analyse how the postethnophilosophic turn (in its attempt to transcend the discourses of ethnophilosophy and to be postethnophilosophy) opens up new possibilities for African agency and the creation of knowledge. The work argues that postethnophilosophy should concern itself with the analytic task of unmasking the darker side of modernity in order to open up those horizons and experiences once held hostage by modernity and coloniality. It is within this context that a truly global and polycentric knowledge landscape can emerge. In its quest to expose and dismantle hegemonic discourses of colonial modernity, postethnophilosophy finds itself located within the same theoretical horizon occupied by postmodernism and postcolonialism, ready to benefit from their auto-critical habit."

After a discussion of the contemporary context the focus turns specifically to the relevance of race and racism to philosophy and the implications this has for African philosophy in particular. The article then briefly examines the history of Western education and the practice of philosophy in South Africa from the point of view of African philosophy and its marginality in South Africa. "

My aim is to gesture towards how certain ways of doing African philosophy can be considered culturally imperialistic. I seek to illustrate one culturally imperialistic way of doing African philosophy by discussing Thaddeus Metz’s brilliant presentation of Ubuntu as an African moral theory. My motivation is to suggest along the way that his version of an Ubuntu-inspired moral theory seems to me a paradigmatic case of one such way"
10.25159/2413-3086/2211,HYLOZOISM AND HYLOMORPHISM: A LASTING LEGACY OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY,"Apparently philosophical reflection commenced when the awareness of diversity prompted the contemplation of an underlying unity. Thales found this principle of origination in water. Alongside elements such as water, air and fire as well as the apeiron (the infinite-unbounded) Greek philosophy successively explores different modes of explanation. Number, space and movement were succeeded by hulè and morphè, where these two terms at once captured a connection between the (material) world of becoming and the world of organic life. The combination of matter and form (life) gave rise to the two terms of our investigation: hylozoism and hylomorphism. These terms are also related to the act-potency scheme and they also presuppose the relation between primary matter and substantial form. In the thought of Aristotle one can also identify energeia with entelecheia. As soon as one of the two elements present in the two terms hylozoism and hylomorphism is elevated, a monistic perspective ensues, such as found in the opposition of mechanism and vitalism. These extremes sometimes surface in the shape of physicalism and the idea of an immaterial vital force. During and after the Renaissance, the idea of the mechanisation of the universe emerged, while vitalism continued its after-effect within biology, articularly seen in the legacy of idealist morphology (Ray and Linnaeus). The Aristotelian-Thomistic substance-concept appeared to have inherent problems. On the basis of experimental data Driesch revived vitalism (and Aristotle's view of an entelechie), but did not succeed in coming to terms with the physical law of non-decreasing entropy – he had to assign the ability to his entelechie to suspend physical laws in order to account for the increasing order found in growing living entities. However, his neo-vitalist followers further explored Von Bertalanffy's generalisation of the second main law of thermodynamics to open systems. Most recently the idea of a Workmaster (Demiurge) resurfaced in theories of Intelligent Design. These developments are explained by briefly referring to Michael Behe and Stephen Meyer. The historical lines discussed demonstrate how one-sided ismic orientations may make a positive contribution to the identification of unique and irreducible modes of explanation from which scholarly research could still benefit."
10.18267/j.aip.47,Postinternet Marketing: For a Philosophy and Art of Online Marketing,"
While we are living in rapidly changing environment driven by the online services, marketing has been rather reluctant in serious apprehending of these consequences. We do not aim to analyse this complex delay that we call conceptual jetlag here. (Conceptual consciousness of marketing is far behind the velocity of the plane online services.) Rather we try to establish certain switchback that is driven by concept of philosophy by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari and the artistic notion of postinternet. By these means we aim at unveiling the general drive of marketing: The product (take Photoshop as an instance) is meant not only to satisfy our needs and desires. It is creates them. This basic assumption of marketing and the dominance of online environment can elucidate each other since the ""fluid ontology"" of virtual environment consists precisely in the possibility of being formed by the will of its users.

Numerous elements were involved in the seventy years it took to establish its foundation: starting in England and the USA; andragogy and human resource development [HRD]; andragogy and self-directed learning [SDL]; conflict between supporters and detractors; comparing European and USA perspectives; trust in learners’ abilities; scientific foundation of andragogy; skepticism and its counter-balance; and, antecedents of andragogy.

Research on this topic focuses on the cooperation of two authors who have published papers together. However, this paper is exploring the latent association of two authors. By ‘latent association’, we mean that the collaboration between two researchers has not yet occurred but might very likely take place in the future. In this paper, we will aim to find out a couple of authors who have never published together and who bear similar academic interests or study similar subjects. We will also show how the concepts of Yuan (Interdependent arising), Kong (Emptiness), Shi (Energy) and Guanxi (Relationship) in Chinese philosophy contribute to understand ‘latent associations’. These four Chinese concepts are the theoretical basis of this paper. By explaining one by one what each concept is about we hope to tackle the two following questions: What do those four concepts exactly tell us? And how are they linked together? Finally, we will look at the empirical case study in scientometrics. We hope to show that this application of Chinese concepts can unravel latent associations between researchers in Database."
10.4018/978-1-59140-714-0.ch002,The Philosophy of Technology,"We start by outlining some of the problems concerning technology and society that have led people to reflect upon it. One of the most poignant questions is that of “technological determinism” and the extent to which technology is “under control” vs. the extent to which it controls society. The speed of change, the assumption that technology is beneficial, the uptake and geographical spread of technology across cultures, and the extent to which technology creates a never-ending cycle of increased complexity are just some of the “issues” that require examination in the question of technology’s impact upon society."
10.4018/978-1-59140-714-0.ch010,The Philosophy of AI,"As we shall see, the “theology of technology” can help inform the philosophical underpinnings of AI. We start with elucidating the idea of computation, and describe the idea of Turing machine computation. Its equivalence with Post systems and the lambda calculus are explained, and the way that these systems may be regarded as “rule based” and “generative” are brought out. All the equivalent formal models define enumerable languages. However, as Turing’s original definition demonstrated, there are definable numbers that are not computable, that is, a computer could not be used to write some numbers down, yet they exist. The presence of “unsolvable” computational problems also reveals the limitations of Turing machines, and suggests the current limits of computation. While the “intuitive” understanding of computation is one of “step-by-step” algorithmic procedure, it will be hard to conceive of any other computational model."

As outlined at ECAP08, both domains of reality can be characterized by the different logics applicable to them. A new “Logic in Reality” (LIR) was proposed as best describing the dynamics of real, non-computable processes. The LIR process view of the real macroscopic world is compared here with recent computational and information-theoretic models. Proposals that the universe can be described as a mathematical structure equivalent to a computer or by simple cellular automata are deflated. A new interpretation of quantum superposition as supporting a concept of paraconsistent parallelism in quantum computing and an appropriate ontological commitment for computational modeling are discussed."

Thus it is fundamental to distinguish the interventions for the global behavior improvement from those related to local reinforcements. In this chapter is then proposed a scheme of interventions hierarchy and, therefore, a related design process road-map together with the explanation of a correct design philosophy for the static and seismic retrofitting of historical masonry buildings. Moreover it is also reported an example of two distinguished levels of intervention, with numerical analyses supporting that solution. "

Many of the previously well-established principles and values are under examination, and oftentimes are explicitly challenged. Any K-12 academic institution that holds as a central belief that knowledge is individually and socially constructed by learners who are active observers of the world, active questioners, agile problem posers and critical and creative problem solvers, must design, implement and promote an educational philosophy that mirrors the needs described above. This chapter discusses a new educational philosophy (Morfosis) that has been adopted by ACS Athens over the past decade. Morfosis is defined within the 21st Century framework, as a holistic, meaningful, and harmonious educational experience, guided by ethos. The chapter also advances the concept of successful vs. significant institutions, and shares recommendations on how to establish a culture that promotes and establishes the latter. "

Moreover, knowledge and morality are found to promote the principle of sufficiency economy philosophy, as such SME entrepreneurs should be cognizant of the potential effects of this philosophy. The appropriate practices can be equipped and nurtured through the values of sufficiency economy philosophy, which shed light on means to achieve firm sustainability. "

Increasing age results in physical and psychological changes. Life at this age can be challenging, especially from an economic standpoint. Economic protection refers to a sense of safety and protection derived from a solid income or other resources to support present and future needs. People need food, clothing, shelter, and good health to survive. In Islam, this is a basic requirement for human life. Inadequate economic protections contribute to increased poverty and affect the quality of life, contrary to the philosophy of the objectives of Islamic law, which seek to preserve its five major interests: religion, life, property, lineage, and intellect. As a holistic religion, Islam does not ignore economic protection and its role in preserving human life, including for the elderly. This chapter discusses forms of economic protection for the elderly that ensure achievement of the objectives of Islamic law. "

Namely, it is a practical – rather than theoretical – philosophy; indeed, a practice in itself, rather than an analytical pursuit, which is aimed at achieving practical wisdom, rather than theoretical insights. This entails different kinds of practices – from what we would nowadays call moral and political philosophy, in Plato and Aristotle, through a certain kind of interpretive practice, in Heidegger and Gadamer, to a series of neo-pragmatist ways of living, in Rorty and Shusterman. What these have in common is a philosophical focus on what we can do, in our personal, social, and professional lives, rather than what type of theoretical knowledge we can achieve – and how. The former is a kind of philosophy that is more likely to have an impact on the way we live, than on a particular theory or line of arguments. "

            I maintain that an account of knowledge how to do something – an account which might be supposed to uncover ‘the nature’ of such knowledge – can't be got by considering what linguists tell us is expressed in ascriptions of knowing how. Attention must be paid to the knowledge that is actually being exercised when someone is doing something. I criticize some claims about ascriptions of knowledge-how which derive from contemporary syntactic and semantic theory. I argue that these claims can no more provide an understanding of what it is to intend to do something than of what it is to know how to do something. Philosophy, not linguistics, must be the source of such understanding."

10.31219/osf.io/8dnjz,"Integrative biological simulation praxis: Considerations from physics, philosophy, and data/model curation practices","Integrative biological simulations have a varied and controversial history in the biological sciences. From computational models of organelles, cells, and simple organisms, to physiological models of tissues, organ systems, and ecosystems, a diverse array of biological systems have been the target of large-scale computational modeling efforts. Nonetheless, these research agendas have yet to prove decisively their value among the broader community of theoretical and experimental biologists. In this commentary, we examine a range of philosophical and practical issues relevant to understanding the potential of integrative simulations. We discuss the role of theory and modeling in different areas of physics and suggest that certain sub-disciplines of physics provide useful cultural analogies for imagining the future role of simulations in biological research. We examine philosophical issues related to modeling which consistently arise in discussions about integrative simulations and suggest a pragmatic viewpoint that balances a belief in philosophy with the recognition of the relative infancy of our state of philosophical understanding. Finally, we discuss community workflow and publication practices to allow research to be readily discoverable and amenable to incorporation into simulations. We argue that there are aligned incentives in widespread adoption of practices which will both advance the needs of integrative simulation efforts as well as other contemporary trends in the biological sciences, ranging from open science and data sharing to improving reproducibility."
10.1093/oso/9780198801887.001.0001,The Crisis of Method in Contemporary Analytic Philosophy,"The book presents a critique of what has come to be called “the method of cases”—theorizing on the basis of the “application” of words to cases—as well as of the recent debates between “armchair” and “experimental” philosophers concerning that method. It argues that the method of cases as commonly practiced by both armchair and experimental philosophers is underwritten by a “representationalist” conception of language that is philosophically challengeable and empirically poorly supported—a conception on which the primary function of language is to record and communicate “classifications” or “categorizations” of worldly “items,” or “cases”, where what, if any, classifications a word (or expression) is fit to record and communicate, is taken to be determinable apart from any consideration of how it normally and ordinarily functions in discourse. The first part of the book shows that both defenders of the method (Williamson, Cappelen, Jackson, Nagel, and others) and those who have been critical of it (Stich, Cummins, Weinberg, Nado, and others), together with all practitioners of the method—armchair and experimental alike—have shown themselves committed to some version or another of that conception. The second part of the book challenges that conception. Drawing on ideas of Wittgenstein’s and of Merleau-Ponty’s, as well as on empirical studies of first language acquisition, it presents and motivates, both philosophically and empirically, a broadly pragmatist conception of language on which the method of cases as commonly practiced by both armchair and experimental philosophers is fundamentally misguided and bound to lead us astray."
10.2307/1953872,The Public Philosophy: Interest-Group Liberalism,"Until astonishingly recent times American national government played a marginal role in the life of the nation. Even as late as the eve of World War I, the State Department could support itself on consular fees. In most years revenues from tariffs supplied adequate financing, plus a surplus, from all other responsibilities. In 1800, there was less than one-half a federal bureaucrat per 1,000 citizens. On the eve of the Civil War there were only 1.5 federal bureaucrats per 1,000 citizens, and by 1900 that ratio had climbed to 2.7. This compares with 7 per 1,000 in 1940 and 13 per 1,000 in 1962—exclusive of military personnel.The relatively small size of the public sphere was maintained in great part by the constitutional wall of separation between government and private life. The wall was occasionally scaled in both directions, but concern for the proper relation of private life and public order was always a serious and effective issue. Americans always talked pragmatism, in government as in all other things; but doctrine always deeply penetrated public dialogue. Power, even in the United States, needed justification.Throughout the decades between the end of the Civil War and the Great Depression, almost every debate over a public policy became involved in the larger debate over the nature and consequences of larger and smaller spheres of government. This period was just as much a “constitutional period” as that of 1789–1820. Each period is distinguished by its effort to define (or redefine) and employ a “public philosophy.”"
10.1515/sem-2017-0112,Immanuel Kant on the philosophy of communicology: The tropic logic of rhetoric and semiotics,"Abstract
The article consists of a brief biographical account of Immanuel Kant’s life and career, followed by a discussion of his basic philosophy, and a brief discussion of his pivotal point in the history of Rhetoric and Communicology. A major figure in the European Enlightenment period of Philosophy, his Collected Writings were first published in 1900 constituting 29 volumes. He wrote three major works that are foundational to the development of Western philosophy and the human sciences. Often just referred to as the “Three Critiques” informally, the First, the Second, and the Third. These are respectively: The Critique of Pure Reason focused on issues in logic, The Critique of Practical Reason relating ethical guidelines, and The Critique of Judgment exploring issues of aesthetics. He is most famous for his philosophy of transcendental idealism. This version of idealism argues that in logic statements are analytic (subject and predicate are the same; no new information) or synthetic (predicate differs from the subject; new information is constituted). He further argues that statements are a priori (before experience) or a posteriori (a result of experience). Models of rhetoric (tropic logic), phenomenological methodology, and the contemporary Perspectives Model of interpersonal communicology are included as the Kantian legacy in the US. Notes provide a guide to edition and philological issues in the Kantian corpus, especially for the hermeneutics of Vorstellung (‘presentation’) versus Darstellung (‘representation’)."

The result of his reading, lecturing, and thinking over the previous decade, it points the way ahead to his later works, which cannot be understood independently of it. Being and Time is also one of the most difficult books ever written. The work addresses how humans can ask the question ‘What is Being?’ and the temporal nature of the human being (Dasein). A proposed third section of Being and Time considering the question of Being and its relation to time, in greater independence of Dasein, was omitted."
10.1017/s0031819100037943,Modern Moral Philosophy,"I will begin by stating three theses which I present in this paper. The first is that it is not profitable for us at present to do moral philosophy; that should be laid aside at any rate until we have an adequate philosophy of psychology, in which we are conspicuously lacking. The second is that the concepts of obligation, and duty—moralobligation andmoralduty, that is to say—and of what ismorallyright and wrong, and of themoralsense of “ought,” ought to be jettisoned if this is psychologically possible; because they are survivals, or derivatives from survivals, from an earlier conception of ethics which no longer generally survives, and are only harmful without it. My third thesis is that the differences between the wellknown English writers on moral philosophy from Sidgwick to the present day are of little importance."
10.5871/bacad/9780197266298.003.0004,Progress and Historical Reflection in Philosophy,"What is the epistemic significance of reflecting on a discipline’s past for making progress in that discipline? The author assumes that the answer to this question negatively correlates with that discipline’s degree of progress over time. If and only if a science is progressive, then what people have thought and argued in the past in that discipline ceases to be up to date. This chapter distinguishes different dimensions of disciplinary progress and subsequently argue that veritic progress, that is, collective convergence to truth, is the most important dimension for disciplines with scientific ambitions. It then argues that, on the one hand, veritic progress in philosophy is more significant than many current philosophers believe, but that, on the other hand, it also has severe limitations. The author offers an explanation of these limitations that suggests that the history of philosophy should play some role, though only a minor one, in systematic philosophy."
10.5871/bacad/9780197266298.003.0008,The Liaison between Analytic and Ancient Philosophy and Its Consequences,"Is it reasonable to expect that the occupation with history of philosophy contributes to our contemporary philosophical debate? The scholarship on ancient philosophy seems to be a paradigm case for the discussion of this kind of question. In the 1950s and 1960s, philosophers and scholars such as John L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, G.E.L. Owen, John Ackrill and Gregory Vlastos initiated a new style of scholarship that was influenced by analytic philosophy. This analytic style of ancient philosophy scholarship encouraged philosophers to take arguments presented by Plato or Aristotle more seriously and to import ancient ideas into contemporary debates. It was objected that analytic scholars tend to be thematically narrow and to neglect the historical context. By sketching the development of the first two generations of analytic scholarship this chapter tries to show that analytic scholarship need not be anachronistic and that the gain of this method outweighs possible excesses."
10.5871/bacad/9780197266298.001.0001,Philosophy and the Historical Perspective,"Since the rise of analytical philosophy, the relation of philosophy and its past is more hotly debated among philosophers than ever. Some scholars analyse historical texts without reference to current debates and their terminology, while others pursue first-order philosophy by focusing on problems instead of doxography—that is, without reference to their predecessors. A growing group, though, doubts that philosophy can be studied effectively on the basis of this sharp division. But does the study of the history of philosophy contribute to current philosophy? And, if it does, what precisely is the contribution? Does making such a contribution depend on using a specific method which determines how the historical perspective is related to systematic philosophy and philosophy in general? More generally, how do our assumptions about the relationship between historical and systematic perspectives affect our methodology and metaphilosophy or philosophy of philosophy? This volume presents and debates answers to these questions, which deserve to be addressed in their own right and not just as an adjunct to other discussions. The contributors of this volume provide diverse answers based on historical references, stretching from ancient philosophy to the most current debates, and also refer to various philosophical sub-disciplines."
10.5871/bacad/9780197266298.003.0009,The Alienation Effect in the Historiography of Philosophy,"It has often been said that we should enter into a dialogue with thinkers of the past because they discussed the same problems we still have today and presented sophisticated solutions to them. I argue that this ‘dialogue model’ ignores the specific context in which many problems were created and defined. A closer look at various contexts enables us to see that philosophical problems are not as natural as they might seem. When we contextualise them, we experience a healthy alienation effect: we realise that problems discussed in the past depend on assumptions that are far from being self-evident. When we then compare these assumptions to our own, we reflect on our own theoretical framework that is not self-evident either. This leads to a denaturalisation of philosophical problems—in the past as well as in the present. The author argues for this thesis by examining late medieval discussions on mental language."

In six dialogues on light and colours”Abstract: We analyze Elisabeth Carter's 1739 translation of Francesco Algarotti's ""Sir Isaac Newton's philosophy explain'd for the use of ladies. In six dialogues on light and colors. ""We seek to understand the aspects that characterize it as a publication for ladies and to identify possible gender issues. We identified in the work a macho tendency in science and elements that evidence an imaginary that women would not have the qualities necessary to understand science, elements that are consistent with the transition from a period in which women were considered inferior in all respects to a another in which the construction of the maternal role appears as the founder of a conception of woman no longer inferior but fundamentally different from man and with roles complementary to him. We can say that these imaginary can influence the possibilities of participation of women in the scientific enterprise.Keywords:  Science Education, History of Science; Science and Society (Gender). "
10.5871/bacad/9780197266298.003.0005,On Interpreting Historical Texts and Contributing to Current Philosophy,"The chapter discusses four aspects of the question of how we have to interpret historical text in order to make a contribution to current philosophy. It first argues against the dialogue approach, according to which philosophers of the past can be our interlocutors and our interpretations of their texts are dialogues with them. Second, it criticises the Rorschach approach for claiming that our interpretations of the historical texts do not have to be faithful representations of the texts. Third, it is possible that historical text and our current debates concern identical questions but that we should not presuppose transhistorical identity, for there is too much change. Fourth, three types of contexts are distinguished and it is argued that referring to them might enhance the interpretation of the arguments in the texts."
10.5871/bacad/9780197266298.003.0003,Why We Need a Real History of Philosophy,"The main value of the history of philosophy is not in how philosophers can use it, but its intrinsic value as an independent discipline. A ‘real history of philosophy’ maximises this value. It must meet criteria with regard to method, breadth and comprehensiveness. The method of approach requires a rejection of the usual division of labour between history of philosophy and intellectual history. Although analytical historians rarely recommend such a method in theory, they often follow it in practice. But, as a field, analytic history of philosophy fails drastically in breadth and comprehensiveness. It is highly concentrated around a short list of names, historically on just two short periods, and geographically on a small area within the broad Western tradition. As a result, students of analytical philosophy are likely to finish their courses more ignorant of the real history of their subject than when they began."
10.5871/bacad/9780197266298.003.0012,The History of Philosophy Reveals that ‘Great’ Philosophy is Disguised Moral Advocacy: A Nietzschean Case against the Socratic Canon in Philosophy,"Instrumentalists think the history of philosophy is as relevant to philosophy as the history of physics is to physics: if past philosophical or physical theories are true, or help us get to the truth, then we should know about them, otherwise not. Sceptical instrumentalists (such as Carnap and Quine) think history fails on these counts, optimistic instrumentalists think it does not. By contrast ‘anti-philosophical’ instrumentalists—such as Marx, Nietzsche and Wittgenstein—are not simply sceptics, because the sceptics still believe there is something for philosophy to do, some knowledge it can produce, some truths it can reveal. The anti-philosophical philosophers think we should give up philosophy as traditionally conceived: the real lesson from the history of philosophy in the Socratic canon is that philosophy is ‘garbage’, or, as Nietzsche thought, disguised moral advocacy. For Nietzsche, this is the real lesson of the history of philosophy."
10.5871/bacad/9780197266298.003.0015,History as an Interdisciplinary Dialogue: The Case of Philosophy and Economics,"This chapter explores the history of philosophy as a resource for interdisciplinary research, drawing on the author’s work on Smith and Hegel for illustration. It briefly sketches some aspects of the relation between political philosophy and economics, and then describes a ‘post-Skinnerian’ approach to the history of philosophy that enters into a dialogue with historical thinkers, taking seriously their historical context but ultimately aiming at answering systematic questions. This approach allows us to garner the insights of thinkers who reflected in an integrated way about questions that today belong to different disciplines. It can help us to uncover implicit assumptions or theoretical gaps in contemporary approaches that are made invisible by the separation of research into different disciplinary fields. The chapter concludes by suggesting that the history of philosophy can inspire us to question the boundaries of disciplines and explore new avenues of research."
10.5871/bacad/9780197266298.003.0010,What Has History to Do with Philosophy? Insights from the Medieval Contemplative Tradition,"This chapter focuses on the corrective and complementary roles that a historically oriented approach can occupy in philosophical discussions. First, it argues that analysis of the development of key definitions, concepts, principles and so forth can often illuminate problematic prejudices that should motivate a re-examination of the philosophical considerations in their favour. Second, it claims that this re-examination should involve looking at the relevant historical context in which the idea developed. Third, it demonstrates (via the case study of medieval mysticism and modern conceptions of mystical experience) that turning to the relevant historical context can sometimes provide viable philosophical resources with which to complement existing discussions. The chapter concludes by suggesting that this approach can also help philosophers engage in meaningful interaction with scholars working on similar topics in other disciplines."
10.5871/bacad/9780197266298.003.0006,"Meaning, the History of Philosophy, and Analytical Philosophy: A Parmenidean Ascent","This chapter seeks to shed light on the relation between philosophy and the study of the history of philosophy by resisting certain misconceptions of this relation both on the part of relatively anti-historical analytical philosophers and on the part of certain apparently pro-historical historians of philosophy. The vehicle of this resistance is a Bradleyan argument that isolates the source of these failures and advances a radical holism of meaning. Once this radical holism of meaning is in place, we will be in a position to make a Parmenidean Ascent with regard to meaning and to take up a wholly new perspective on the relation between philosophy and its history."

While research has developed an understanding of the student learning experience, less attention has been paid to the role of the lecturer. This study observed the practice of university lecturers teaching in a range of undergraduate degree programmes in the United Kingdom. The lecturers’ purpose, pedagogy, and philosophy emerged in the dialogic patterns of the online space. Practice was shaped by the lecturers’ epistemological positioning and their cultural values and beliefs. The practice, which was observed across different modules, reflected the different positions lecturers took when they approached online teaching. The research highlights the way in which a lecturers’ purpose, pedagogy, and philosophy are reflected in their online facilitation.&lt;/p&gt;"
10.1093/oso/9780198807520.001.0001,Philosophy Within Its Proper Bounds,"In Philosophy Within Its Proper Bounds, Edouard Machery argues that resolving many traditional and contemporary philosophical issues is beyond our epistemic reach and that philosophy should reorient itself toward more humble, but ultimately more important intellectual endeavors. Attempts to resolve such issues are modally immodest: Any resolution would require an epistemic access to metaphysical possibilities and necessities, which, Edouard Machery argues, we do not have. In effect, then, Philosophy Within Its Proper Bounds defends a form of modal skepticism. The book assesses the main philosophical method for acquiring the modal knowledge that the resolution of modally immodest philosophical issues turns on: the method of cases, that is, the consideration of actual or hypothetical situations (which cases or thought experiments describe) in order to determine what facts hold in these situations. Canvassing the extensive work done by experimental philosophers over the last fifteen years, Edouard Machery shows that the method of cases is unreliable and should be rejected. Importantly, the dismissal of modally immodest philosophical issues is no cause for despair: Many important philosophical issues remain within our epistemic reach. In particular, reorienting the course of philosophy would free time and resources for bringing back to prominence a once-central intellectual endeavor: conceptual analysis."
10.3366/edinburgh/9781474418874.001.0001,Simone de Beauvoir's Philosophy of Individuation,"Most studies of Simone de Beauvoir situate her with respect to Hegel and the tradition of 20th-century phenomenology begun by Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty. This book analyzes The Second Sex in light of the concepts of becoming, problematization, and the Other found in Gilles Deleuze. Reading Beauvoir through a Deleuzian lens allows more emphasis to be placed on Beauvoir's early interest in Bergson and Leibniz, and on the individuation of consciousness, a puzzle of continuing interest to both phenomenologists and Deleuzians.
By engaging with the philosophical issues in her novels and student diaries, this book rethinks Beauvoir’s focus on recognition in The Second Sex in terms of women’s struggle to individuate themselves despite sexist forms of representation. It shows how specific forms of women’s “lived experience” can be understood as the result of habits conforming to and resisting this sexist “sense.” Later feminists put forward important criticisms regarding Beauvoir’s claims not to be a philosopher, as well as the value of sexual difference and the supposedly Eurocentric universalism of her thought. Deleuzians, on the other hand, might well object to her ideas about recognition. This book attempts to address those criticisms, while challenging the historicist assumptions behind many efforts to establish Beauvoir’s significance as a philosopher and feminist thinker. As a result, readers can establish a productive relationship between Beauvoir’s “problems” and those of women around the world who read her work under very different circumstances."
10.5622/illinois/9780252041754.003.0002,Jacek Dukaj’s Science Fiction as Philosophy,"This chapter focuses on Jacek Dukaj, arguably the most interesting voice in contemporary Polish science fiction: the author of six long novels, four long novellas/short novels, and a number of shorts stories, he is also a ten-time nominee and six-time winner of the Janusz Zajdel Award, as well as a recipient of the 2008 European Union Prize for Literature. Dukaj is not only a true heir to Stanisław Lem but, arguably, overshadows the Polish master in terms of narrative complexity and intellectual density. Characterized by narrative, philosophical, and aesthetic complexity, Dukaj’s prose lends itself to a number of readings and approaches, but three aspects of his writing make him unique, both domestically and in a broader context: the genre-bending versatility of his fiction; the unusual dynamic between the practice of worldbuilding and narrative plotting; and the degree to which the author uses science fiction to engage a number of political, social, and cultural aspects of Polish society. In all three spheres, he combines cutting-edge artistry with a critical attitude towards the science-fiction tradition at large and specific scientific, intellectual, and political discourses."

10.23943/princeton/9780691180502.003.0003,Philosophy in the Cosmogonies,"This chapter examines the origins of Greek philosophy in the context of the cosmogonies. It begins with an analysis of Hesiod's poem Theogony, which describes the genealogies of the Greek gods and delineates a picture of the origin of the cosmos. It then considers the cosmogony of Anaximander of Miletus, with a particular focus on his theory of celestial bodies which ascribes the origin of the cosmos to an entity called apeiron. It also discusses a historical framework in which philosophy starts as cosmogony and is a daughter of the polis, along with Aristotle's view regarding the theologians' cosmogonies. The chapter goes on to explore Pherecydes of Syros's “mixed theology,” which combines traditional elements with his personal reflections on the problem of the origin of the cosmos, before concluding with a commentary on whether Thetis is a divine figure endowed with conscious control of the “ways” of the cosmos."
10.23943/princeton/9780691180502.001.0001,The Beginnings of Philosophy in Greece,"How can we talk about the beginnings of philosophy today? How can we avoid the conventional opposition of mythology and the dawn of reason and instead explore the multiple styles of thought that emerged between them? This book, available in English for the first time, reconstructs the intellectual world of the early Greek “Presocratics” to provide a richer understanding of the roots of what used to be called “the Greek miracle.” The beginnings of the long process leading to philosophy were characterized by intellectual diversity and geographic polycentrism. In the sixth and fifth centuries BC, between the Asian shores of Ionia and the Greek city-states of southern Italy, thinkers started to reflect on the cosmic order, elaborate doctrines on the soul, write in solemn Homeric meter, or, later, abandon poetry for an assertive prose. And yet the Presocratics, whether the Milesian natural thinkers, the rhapsode Xenophanes, the mathematician and “shaman” Pythagoras, the naturalist and seer Empedocles, the oracular Heraclitus, or the inspired Parmenides, all shared an approach to critical thinking that, by questioning traditional viewpoints, revolutionized knowledge. The book explores the full range of early Greek thinkers in the context of their worlds, and it also features a new introduction to the English edition in which the author discusses the latest scholarship on the subject."
10.23943/princeton/9780691180502.003.0002,"Thales, Father of Philosophy?","This chapter examines whether Thales is indeed the “father of philosophy” as declared by Aristotle. It first considers the theories of two interpreters, Francis MacDonald Cornford and Walter Burkert, regarding the origin of Greek philosophy before discussing the concept of muthos. In particular, it explores the problem of the cognitive status of myth in Greek thought and Aristotle's position regarding myth as articulated in the first book of Metaphysics. In reflecting upon the origin of the philosophical enterprise, Aristotle ascribes to “those who first philosophized” an interest in the “principle” (archē) of things. The chapter explains how the search for the archē started by Thales contributed to an understanding of the nature of things. Finally, it analyzes the pluralism of knowledge and styles of reasoning that characterize the intellectual enterprise of the sixth and fifth centuries BCE."
10.15173/jhap.v6i3.3431,"Helmholtz and Philosophy: Science, Perception, and Metaphysics, with Variations on Some Fichtean Themes","This article considers Helmholtz’s relation to philosophy, including Fichte’s philosophy. Recent interpreters find Fichtean influence on Helmholtz, especially concerning the role of voluntary movement in distinguishing subject from object, or “I” from “not-I.” After examining Helmholtz’s statements about Fichte, the article describes Fichte’s ego-doctrine and asks whether Helmholtz could accept it into his sensory psychology. He could not accept Fichte’s core position, that an intrinsically active I intellectually intuits its own activity and posits the not-I as limiting and determining that activity, because that account requires cognitive abilities that conflict with Helmholtz’s claim that the development of spatial perception relies primarily on associative memory and involves no direct awareness of the ego’s activity as such. Helmholtz would have known various accounts of the distinction between subject and object, or self and world, from sensory physiology, including associative accounts invoking voluntary motor movements and accounts describing checks on the perceiver’s activity. Some of the accounts cite Fichte on the I and not-I, but most do not, and none adopt Fichte’s Idealism. Finally, the article examines Helmholtz’s relation to metaphysics, finding that in all periods he rejected Fichtean Idealism and that the modest metaphysics of his mature period is a version of structural realism."
10.5840/beq200616327,Is Philosophy Relevant to Applied Ethics?,"Abstract:
            If, like Hegel and Dewey, one takes a historicist, anti-Platonist view of moral progress, one will be dubious about the idea that moral theory can be more than the systematization of the widely-shared moral intuitions of a certain time and place. One will follow Shelley, Dewey, and Patricia Werhane in emphasizing the role of the imagination in making moral progress possible. Taking this stance will lead one to conclude that although philosophy is indeed relevant to applied ethics, it is not more relevant than many other fields of study (such as history, law, political science, anthropology, literature, and theology)."
10.1093/oso/9780190883959.001.0001,Tibetan Buddhist Philosophy of Mind and Nature,"This book offers an engaging philosophical overview of Tibetan Buddhist thought. It shows the way that Buddhist theory informs Buddhist practice across various Tibetan traditions in ways that integrate competing and complimentary perspectives on the nature of mind and reality. The book draws upon a contrast between phenomenology and ontology to highlight distinct starting points of inquiries into mind and nature in Buddhism and to illuminate central issues confronted in Tibetan Buddhist philosophy. It argues that these starting points share a common ground and can be seen to be actually inseparable. This thematic study raises some of the most difficult and critical topics in Buddhist thought, such as the nature of mind and the meaning of emptiness, across a wide range of philosophical traditions, including the “Middle Way” of Madhyamaka, Yogācāra (a.k.a. “Mind-Only”), and tantra. This book provides a richly textured overview that explores the intersecting nature of mind, language, and world depicted across Tibetan Buddhist traditions. It also puts Tibetan philosophy into conversation with texts and traditions from India, Europe, and America, exemplifying the possibility and potential for a transformative conversation in global philosophy."
10.1093/oso/9780190880668.003.0008,Who Knows?,"An aspect of proposing a definition of a science of social work is defining the domains that it should or could address. Critical realism calls for examining and critiquing the social arrangements that frame our science and our knowledge. Like social work itself, it aspires to be an emancipatory project. The concept of embodiment from philosophy of mind is introduced; it suggests that a mind, whether the same or different from a brain, is embedded in the organism, the social world, the cultural world that includes the historical, and the ecological world. This framework has implications for understanding how we know and what we need to know. Embodiment is a concept that can be used in defining the scope and concerns of social work science."

                  Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy provides, twice each year, a collection of the best current work in the field of ancient philosophy. Each volume features original essays that contribute to an understanding of a wide range of themes and problems in all periods of ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, from the beginnings to the threshold of the Middle Ages. From its first volume in 1983, OSAP has been a highly influential venue for work in the field, and has often featured essays of substantial length as well as critical essays on books of distinctive importance. Volume LV contains: a methodological examination on how the evidence for Presocratic thought is shaped through its reception by later thinkers, using discussions of a world soul as a case study; an article on Plato’s conception of flux and the way in which sensible particulars maintain a kind of continuity while undergoing constant change; a discussion of J. L. Austin’s unpublished lecture notes on Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics and his treatment of loss of control (akrasia); an article on the Stoics’ theory of time and in particular Chrysippus’ conception of the present and of events; and two articles on Plotinus, one that identifies a distinct argument to show that there is a single, ultimate metaphysical principle; and a review essay discussing E. K. Emilsson’s recent book, Plotinus."
10.17990/rpf/2018_74_4_1493,Jani Christou and the Philosophy of Meta-Music,"Jani Christou (1926–1970) was among the most exciting and provocative figures of the twentieth-century musical avant-garde, introducing a body of work of rigorous consistency that integrates philosophical aspects and notions. His contribution to the sonic world goes beyond the strictly musical innovations in terms of technique and style. This article explores the intellectual notions that this great thinker embodied functionally in his compositions, offering a broader inspiration that relates to human expressive needs. Having been educated under philosophers rather than musicians, Christou manifested a unique attitude towards art which interconnects music, contemplation and one’s way of living."

The isomorphism between language and reality and the different types of propositions formulated by the first Wittgenstein represent a new conception of music in the composer.

Mathematics and logic have been central topics of concern since the dawn of philosophy. Since logic is the study of correct reasoning, it is a fundamental branch of epistemology and a priority in any philosophical system. Philosophers have focused on mathematics as a case study for general philosophical issues and for its role in overall knowledge-gathering. Today, philosophy of mathematics and logic remain central disciplines in contemporary philosophy, as evidenced by the regular appearance of articles on these topics in the best mainstream philosophical journals; in fact, the last decade has seen an explosion of scholarly work in these areas. This volume covers these disciplines, giving the reader an overview of the major problems, positions, and battle lines. The twenty-six articles are by established experts in the field, and these articles contain both exposition and criticism as well as substantial development of their own positions."
10.18357/ijih121201716905,The effect of a 12-week exercise and lifestyle management programme on cardiac risk reduction: A pilot using a kaupapa Māori philosophy,"&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of premature death and disability for all New Zealanders. Māori, the Indigenous people of New Zealand, are disproportionately affected. The New Zealand Māori Health Strategy recognises that “health and wellbeing are influenced and affected by the ‘collective’ … and the importance of working with people in their social contexts, not just with their physical symptoms” (Ministry of Health, 2002, p. 1). In a Māori worldview, a holistic approach to health is innate. Objectives: This project piloted a kaupapa Māori approach within an existing 12-week clinical exercise and lifestyle management programme. The aims of the study were to determine the effectiveness of a kaupapa Māori 12-week exercise and lifestyle management programme on parameters of cardiac risk and quality of life. Methods: 12 Māori participants attended, 3 times per week over a 12-week period, for monitored, supervised, and individualised exercise. Participants performed a progressive aerobic-only programme for 6 weeks and then a combined aerobic and resistance training programme from weeks 7 through 12. Education sessions were chosen by participants. Results: There was a statistically significant improvement in waist circumference (–3.7 cm; p = .05), hip circumference (–4.6 cm; p = .03), systolic blood pressure (–22 mm Hg; p = .01), and HDL cholesterol (0.22 mmol/L; p = .01). In addition, physical (p = .05) and overall (p = .03) quality of life improved. Conclusion: A kaupapa Māori approach within a structured lifestyle management programme modifies cardiac risk parameters in Māori.&lt;/p&gt;"
10.1093/oso/9780199300518.001.0001,A Philosophy for the Science of Well-Being,"Well-being, happiness, and quality of life are now established objects of social and medical research. Does this science produce knowledge that is properly about well-being? What sort of well-being? The definition and measurement of these objects rest on assumptions that are partly normative, partly empirical, and partly pragmatic, producing a great diversity of definitions depending on the project and the discipline. This book, written from the perspective of philosophy of science, formulates principles for the responsible production and interpretation of this diverse knowledge. Traditionally, a philosopher’s goal has been a single concept of well-being and a single theory about what it consists in. But for science this goal is both unlikely and unnecessary. Instead the promise and authority of the science depends on it focusing on the well-being of specific kinds of people in specific contexts. Sceptical arguments notwithstanding, this contextual well-being can be measured in a valid and credible way—but only if scientists broaden their methods to make room for normative considerations and address publicly and inclusively the value-based conflicts that inevitably arise when a measure of well-being is adopted. The science of well-being can be normative, empirical, and objective all at once, provided that we line up values to science and science to values."

10.15388/problemos.2013.0.1780,TWO METAPHORS OF MEMORY IN EARLY MODERN PHILOSOPHY,"The article analyses the relation between two metaphors of memory: project and repository. These ancient metaphors in early modern philosophy describe memory as the origin of such a duration which is the foundation of autonomy of contemplating being. That description gives the opportunity to answer the questions: what is the necessity of memory, what is memorabilia (and why memory and mnemonical things are essentially the same), and what it means to remember “by heart”. The concept of duration, which is central for Bergson’s philosophy, has its roots in early modern thinking and is strongly connected with a special kind of memory machine: machine without movement.Keywords: memory, duration, contraposition of memory and history, memory machinesDvi atminties metaforos ankstyvoje moderniojoje filosofijojeEugeny Malyshkin

10.15388/problemos.2012.0.726,UNITY IN ANCIENT AND MODERN PHILOSOPHY AND THE HYPOTHESIS OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY,"The paper argues for three things. First, that the abstract concepts of ancient Greek and modern mathematics are fundamentally different. The general treatment of mathematical things in ancient Greek mathematics manifestly does not presuppose a general mathematical object, while in modern mathematics the generality of the method presupposes precisely such a general mathematical object. Two, that this difference in abstract concepts of mathematics makes a difference in our understanding of a discipline other than mathematics, specifically, in the discipline of history. And, three, that what is at issue in this difference is whether it is necessary for human beings to understand themselves from the perspective of history in order to understand themselves properly as human.Keywords: mathematical objects, concept of number, history, self-consciousness.Vienumas antikos ir naujųjų laikų filosofijoje ir visuotinės istorijos hipotezėBurt C. HopkinsSantraukaŠiame straipsnyje ginamos trys tezės. Pirma, kad abstrakčios antikos ir naujųjų laikų matematikos sąvokos yra fundamentaliai skirtingos. Bendras matematinių dalykų traktavimas antikos matematikoje akivaizdžiai nesuponuoja tokios matematinio objekto sąvokos, kokią numato naujųjų laikų matematikos metodas. Antra, šis abstrakčių matematikos sąvokų skirtingumas turi įtakos kitos, nematematinės disciplinos, o būtent – istorijos, supratimui. Trečia, šio skirtumo esminis aspektas yra klausimas, ar savęs kaip žmogaus suvokimui būtina suprasti save iš istorijos perspektyvos.Pagrindiniai žodžiai: matematiniai objektai, skaičiaus sąvoka, istorija, savimonė."
10.1093/oso/9780198834106.003.0015,Is Plantinga-Style Christian Philosophy Really Philosophy?,"In this chapter John Schellenberg defends the proposal that the intellectual activity associated with Alvin Plantinga’s work on religion, a Reformed sort of Christian philosophy (RCP), isn’t properly regarded as being philosophy at all—not even philosophy of religion. Instead, Schellenberg argues that it is theology. He begins by clarifying how RCP should be understood. Then he presents and defends a condition he calls the Communal Condition, which says that to be doing philosophy one must aim not just to solve certain fundamental problems, or contribute thereto, but to do so together with like-minded others in a shared enterprise leading to informed consensus. Finally, Schellenberg defends the view that, although it satisfies very well a condition sufficient for something to count as theology, RCP cannot satisfy the Communal Condition."
10.1093/oso/9780198834106.003.0010,Christian Philosophy and Disability Advocacy,"In this chapter, Kevin Timpe explores a number of similarities between one approach to Christian philosophy and disability advocacy. Both tasks are normatively loaded in that they assume certain views about truth, the good life, the extant and source of value. Both are hermeneutically situated, shaped by their historical contexts, and as a result are also developmental—i.e., the particular normative agenda changes as the context develops. Finally, Timpe argues that Christian philosophy and disability are inherently communal, both in that they’re done communally and also that they have communal effects."
10.1093/oso/9780198834106.003.0017,Beyond Two-Valued Logics,"For this Jewish philosopher, the turn to Christian philosophy, stimulated by Alvin Plantinga and others, was a welcome event, challenging the hegemonic modern model of rationality. Twenty years later, Peter Ochs remains hopeful about the turn to Christian philosophy, but is also disappointed. He is hopeful because this turn has encouraged turns to other scripturally grounded traditions of rationality as well, including Jewish philosophy. He is also disappointed because the largest sub-society of Christian philosophers has tended to uphold the hegemony of the modern model of logic: practicing and promoting types of two-valued, propositional logic as the standard model of rationality even when applied to subjects toward which Christianity has privileged access. While his appreciation for the turn to Christian philosophy is stronger than his disappointments, he focuses here on the disappointments alone, so that, with limited space, he can address them more fully."
10.1093/oso/9780198834106.003.0014,Christian Philosophy and Christ Crucified,"What is distinctive about Christian philosophy? The history of Christian philosophy does not offer a consensus answer, and much of this history fails to offer a definite answer. One result is a widespread lack of understanding of what this Christian discipline consists of. In this chapter, Paul K. Moser contends that genuine Christian philosophy is Christ-shaped in putting the person of the crucified Christ at its center. Moser draws from the personalism of the apostle Paul regarding divine wisdom to clarify what is distinctive in Christian philosophy. He characterizes the relevant evidence for God in Christ crucified as scandalous power in its being contrary to human expectations. He also finds that the evidence is fragmentary relative to an adequate “worldview,” because it fails to answer many pressing questions, including many questions about unjust suffering. Moser names “resurrectionitis” as part of the problem: that is, an emphasis on the divine power of resurrection to the relative neglect of Christ crucified."
10.1093/oso/9780198834106.003.0013,The Strategies of Christian Philosophy,"In this chapter, J. Aaron Simmons argues that philosophers who are Christians now find themselves in a situation where continuing to engage in Christian philosophy, in the technical sense as laid out by Plantinga, is likely to be a problematic strategy on three fronts. Philosophically, it is problematic because it can close down potential lines of inquiry that might profitably be pursued and, thereby, lead to a problematic professional insularity. Theologically, it is problematic because it can lead to theological triumphalism and arrogance that cut against the humility and invitation found in the example of Christ. And socially, it is problematic because it can foster extremism at the level of one’s justificatory appeals. Simmons concludes by suggesting that Merold Westphal offers an approach to Christian philosophy that is well suited to the contemporary situation."
10.1093/oso/9780198834106.003.0004,Christian Philosophy and the Christian Life,"In this chapter, Kyla Ebels-Duggan considers how Christian philosophers should decide which questions are worth asking. She provides an interpretation and defense of Alvin Plantinga’s claim that Christian philosophers should strive for autonomy, and then argues that this rules out some ways of settling on our questions. Ebels-Duggan then suggests that the questions in which Christian philosophers should take an interest are those arising from or continuous with a distinctively Christian way of life. Along the way she argues that the power of the distinctive tools of philosophy is importantly limited: reasoning alone cannot settle either which questions we should ask or which commitments we should take on."
10.1093/oso/9780199916429.003.0002,Health and Philosophy in Pre- and Early Imperial China,"Though there was no single Chinese term that corresponds to the English word health, there were a variety of theories about bodily ideals. This chapter follows these theories through three periods of early Chinese history. A key notion is qi, or “vital breath,” that circulates through the body to preserve health; learning methods of breath control can thus prolong life. So-called “Daoist” philosophy draws a parallel between health in the individual and good order in the state, as well as nature or the cosmos as a whole, an idea furthered in medical works of the Han dynasty."
10.1093/oso/9780199916429.003.0004,The Soul’s Virtue and the Health of the Body in Ancient Philosophy,"This chapter undertakes a comparison between ancient philosophy and ancient medicine, showing that in Greek works and texts of the Roman period a parallel was drawn between the therapeutic art of medicine for the body and philosophy as a form of therapy in its own right. Attention is also paid to the epistemological dimension of medicine, with a variety of thinkers taking different stances on the kind of knowledge available to medicine and its sources. Do doctors have a mere “knack” for curing like rhetoricians with their art of persuasion, or is medicine a science in the full and proper sense? Authors and traditions covered include Plato, the Stoics, the Epicureans, and the Pyrrhonist Skeptics, as well as medical thinkers like Diocles and Herophilus."
10.1093/oso/9780198834106.003.0006,The Two-Fold Task of Christian Philosophy of Religion,"Using Pierre Hadot’s idea of “philosophy as a way of life,” Bruce Ellis Benson argues that Christian philosophy of religion is ultimately about the practical task of living our lives. But he contends that this task is two-fold: it includes both theory and also practice. While analytic philosophy of religion (APR) tends to emphasize theory and continental philosophy of religion (CPR) tends to emphasize practice (admittedly, these generalizations are only true to a certain extent), APR and CPR are both part of a two-fold task. Throughout the chapter, Benson puts into question any hard distinction between theory and practice."
10.1093/oso/9780198834106.003.0003,“Christian Philosophy”,"In this chapter, Jean-Luc Marion offers a sweeping account of the history of recent Christian philosophy (especially in light of the debates between Émile Bréhier and Étienne Gilson). Arguing that the majority of Christian philosophy has functioned according to a “hermeneutic” approach, Marion suggests that far from being marginalized in recent history, Christian philosophy has been quite prominent. Despite the substantial pedigree of hermeneutic Christian philosophy, Marion considers three objections to it as the best way forward. Proposing instead a “heuristic” approach that allows for a specifically phenomenological conception of revelation and charity, Marion attempts to open new spaces for thinking about Christian philosophy in ways that are both philosophically substantive and theologically responsible."
10.1093/oso/9780198834106.003.0016,"Philosophy, Religion, and Worldview","Alvin Plantinga’s “Advice to Christian Philosophers” begins with a triumphalist narrative that forms the backdrop for the advice to Christian philosophers. In this chapter Graham Oppy argues (a) that the triumphalist narrative is over-egged, and (b) that what is of value in the advice applies to all philosophers, Christian or otherwise. Oppy’s critique of the triumphalist narrative is based on demographic and other data that suggests that while (a) we have no reason to think that there is a higher percentage of Christians in academic philosophy now than there was in the late 1940s (and, indeed, we may even have good reason to think that there is a lower percentage of Christians in academic philosophy now than there was in the late 1940s), (b) we do have reason to think that there is a larger absolute number of Christians in academic philosophy now than there was in the late 1940s."
10.1093/oso/9780198834106.003.0009,Discerning the Spirit,"In this chapter, Neal DeRoo argues that the primary task of Christian philosophy is discerning the “spirit” of the age and not merely offering rational defenses of theism. It begins by articulating the notion of “spirit” (drawn from the later Husserl) that is at work in this chapter. Then it articulates a philosophical anthropology that makes clear how such “spirit” is pre-theoretically operative as a dynamic, religious force in all human action. Next, it argues that discerning, articulating, and clarifying the nature of this “spirit” as it functions in a particular culture or community is the task of Christian philosophy. It ends by showing how diagnosing these spirits of the age is not only an intellectual project, but enables the Christian philosopher to provide a concrete service to the broader Christian community."

10.22555/joeed.v2i2.446,John Dewey and His Philosophy of Education,"This review paper on John Dewey, the pioneering educationist of the 20th century, discusses his educational thoughts, and writings, which gave a new direction to education at the turn of the century. Dewey’s contributions are immense and overwhelming in the fields of education, politics, humanism, logic, and aesthetics. This discussion will focus on Dewey and his philosophy related to educational approaches, pedagogical issues, and the linkages that he made between education, democracy, experience, and society. At the heart of his educational thought is the child. Dewey’s idea on humanism springs from his democratic bent and his quest for freedom, equity, and the value of child’s experiences."
10.1515/auk-2009-0201,Experimental Philosophy,"AbstractExperimental philosophy is a new approach to philosophy that incorporates the experimental methodologies of psychology, behavioral economics, and sociology. Experimental philosophers generally maintain that, in addition to traditional philosophical practices, these ways of gathering evidence can be instrumental in shedding light on philosophically important issues. Rather than relying on their own intuitions about specific cases, experimental philosophers perform systematic experiments to determine what intuitions people have about those cases. These intuitions are then used as evidence. In this context, four main approaches to experimental philosophy are introduced, a sample of experimental philosophy's results is offered, and some of the philosophical importance of those results is explained."
10.5871/bacad/9780197266298.003.0001,Philosophy and the Historical Perspective: A New Debate on an Old Topic,"Since the rise of analytical philosophy, the relation of current philosophy and its past is more hotly debated among philosophers than ever. In this Introduction, I first explain the main questions of this debate: Does the study of the history of philosophy contribute to philosophy? What is this contribution? Is there a specific method relating the historical perspective to current philosophy? What does this mean for our view on philosophy in general? Second, I critically discuss doubts about the usefulness of the debate and defend its importance. Third, I briefly discuss the relation of the historical perspective and its relation to the philosophy of philosophy, and finally I summarize the evolution of the debate and some of its main positions."
10.2307/421204,Formalization in Philosophy,AbstractThe advantages and disadvantages of formalization in philosophy are summarized. It is concluded that formalized philosophy is an endangered speciality that needs to be revitalized and to increase its interactions with non-formalized philosophy. The enigmatic style that is common in philosophical logic must give way to explicit discussions of the problematic relationship between formal models and the philosophical concepts and issues that motivated their development.
10.5949/liverpool/9781781382561.001.0001,"Positivism, Science and 'The Scientists' in Porfirian Mexico","This book is intended for not only students and academics who undertake research on the history of Mexico during the half-century prior to the onset in 1910 of the Mexican Revolution, but also the parallel community of specialists on the history of ideas, philosophy and science throughout Latin America in this period. Its principal focus is to revisit the influential thesis of the Mexican philosopher Leopoldo Zea that the ideological group dubbed ‘the scientists’ by their opponents were guided by Positivism, particularly as interpreted by Herbert Spencer. It begins by reviewing previous research upon the formation and differentiation of ‘the scientists’, and the black legend which assumes that they legitimised the long dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz. Having established what Spencer himself believed and wrote, it analyses the prolific writings of two of the leading ‘scientists’, Francisco Bulnes and Justo Sierra. It explains the eclectic nature of their discourses, derived from the works of not only Spencer but also Charles Darwin, Auguste Comte and other European writers, which reached Mexico in a fragmented fashion. It concludes that, far from forming a homogeneous elite clearly committed to to a conservative insistence, derived from Spencerian Positivism, on political stability and modernisation, ‘the scientists’ had an ambivalent relationship with Díaz."
10.4018/978-1-5225-8060-7.ch068,Philosophy of Information Technology,"Technology moves from the sex toy to the sex robot, a sex doll with artificial intelligence (AI) implemented. It is not a surprise idea to move robot as a servant to a sexual partner. As AI becomes more advanced and interaction between human and robot becomes more personal, sex and marriage with robot could result in the future. The authors conducted survey to discuss current and future trend of sex robot, its advantages and disadvantages. This paper also presents falsification theorems and implications to business, human social, moral, and psychological life caused by sex robot. This paper closes the discussion with further works of important ethical issues to be considered with deontology or consequentialism, and suggests to concern of sex robot regulations rather than banning it.

10.23943/princeton/9780691141671.001.0001,Philosophy of Law,"This book provides a comprehensive analysis of contemporary debates about the fundamental nature of law—an issue that has been at the heart of legal philosophy for centuries. What the law is seems to be a matter of fact, but this fact has normative significance: it tells people what they ought to do. The book argues that the myriad questions raised by the factual and normative features of law actually depend on the possibility of reduction—whether the legal domain can be explained in terms of something else, more foundational in nature. In addition to exploring the major issues in contemporary legal thought, the book provides a critical analysis of the people and ideas that have dominated the field in past centuries. It will be essential reading for anyone curious about the nature of law."
10.23943/princeton/9780691172279.001.0001,The Art of Philosophy,"Delving into the intersections between artistic images and philosophical knowledge in Europe from the late sixteenth to the early eighteenth centuries, this book shows that the making and study of visual art functioned as important methods of philosophical thinking and instruction. From frontispieces of books to monumental prints created by philosophers in collaboration with renowned artists, the book examines visual representations of philosophy and overturns prevailing assumptions about the limited function of the visual in European intellectual history. Rather than merely illustrating already existing philosophical concepts, visual images generated new knowledge for both Aristotelian thinkers and anti-Aristotelians, such as Descartes and Hobbes. Printmaking and drawing played a decisive role in discoveries that led to a move away from the authority of Aristotle in the seventeenth century. This book interprets visual art from printed books, student lecture notebooks, alba amicorum (friendship albums), broadsides, and paintings, and examines the work of such artists as Pietro Testa, Léonard Gaultier, Abraham Bosse, Dürer, and Rembrandt. In particular, it focuses on the rise and decline of the ‘plural image’, a genre that was popular among early modern philosophers. Plural images brought multiple images together on the same page, often in order to visualize systems of logic, metaphysics, natural philosophy, or moral philosophy. The book reveals the essential connections between visual commentary and philosophical thought."
10.15388/literatura.2018.2,Xenophon’s political philosophy: a project for the whole of Greece,"[full article, abstract in English; abstract in Lithuanian]&#x0D;
This paper discusses Xenophon’s political philosophy and its Greek context. One of the major themes running through Xenophon’s works is leadership, which he tackles implicitly or explicitly in virtually all of his writings (be it his philosophical, historical or literary writings). For Xenophon, the leader was important not only as an individual leading the armed forces, but as a leader of a city or a community as well. Bearing in mind the importance of leadership and the role of leaders for Xenophon, the author of this paper tries to show that Xenophon’s political philosophy can be seen as part of his Panhellenic program. The aim of this program is to politically unite the Greeks by making them enter into an alliance in the name of a common Panhellenic crusade against Persia."
10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-2-w9-109-2019,3D STRUCTURE ANALYSIS: ARCHITECTURE AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE TIES BETWEEN GEOMETRY AND PHILOSOPHY,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; In recent decades many Geomatics-based methods have been created to reconstruct and visualize objects, and these include digital photogrammetry, Lidar, remote sensing and hybrid techniques. The methods used to process such data are the result of research straddling the fields of Geomatics and Computer Vision, and employ techniques arising from approaches of analytical, geometric and statistical nature. One of the most fascinating fields of application concerns Architecture, which, moreover, has always depended on Mathematics generally and, more specifically, on Geometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Throughout history the link between Geometry and Architecture has been strong and while architects have used mathematics to construct their buildings, geometry has always been the essential tool allowing them to choose spatial shapes which are aesthetically appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Historically, mathematics and philosophy have been interrelated; many philosophers of the past were also mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The link between Philosophy and Architecture is twofold: on the one hand, philosophers have discussed what architecture is, on the other, philosophy has contributed to the development of architecture. We will deal with the ties between Architecture, Geometry and Philosophy over the centuries. Although there are artistic suggestions that go beyond time and space, and there are genial precursors, we can identify, in principle, some epochs: the ancient era, the modern era, and finally the contemporary epoch, from the crisis of positivistic sciences to globalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

10.22555/joeed.v5i1.2154,Phenomenology: A Philosophy and Method of Inquiry,"&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Phenomenology as a philosophy and a method of inquiry is not limited to an approach to knowing, it is rather an intellectual engagement in interpretations and meaning making that is used to understand the lived world of human beings at a conscious level. Historically, Husserl’ (1913/1962) perspective of phenomenology is a science of understanding human beings at a deeper level by gazing at the phenomenon. However, Heideggerian view of interpretive-hermeneutic phenomenology gives wider meaning to the lived experiences under study. Using this approach, a researcher uses bracketing as a taken for granted assumption in describing the natural way of appearance of phenomena to gain insights into lived experiences and interpret for meaning making. The data collection and analysis takes place side by side to illumine the specific experience to identify the phenomena that is perceived by the actors in a particular situation. The outcomes of a phenomenological study broadens the mind, improves the ways of thinking to see a phenomenon, and it enables to see ahead and define researchers’ posture through intentional study of lived experiences. However, the subjectivity and personal knowledge in perceiving and interpreting it from the research participant’s point of view has been central in phenomenological studies. To achieve such an objective, phenomenology could be used extensively in social sciences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
10.1017/s0031819100021057,Moral Philosophy as Applied Science,"(1) For much of this century, moral philosophy has been constrained by the supposed absolute gap between is andought, and the consequent belief that the facts of life cannot of themselves yield an ethical blueprint for future action. For this reason, ethics has sustained an eerie existence largely apart from science. Its most respected interpreters still believe that reasoning about right and wrong can be successful without a knowledge of the brain, the human organ where all the decisions about right and wrong are made. Ethical premises are typically treated in the manner of mathematical propositions: directives supposedly independent of human evolution, with a claim to ideal, eternal truth."

10.21273/hortsci.35.3.460c,391 C-factor Research on Horticultural Crops for Erosion Prediction: Philosophy and Methodology of Data Collection,"Even though research and education systems have transformed agriculture from a traditional to a high-technology sector, soil erosion still remains as a major universal problem to agricultural productivity. The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its replacement, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) are the most widely used of all soil erosion prediction models. Of the five factors in RUSLE, the cover and management (C) factor is the most important one from the standpoint of conservation planning because land use changes meant to reduce erosion are represented here. Even though the RUSLE is based on the USLE, this modern erosion prediction model is highly improved and updated. Alcorn State Univ. entered into a cooperative agreement with the NRCS of the USDA in 1988 to conduct C-factor research on vegetable and fruit crops. The main objective of this research is to collect plant growth and residue data that are used to populated databases needed to develop C-factors in RUSLE, and used in databases for other erosion prediction and natural resource models. The enormous data collected on leaf area index (LAI), canopy cover, lower and upper biomass, rate of residue decomposition, C:N ratio of samples of residues and destructive harvest and other gorwth parameters of canopy and rhizosphere made the project the largest data bank on horticultural crops. The philosophy and methodology of data collection will be presented."

                  The Oxford Handbook of the Philosophy of Love offers a wide array of original essays on the nature and value of love. The editors, Christopher Grau and Aaron Smuts, have assembled an esteemed group of thinkers, including both established scholars and younger voices. The volume contains three dozen essays addressing both issues about love as well as key philosophers who have contributed to the philosophy of love, such as Plato, Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, and Murdoch. The topics range from central issues about the nature and variety of love, the possibility of its rational justification, and whether it is an emotion, to the significance of love for law, economics, morality, and free will. The volume also contains an introduction to the subject as well as essays on love’s relation to jealousy, polyamory, religion, knowledge, and several other topics. This wide-ranging handbook will be a key resource for specialists working on the philosophy of love, and a helpful guide for those looking to learn more about the area.

In 2014, New Philosophy of the Masses was published, an updated and expanded version of Ai Siqi’s Philosophy of the Masses. In May 2016, Xi Jinping (2016) delivered his “Talk at the Forum Discussing the Work in Philosophy and Social Sciences,” a title which is reminiscent of Mao Zedong’s (1980) “Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art” of 1942. Drawing on the background of China’s 1950s academic philosophy, a comparison will be drawn to Xi Jinping’s effect on China’s academic landscape."

10.3329/pp.v51i1-2.17682,Modernity in Philosophy and Sociology: An Appraisal with Special Reference to Bangladesh,"The paper aims to explore the philosophical and sociological foundations of modernity as well as to figure out the pattern of modernity in Bangladesh. Modernity in philosophy refers to the fundamental modification of pre-modern political philosophy of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle by Machiavelli, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Bacon and Newton. Later, in this project, people who employed themselves as original contributors are Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Russell, Heidegger, Popper, Foucault, Derrida, and so on. Amongst these thinkers some were associated to develop the project of modernity based on the Western epistemological and ontological contemplates and some were appeared as the critic of this mundane venture. Modernity, however, in sociology refers to the move from feudal social order to the capitalistic social order under the grand project of industrialization, secularization and rationalization. Modernity, from its commencement, possesses two innate characteristics: one is epistemological or conjectural which is the actual motif of philosophy, and another one is ontological or applied which is congruence to the motif of sociology. Both philosophy and sociology take modernity as a vocation and shared the same epistemological and ontological standpoints. In the context of Bangladesh I tried to explain modernity under the framework of philosophy and sociology as well as conceptualized the pattern of modernity as ?copied because the type of modernity is found here as the simulation of Western and Eastern cultural and social values.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/pp.v51i1-2.17682"

10.3329/pp.v51i1-2.17681,The Linguistic Philosophy of Noam Chomsky,"Noam Chomsky, one of the most famous linguists of the twentieth century, based his linguistic works on certain philosophical doctrines. His main contribution to linguistics is Transformational Generative Grammar, which is founded on mentalist philosophy. He opposes the behaviourist psychology in favour of innatism for explaining the acquisition of language. He claims that it becomes possible for human child to learn a language for the linguistic faculty with which the child is born, and that the use of language for an adult is mostly a mental exercise. His ideas brought about a revolution in linguistics, dubbed as Chomskyan Revolution. According to him, the part of language which is innate to human being would be called Universal Grammar. His philosophy holds a strong propensity to rationalism in search of a cognitive foundation. His theory is a continuation of analytic philosophy, which puts language in the centre of philosophical investigation. He would also be identified as an essentialist. This paper considers various aspects of Chomskys linguistic philosophy with necessary elaborations.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/pp.v51i1-2.17681"

10.1093/oso/9780198779711.001.0001,The New Mechanical Philosophy,"This book argues for a new image of nature and of science—one that understands both natural and social phenomena to be the product of mechanisms, and that suggests that much of the work of natural and social scientists involves discovering, describing, and explaining how these mechanisms work. The book explores the interplay between ontological questions about mechanisms as things in the world and methodological questions about how these mechanisms can be characterized. Ontologically, mechanisms are understood to be collections of entities whose organized activities and interactions give rise to phenomena. This minimal conception of mechanism is abstract enough to encompass most of the wide variety of things that scientists have called mechanisms. While mechanisms are particular things, localized in space and time, the models that scientists use to describe them must be abstract and idealized. The mechanistic approach provides new ways of thinking about traditional metaphysical questions—for instance, about the nature of objects, part-whole and cause-effect relations, properties and universals, natural kinds, and laws of nature. It also suggests novel approaches for thinking about methodological questions concerning scientific representation, causal inference, reduction, and scientific explanation. The New Mechanical Philosophy offers the promise of a better understanding of the sources of both the unity and diversity of science."
10.21476/pp.2019.42231,"Life, Movement, and Thought:  Directions for Performance Philosophy and Practice as Research","This essay addresses the common goals of but also the practical differences between the emerging fields of Performance Philosophy (PP) and Practice as Research (PaR).  It does so by describing them both as interposing effective and affective action into the process of thinking and knowing, thereby resisting what Gilles Deleuze calls the Dogmatic Image of Thought.  The dogmatic image is described as a directional movement based on Plato’s allegory of the cave, where those who would learn turn away from phenomenal becoming and move upward and outward towards eternal Truth.  This movement travels from a static unknowing to a static knowledge.  Both PP and PaR resist such movement by employing techniques which forestall arriving at either stasis.  Through their developments, PP and PaR have come to concentrate on resisting one of these points of stasis or the other – with PP concentrating on avoiding static knowing, and PaR concentrating on finding the proper expression to avoid static unknowing, even while presenting its findings in forms that may appear ephemeral. "

10.18267/j.pep.147,Whose failure: market or philosophy?,"
The contemporary failings of governments can not be cured by mere institutional/constitutional political constraints. Without rational, objective morality to replace corrupt altruist-collectivist mentality, there will never be chance for freedom to prevail over all sorts of statism and to endure. Thus, I conclude that it was philosophy that had failed for centuries prior to Ayn Rand. "
10.1100/tsw.2003.104,Quality of Life Philosophy IV. The Brain and Consciousness,"In this article we look at the brain’s structure and function from a philosophical perspective. Although the brain at micro-level, with its trillions of ultra-thin nerve fibers, is one of the most complicated structures in the known universe, you can still grasp its composition if you go up to the level of the cell. How this structure functions is not quite clear. You can understand its function at fiber level, because it is fairly simple, and you can understand it at cell level, but it is already vague. Roughly speaking, you can envision a single nerve cell as a tiny, independent computer whose behavior is dependent on continuous calculations of all input. At organ level, the function can be understood as an extremely complex pattern machine. Finally, the brain’s function can be understood at the cognitive level as what provides consciousness through its ability to keep order in our complicated reality. The superior function of the brain is to connect the real us, our higher self, to the surrounding world.The brain has been developed so that it can create all possible complex patterns. The connectivity seems to imply that the patterns of the human brain are 1000-dimensional. It is our vision that these complicated patterns arise from basic patterns in the quantum matter of which everything is created. In our opinion, our consciousness’ special utilization of a patterned aspect of nature is what lies behind inscrutable statements like “Man is created in God’s image”. We suggest that these patterns in matter are the basic, creative force that influences all living organisms. Unfortunately, science has only just begun to understand these patterns.The Bible’s description of the origin of man is two people eating from the Tree of Knowledge and as punishment they are expelled from the Garden of Eden. What does that mean? It means that, as conscious creatures, we no longer were an unproblematic, harmonious part of the world around us. The great question is why this consciousness about the world, provided by the brain, is not a gift that makes life better instead of getting us expelled from the Garden of Eden. We think that our real problem is the fact that we are still not in control of our consciousness. Instead of it serving us, we have become its slaves. If we come to understand brain and consciousness in order to solve this basic problem of our existence, we shall again be able to become a coherent part of the world, both as individuals and as a species. We share the vision that such an understanding of the problems of consciousness will make medical science holistic and will bring quality of life, health, and the ability to function to its patients."
10.1100/tsw.2003.105,Quality of Life Philosophy V. Seizing the Meaning of Life and Becoming Well Again,"This paper presents a positive philosophy of life developed to support and inspire patients to take more responsibility for their own lives and to draw more efficiently on their known or hidden resources. The idea is that everybody can become wiser, use themselves better, and thus improve quality of life, subjective health, and the ability to function.To be responsible means to see yourself as the cause of your own existence and state of being. To be the one who forms your own life to your liking, so that others do not shape it in the way they prefer to see you. Seen this way, taking responsibility in practice is one of the most difficult things to do. One of the greatest and most difficult things to do in this context is to be able to love. To be the one who loves, instead of being the one who demands love, care, awareness, respect, and acceptance from somebody else.Since almost all of us have had parents who maybe loved us too little and mostly conditionally, we all harbor a deep yearning to be loved as we are, unconditionally. A lot of our energy is spent trying to find recognition and acceptance, more or less as we did as children from our parents, who created the framework and defined the rules of the game. But today, reality is different. We have grown up and now life is about shaping our own existence. So we must be the ones who love. This is what responsibility is all about. Taking responsibility is, quite literally, moving the barriers in our lives inside ourselves. Taking responsibility for life means that you are willing to see that the real barriers are not all these external ones, but something that can be found within yourself. Of course there is an outside world that cannot be easily shaped according to your dreams. But a responsible point of view is that although it is difficult, the problem is not impossible; it is your real challenge and task. If there is something you really want, you can achieve it, but whether it happens depends on your wholehearted, goal-oriented, and continuous attempts. This paper describes the philosophy about seizing the meaning of life and becoming well again, even when there is little time left."
10.1100/tsw.2003.102,"Quality of Life Philosophy I. Quality of Life, Happiness, and Meaning in Life","In the Danish Quality of Life Survey, we asked 10,000 people about their quality of life with the validated SEQOL questionnaire with more than 300 questions on their quality of life. How did they feel? How content were they with their lives? How happy were they? Did they feel their needs were fulfilled? And many more questions. We asked the questions we believed to be important for their quality of life (QOL). The results were quite surprising and forced us to recontemplate the following philosophical questions: What is quality of life, happiness, and meaning in life? What is a human being? Do we need a new biology? Is the brain the seat of consciousness? How do we seize the meaning of life and by doing so, will we become well again? What are the key concepts of quality of life? The meaning of life is connectedness and development. It is about realizing every opportunity and potential in one’s existence. The opportunities must be found and acknowledged. What do you find when you find yourself deep down? You find your real self and your purpose in life. You realize that you are already a part of a larger totality. Antonovsky called it “coherence”. Maslow called it “transcendence”. Frankl called it “meaning of life”. We call it simply “being”.To test if these philosophical questions are actually relevant for medicine, we looked at the consequences for patients being taught the quality of life philosophy. Quite surprisingly we learned from our pilot studies with “quality of life as medicine” that just by assimilating the basic concepts of the quality of life philosophy presented in this series of papers, patients felt better and saw their lives as more meaningful. The improvement of the patient’s personal philosophy of life seems to be the essence of holistic medicine, helping the patient to assume more responsibility for his or her own existence."
10.1100/tsw.2003.106,Quality of Life Philosophy VI. The Concepts,"The about a hundred central concepts related to research in the global quality of life can, in a holistic medical frame of interpretation, be organized under ten abstract key concepts: existence, creation of the world, state of being, daily living, talents, relations, sex, health, personal development, and therapy with subthemes as discussed in this paper. The paper shows that the concepts in each group can be seen as related to each other in a quite intuitive and logical way, to give a coherent quality of life philosophy that allows the physician to encourage, inspire, and support his patient. In every consultation, one new concept and idea of existence can be taught to the patient, helping him or her to realize the meaning of life, the source of joy, and the reason for the actual suffering. In this way, we help the patient to mobilize hidden and known resources and to improve quality of life, subjective health, and the ability to function. The concepts were harvested in 2003 at a Nordic seminar on quality of life research, held in Sweden. Life does not only cohere on the inside, but also on the outside. The same power that ties together all the cells in our body, seems to tie us together in relationships and new wholeness. This power evolves into new kinds of relations that unite on more and more complex levels, with the global ecosystem as the highest known level.Our intentions come from this coherent matrix of life. In the beginning of our life, the web of life itself gave birth to our fundamental purpose of life. The abstract purpose determines the frame of interpretation of reality: How we will perceive ourselves throughout life, our inner life, and the world around us. The frame of interpretation is pitched in language and concepts, in fact it creates our perceptions. Based on these perceptions and our purposes of life, our behavior arises. Our consciousness evolves through the witnessing of our behavior and through the response caused by it. Through the slowly acquired mastering of our surrounding world, we obtain our power, which gives us success in life, when we use it responsibly and unite it in harmony with our deepest purpose of life. When many people experience not having success, it is because they are not conscious about their original purpose or the deepest meaning of their lives. They do not know themselves. They do not experience the world in that way and do not realize that they themselves are the cause. Therefore responsibility and self-knowledge, which add up to wisdom, are the ways to a good and successful life."
10.1100/tsw.2003.110,Quality of Life Philosophy II: What is a Human Being?,"The human being is a complex matter and many believe that just trying to understand life and what it means to be human is a futile undertaking. We believe that we have to try to understand life and get a grip on the many faces of life, because it can be of great value to us to learn to recognize the fundamental principles of how life is lived to the fullest. Learning to recognize the good and evil forces of life helps us to make use of the good ones.To be human is to balance between hundreds of extremes. Sometimes we have to avoid these extremes, but at other times it seems we should pursue them, to better understand life. With our roots in medicine, we believe in the importance of love for better health. The secret of the heart is when reason and feelings meet and we become whole. Where reason is balanced perfectly by feelings and where mind and body come together in perfect unity, a whole new quality emerges, a quality that is neither feeling nor reason, but something deeper and more complete.In this paper, we outline only enough biology to clarify what the fundamental inner conflicts are about. The insight into these conflicts gives us the key to a great deal of the problems of life. To imagine pleasures greater than sensual pleasures seems impossible to most people. What could such a joy possibly be? But somewhere deep in life exists the finest sweetness, the greatest quality in life, the pure joy of being alive that emerges when we are fully present and life is in balance. This deep joy of life is what we call experiencing the meaning of life."
10.1100/tsw.2003.76,Measurement of Quality of Life II. From the Philosophy of Life to Science,"We believe it should be possible to make operational the philosophical ideas of the good life in order to make it the object of scientific research. The Quality of Life Research Center in Copenhagen, Denmark has therefore spent the last several years with these questions and tried to find practical and evidence-based scientific solutions.This paper describes the theoretical road taken in moving from the abstract philosophy of life to the actual questionnaire. It presents an important aspect of our work with the quality-of-life (QOL) concept though the last decade. We have developed the quality-of-life philosophy; the SEQOL, QOL5, and QOL1 questionnaires; the quality-of-life theory; and the quality-of-life research methodology. We carried out quality-of-life population surveys and developed techniques for improving quality of life with the chronically sick patient. This paper presents the struggle to create a rating scale for the generic measurement of the global quality of life, based on quality-of-life theory, derived from quality-of-life philosophy. The developed rating scale is a ratio scale combining a Likert scale, a visual analogue scale, and a numerical scale, to a reduced combination scale. This allows for the extraction of as much information from the respondents as possible without exhausting them unduly or demanding more than can be reasonably expected."
10.1100/tsw.2003.103,"Quality of Life Philosophy III. Towards a New Biology: Understanding the Biological Connection between Quality of Life, Disease, and Healing","This paper addresses (in a philosophical way) the complex and enigmatic interface between matter, life, and consciousness in modern medical science. The problem today in understanding living matter is not at the molecular level, but at the macro level where all molecular activities in the individual cell are coordinated, and especially at a higher level, where the activities of all the organism’s cells are coordinated. Although we understand very much of the body’s chemistry, we have only just started to get the gist of the tremendous organization of living matter. We are just beginning to acknowledge the enormous flow of information that is needed to make everything function in a healthy organism, including consciousness, where every cell does exactly what it has to do to make the organs function.A concept that seems to be able to bridge the scientifically very different domains of matter, life, and consciousness seems to be “biological information”. If a cell is seen as a liquid crystal in which the cell’s molecules constantly connect in firm mutual relationships only to dissolve again and become fluid and free, whenever the cell needs it, the backbone of the cell seems to be the information that organizes the cell. For example, in cell motion a cell is able to crawl with the help of a skeleton of fibers that can be created guided by biological information, whenever the cell needs the solidity provided by the fibers. The moment it has finished crawling or intends to crawl in another direction, these fibers will dissolve again. The fibers are made of millions of molecules that connect in an arranged pattern, and they dissolve when these molecules again let go of each other. How the cell precisely regulates such processes is today a complete mystery. How cells cocreate consciousness is also an enigma. All we can do is describe the cell and the organisms arising from its cells as filled with energy and information as well as an unbeatable ability to organize itself way down to the molecular level, where apparently the cell is in control of almost every single molecule.Our understanding today of how the information is stored and how it flows through living matter is still very limited. The source of the qualities (the qualia) characterizing the human being as a whole — like joy, love, motivation, consciousness, free will, wisdom, intuitive competence — is still practically unknown and scientifically unexplained, more than 50 years after science has turned itself towards these fundamental problems. We believe that we need a radically new biology and medicine to give the scientific explanations of the structure, dynamics, and quality of life, and of its consciousness."
10.1075/lplp.31.1.02des,Language policy and political philosophy: On the emerging linguistic justice debate,"This paper provides an overview of the emerging debates over language policy and linguistic diversity within political philosophy. It outlines the larger context of this debate and identifies its protagonists and the main issues at stake in it. In addition, it presents an interpretive scheme for the analysis of the variety of approaches that have so far been developed within this field. This scheme relates these approaches back to two clashes of different language ideologies. The first clash is between instrumentalism and constitutivism. The second clash is between transparency and hybridity. Finally, the paper explains why the sociolinguistic literature on language policy should interest political philosophers, and vice versa: why sociolinguists should engage with political philosophy."
10.28925/2226-3012.2017.6.2025,Problems of interaction between philosophy and methodology of scientific knowledge in pedagogy,"The article presents the excursion of formation and phased development the methodology of scientific knowledge as a science, in close cooperation with the scientific philosophy: its status, functions, similarities and differences in their methodological significance.

It is rivaled the influence of philosophy, logic, science and scientific knowledge on the further development of the methodology as a science. Stages and the concept of its formation and development are regarded and comparative analysis of the object, method, structure and function of philosophy and methodology of science light up their role as a factor of mutual interpenetration. Discussions on these issues are going on till nowdays for benefit of these sciences and their application in the implementation of the theoretical, empirical and applied research.

The findings of the research show that any science should evolve under some general laws at the empirical and theoretical levels of research. Thus, the main task of Methodology of Scientific Knowledge, a science, is the study of general methods of cognition, ways and means of formation and development of new scientific knowledge (both empirical and theoretical), general laws of the development. Therefore, the study of general methods of cognition, ways and means of the formation and development of new scientific knowledge (both empirical and theoretical), general laws of the development of nature and society is the main task of two sciences - methodology of scientific knowledge and philosophy, while reproducing extra knowledge that is required for research in certainfields of science."
10.28925/2226-3012.2017.6.7075,The visual meaning of intellectual contemplation in the philosophy of J. G. Fichte,"The article examines the visual perspective of the J. G. Fichte’s philosophy of transcendental idealism. He paid most attention to visual paradigm compared to other representatives of the German classical philosophy. The author notes that J. G. Fichte developed the original concept of a transcendental-phenomenological vision, in which the subject does not contemplate actually existing objects, but their reflection in subject’s consciousness. He does not see things, but the result of his own process of vision, the effects of his acts of contemplation. Because what is seeing, and the subject of the vision are identical, the contemplation of an object by a subject can give rise to adequate images of reality. Self- consciousness of the subject doesn’t dependent on reality,it is a pure activity that lays itself, and laying is simultaneously contemplation of itself. This contemplation, as is shown in the article, is the intellectual contemplation that forms the basis of every knowledge, and is also the main point of view for each philosophy. Intelligent contemplation as a reflection of one's consciousness combines creation and knowledge of oneself. Reliability of the results of intellectual contemplation is based on the authenticity of self-consciousness. The law of the development of the spirit is the self-limitation of the process of self-consciousness, which became the basis for the formation of the idea of historicism, which is a prerequisite for overcoming dogmatism and creating a new vision of the world."
10.1515/pcssr-2015-0018,A Hermeneutical Analysis of the InternalistApproachin the Philosophy of Sport,"Abstract
				In this paper, we make a hermeneutical analysis of internalism, the dominant tradition in the philosophy of sports. In order to accomplish this, we identify the prejudices that guide the internalist view of sports, namely the Platonic-Analytic prejudice introduced by Suits, one of the forefathers of internalism. Then, we critically analyze four consequences of following such a prejudice: a) its reductive nature, b) the production of a unrealistic view of sports, c) the vagueness of the idea of excellence; and d) the leap from the descriptive analysis of the sporting phenomenon to the setting of normative requirements for the practice of sports."
10.1093/med/9780198758853.003.0010,"Epilogue: Psychiatry, neuroscience, philosophy","This Epilogue summarizes the main points of the book's eight chapters. It emphasizes a biopsychosocial model for understanding, treating and possibly psychiatric disorders. It also points out that major forms of mental illness are disorders of this brain as well as disorders of the mind and the person relations to others and the world. Advances in neuroscience may lead to better explanations of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and their philosophical implications. But these advances may not completely account for the experience of living with these disorders. Given the global burden of disease from mental illness, it should receive priority in medical research over other types of disease to improve the quality of life of the people affected by it."
10.23925/2316-5278.2018v19i2p282-295,Basic human needs as values: exploring John Dewey’s normative perspective on social philosophy,"O projeto de John Dewey sobre a filosofia social não tem sido considerado como uma peça importante de seu pensamento. Entretanto, seus textos sobre esse tópico constituem um notável esforço para articular diversos novos conceitos e ideias, os quais não podem ser encontrados em outra parte de sua extensa obra filosófica. Inserida nesse contexto, a nova edição de suas “Palestras em filosofia política e social” – série de palestras que Dewey apresentou quando esteve na China – fornece um material único para revisar seu ponto de vista social. Levando-se em consideração que o pragmatista introduz uma “figura normativa” e que ele identifica um conjunto de necessidades humanas básicas de maneira a compreender plenamente esse critério normativo. Como hipótese, considero (i) que a filosofia social está principalmente associada com juízos práticos e (ii) que é plausível interpretar essas necessidades humanas básicas como valores. Para sustentar essas afirmações, primeiro, reconstruo a proposta de Dewey sobre um terceiro tipo de pensamento social. Segundo, examino sua posição sobre valores e normas. Terceiro, analiso a “figura normativa” e considero a “leitura antropológica” apresentada por Roberto Frega (2015). Por fim, ofereço uma análise complementar, argumentando que é possível explicar o padrão normativo de Dewey de maneira coerente com respeito aos propósitos do seu pensamento social – e, além disso, que é possível evitar qualquer compromisso essencialista."
10.4018/jkss.2010010104,Towards The New Episteme,"The usual horizon of knowledge science is limited to nominalism, empiricism, and naturalistic and evolutionary epistemologies. I propose to broaden this horizon by applying some other philosophical attitudes, such as a non-nominalistic philosophy of language. A basic methodology for the new episteme, including (nonnominalistic) typology and a definition of knowledge and of tacit knowledge, is proposed. Several types of knowledge and the corresponding tacit knowledge are discussed within a broadened philosophical context. There are many types of knowledge and tacit knowledge using different methods of sharing. The main problem with the effective sharing of tacit knowledge is sharing knowledge relevant to the given problem. The transfer, change and transformation of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge are possible. An example of such a transition, which I call conceptualization, is described. Conceptualization exemplifies how new knowledge can be created with the use of tacit knowledge. A need also exists for a professional collaboration between knowledge science, knowledge management and philosophy."
10.1017/s0266267115000462,MENTALISM VERSUS BEHAVIOURISM IN ECONOMICS: A PHILOSOPHY-OF-SCIENCE PERSPECTIVE,"Abstract:Behaviourism is the view that preferences, beliefs and other mental states in social-scientific theories are nothing but constructs re-describing people’s behaviour. Mentalism is the view that they capture real phenomena, on a par with the unobservables in science, such as electrons and electromagnetic fields. While behaviourism has gone out of fashion in psychology, it remains influential in economics, especially in ‘revealed preference’ theory. We defend mentalism in economics, construed as a positive science, and show that it fits best scientific practice. We distinguish mentalism from, and reject, the radical neuroeconomic view that behaviour should be explained in terms of brain processes, as distinct from mental states."
10.1017/s0266267118000500,What is the economic concept of choice? An experimental philosophy study,"AbstractEconomists and philosophers disagree about the concept of choice used in economics. Some behavioural economists argue that economic models of choice will improve as they become more and more psychologically realistic. Don Ross argues that this argument fails because its hidden assumption – that the economic concept of choice is the same as the psychological counterpart – is false. Ross conjectures that the economic concept of choice concerns a population-scale pattern of behavioural changes in response to incentives. We conduct a survey experiment to test two predictions that Ross’s conjecture generates. The statistical analysis of our data confirms our predictions, although with some qualifications. In interpreting our results, we distinguish two versions of commonsensible realism, strong and weak, and propose the weak one as a plausible explanation of our results. Weak commonsensible realism also produces further testable hypotheses. Some methodological implications of our study are discussed."
10.1017/s0031819100032666,Physics and Philosophy,"I think it will be agreed that there is a domain of investigation where physics and philosophy overlap. There are branches of philosophy which do not approach the subject-matter of physics, and a great part of the work of practical and theoretical physicists is not aimed at extending our knowledge of the fundamental nature of things; but questions which concern the general interpretation of the physical universe and the significance of physical law are claimed by both parties. I suppose that ideally the physicist should be allowed to elucidate his own universe up to a point, and then hand it over to the philosopher to ascertain its exact status in relation to a wider outlook."
10.4018/ijsesd.2015100105,Philosophy of Information Technology,"Technology moves from the sex toy to the sex robot, a sex doll with artificial intelligence (AI) implemented. It is not a surprise idea to move robot as a servant to a sexual partner. As AI becomes more advanced and interaction between human and robot becomes more personal, sex and marriage with robot could result in the future. The authors conducted survey to discuss current and future trend of sex robot, its advantages and disadvantages. This paper also presents falsification theorems and implications to business, human social, moral, and psychological life caused by sex robot. This paper closes the discussion with further works of important ethical issues to be considered with deontology or consequentialism, and suggests to concern of sex robot regulations rather than banning it."
10.21476/pp.2015.1129,From Odd Encounters to a Prospective Confluence: Dance-Philosophy,"This text inquires into the relationship between Western philosophy and Western theatre dance from their odd encounters in modernity to the current affiliations between contemporary choreographic poetics, critical theory and contemporary philosophical thought. The point of departure for the inquiry is a discussion of the three problems that have structured the historically vexed relationship between dance and philosophy: dance’s belated acquisition of the status of an art discipline, the special ontological status of the work of dance, and the limits of dance’s meaning-production set by the theme of bodily movement’s “ephemerality” and “disappearance.” After critically examining the approaches of Alain Badiou and Jacques Rancière in whose philosophies dance is relegated to a metaphor or, even worse, to an ahistorical conduit for a general ontology, the author makes a case for another movement of thought that arises in dance practice and is at the same time philosophical, rooted in Spinoza’s (and Deleuze’s) principle of expression. Demonstrating how choreographers, like Xavier Le Roy and Jonathan Burrows, create by “posing problems,” Cvejić presents a theory of “expressive concepts,” whereby choreography contributes to a philosophical rethinking of the relationship between the body, movement and time. This points to the new prospects of a kind of “dance-philosophy,” in which the epistemic hierarchy is reversed: the stake is no longer in what philosophy could do for dance, but how an experimental, radically pragmatic orientation in dance offers a practical framework for theorizing perception, concept-formation and other philosophical issues."
10.21476/pp.2017.22131,Philosophy as Verse-Performance: five poems and a formalist prospectus,"This article consists of five poems and an introductory essay. The poems are intended on the one hand to make a case for the currently underrated virtues of poetic formalism, i.e., for the revival of rhyme and meter as aspects of poetic practice. On the other they argue for a distinctly philosophical mode of poetry that embraces the values of conceptual or rational discourse as against a romantic-modernist conception premised on the intrinsic superiority of lyric, metaphor, symbol, analogy, and suchlike touchstone values. These issues are laid out programmatically in the opening essay and developed in a more performative as well as formal way in the five poems. "
10.21476/pp.2015.1112,The Contemporary Quarrel Between Performance and Literature? Reflections on Performance (and) Philosophy,"This article argues for an understanding of performance as being motivated by a principle of autotelicity that suspends all considerations other than those of the performance itself as it unfolds in creative free play. It is argued that it is this ‘principle of performance’ that underpinned Plato’s rejection of poetry in favour of philosophy, in a foundational, mutually definitional rupture that he characterises as stemming from an ancient quarrel. This principle of performance survived both in and beyond philosophical discourse. It can, as this paper argues, be understood as being at work in the idealised conception of ‘literature’ that developed during the ‘theory’ explosion of the 1960s and 70s, as in institution that is, at least potentially, capable of saying anything. This article asks whether Performance Philosophy risks either undermining the principle of performance by making it subservient to the project of philosophy (and thereby reiterating Plato’s foundational move), or whether it hopes to put that principle to work philosophically in a way that does not limit it (and thereby reinscribe the recent but apparently exhausted ideals of the theory explosion, substituting ‘literature’ with ‘performance’). Either way, it is claimed, there may be important genealogical work for Performance Philosophy to do."
10.21476/pp.2015.117,For What Do We Need Performance Philosophy?,"In my short manifesto I consider the interrelation of the emergence of performance philosophy and the simultaneous emergence of practice-based or artistic research in the humanities and the higher education in arts. The need for performing artists to have recourse to philosophical discourse is motivated by an attempt to establish their new political and academic role as artist-researchers, as well as to understand the nature and the significance of the knowledge they produce. Performance philosophy opens up a new academic practice in which performance, performance makers and performers can make contact with philosophical thinking without the advocacy of intermediary disciplines and in equal dialogue with them, learn to think in their own terms, and become understood by others. It builds upon a collective attempt to give an answer to what performing arts and artists can do in an age where ‘performance’ has become a denominator of global capitalism."
10.21476/pp.2019.42239,Failing to Think: The Promise of Performance Philosophy,"Performance Philosophy, at its most hopefully imagined, seems to promise to succeed where other philosophical discourses and performative practises have come up short—perhaps even failed. That is to say, far from simply announcing a relatively modest interdisciplinary venture between philosophy and performance, Performance Philosophy seems invested with a radical potential that would, if realised, reveal a paradigm of creation and/or interpretation that is quite new and distinct. Its achievements, if successful, would be beyond the compass of performance and philosophy conceived independently of each other. Even the term itself, ‘Performance Philosophy’, conveys a certain paratactical momentum that seems directed towards a profound artistic, intellectual, and disciplinary miscegenation where neither performance nor philosophy would remain separate and intact and neither would be subordinated to or conditioned by the unchanged disciplinary genealogy and underpinnings of the other. Though exciting in prospect, this is far from unproblematic. Is performance, as an act of deliberate creative expression, not to some degree pulling in the opposite direction to truth-revealing, knowledge-bearing philosophy? Or does Performance Philosophy relate only to more elastic understandings and redefinitions of philosophy? More specifically, this article asks what ‘thinking’ ‘itself’ might be in the context of Performance Philosophy and what sort of ‘knowledge’ it might give rise to. It will be argued that against the usual measures of epistemological success Performance Philosophy must be judged to fail. However it will then explores whether, in a move reminiscent of the aesthetics of failure of early German Romanticism, it is precisely failure that seems to hold the promise of opening up new epistemological ground. "

10.1093/oso/9780198790396.001.0001,Philosophy and Model Theory,"Model theory is used in every theoretical branch of analytic philosophy: in philosophy of mathematics, in philosophy of science, in philosophy of language, in philosophical logic, and in metaphysics. But these wide-ranging appeals to model theory have created a highly fragmented literature. On the one hand, many philosophically significant results are found only in mathematics textbooks: these are aimed squarely at mathematicians; they typically presuppose that the reader has a serious background in mathematics; and little clue is given as to their philosophical significance. On the other hand, the philosophical applications of these results are scattered across disconnected pockets of papers. The first aim of this book, then, is to consider the philosophical uses of model theory, focusing on the central topics of reference, realism, and doxology. Its second aim is to address important questions in the philosophy of model theory, such as: sameness of theories and structure, the boundaries of logic, and the classification of mathematical structures. Philosophy and Model Theory will be accessible to anyone who has completed an introductory logic course. It does not assume that readers have encountered model theory before, but starts right at the beginning, discussing philosophical issues that arise even with conceptually basic model theory. Moreover, the book is largely self-contained: model-theoretic notions are defined as and when they are needed for the philosophical discussion, and many of the most philosophically significant results are given accessible proofs."

10.21511/ee.07(4).2016.03,Cosmovision and African conservation philosophy: indigenous knowledge system perspective,"Cosmovision is the worldview of a society that is deeply imbedded in the way in which that society is organized and evolves over time. It is a society’s attempt to explain and better understand all that surrounds it, including its place within the cosmos, or universe and how it conserves it environment. In Africa, like elsewhere, indigenous knowledge systems (IKSs) were used to administer peace, harmony, and order amongst the people and their physical environment. However, with the advent of colonialism in Africa, IKSs were not only marginalized, but demonized leaving their potentials for establishing and maintaining a moral, virtuous society, unexploited. It is in this light that this article argues for a correction to the vestiges of colonialism. The article adopts examples of IKS success stories in pre-colonial era showing the beauty of the undiluted African indigenous knowledge systems and their potential for establishing a moral, virtuous society. To this end, the article argues that Africa, today, is in the grips of high crime rates, serious moral decadence, and other calamities because of the marginalization, false, and pejorative label attached to the African IKSs. This article criticizes, pulls down, and challenges the inherited colonial legacies, which have morally and socially injured many African societies.

Research on this topic focuses on the cooperation of two authors who have published papers together. However, this paper is exploring the latent association of two authors. By ‘latent association’, we mean that the collaboration between two researchers has not yet occurred but might very likely take place in the future. In this paper, we will aim to find out a couple of authors who have never published together and who bear similar academic interests or study similar subjects. We will also show how the concepts of Yuan (Interdependent arising), Kong (Emptiness), Shi (Energy) and Guanxi (Relationship) in Chinese philosophy contribute to understand ‘latent associations’. These four Chinese concepts are the theoretical basis of this paper. By explaining one by one what each concept is about we hope to tackle the two following questions: What do those four concepts exactly tell us? And how are they linked together? Finally, we will look at the empirical case study in scientometrics. We hope to show that this application of Chinese concepts can unravel latent associations between researchers in Database."

Then we offer an account of the events that led to the formation of what is now the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations (FAPSA), the development and production of a diverse range of curriculum and supporting materials for philosophy in schools, the making of the Australasian journal, and more recent events. Our purpose is to create further interest in exploring this complex and rich history. This will achieve a better understanding of the possible future directions for classroom practice and research.[1]     An earlier draft of this paper was presented at the 45th Annual Conference of the Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia (see Burgh &amp; Thornton 2016)."
10.4018/978-1-59140-714-0.ch002,The Philosophy of Technology,"We start by outlining some of the problems concerning technology and society that have led people to reflect upon it. One of the most poignant questions is that of “technological determinism” and the extent to which technology is “under control” vs. the extent to which it controls society. The speed of change, the assumption that technology is beneficial, the uptake and geographical spread of technology across cultures, and the extent to which technology creates a never-ending cycle of increased complexity are just some of the “issues” that require examination in the question of technology’s impact upon society."
10.4018/978-1-59140-714-0.ch010,The Philosophy of AI,"As we shall see, the “theology of technology” can help inform the philosophical underpinnings of AI. We start with elucidating the idea of computation, and describe the idea of Turing machine computation. Its equivalence with Post systems and the lambda calculus are explained, and the way that these systems may be regarded as “rule based” and “generative” are brought out. All the equivalent formal models define enumerable languages. However, as Turing’s original definition demonstrated, there are definable numbers that are not computable, that is, a computer could not be used to write some numbers down, yet they exist. The presence of “unsolvable” computational problems also reveals the limitations of Turing machines, and suggests the current limits of computation. While the “intuitive” understanding of computation is one of “step-by-step” algorithmic procedure, it will be hard to conceive of any other computational model."

Numerous elements were involved in the seventy years it took to establish its foundation: starting in England and the USA; andragogy and human resource development [HRD]; andragogy and self-directed learning [SDL]; conflict between supporters and detractors; comparing European and USA perspectives; trust in learners’ abilities; scientific foundation of andragogy; skepticism and its counter-balance; and, antecedents of andragogy. Trends in usage and considering its possible benefits set the tone for the future of andragogy from 2000 forward."

As outlined at ECAP08, both domains of reality can be characterized by the different logics applicable to them. A new “Logic in Reality” (LIR) was proposed as best describing the dynamics of real, non-computable processes. The LIR process view of the real macroscopic world is compared here with recent computational and information-theoretic models. Proposals that the universe can be described as a mathematical structure equivalent to a computer or by simple cellular automata are deflated. A new interpretation of quantum superposition as supporting a concept of paraconsistent parallelism in quantum computing and an appropriate ontological commitment for computational modeling are discussed."

Thus it is fundamental to distinguish the interventions for the global behavior improvement from those related to local reinforcements. In this chapter is then proposed a scheme of interventions hierarchy and, therefore, a related design process road-map together with the explanation of a correct design philosophy for the static and seismic retrofitting of historical masonry buildings. Moreover it is also reported an example of two distinguished levels of intervention, with numerical analyses supporting that solution. "

10.2178/bsl.1804010,The philosophy of logic ,"Abstract
            This talk surveys a range of positions on the fundamental metaphysical and epistemological questions about elementary logic, for example, as a starting point: what is the subject matter of logic—what makes its truths true? how do we come to know the truths of logic? A taxonomy is approached by beginning from well-known schools of thought in the philosophy of mathematics—Logicism, Intuitionism, Formalism, Realism—and sketching roughly corresponding views in the philosophy of logic. Kant, Mill, Frege, Wittgenstein, Carnap, Ayer, Quine, and Putnam are among the philosophers considered along the way."
10.4018/978-1-5225-0267-8.ch008,Morfosis Educational Philosophy,"Early in the 21st Century it became obvious that the world has developed in multiple and complex directions which resulted in the pressing demand of a different type of citizen. Many of the previously well-established principles and values are under examination, and oftentimes are explicitly challenged. Any K-12 academic institution that holds as a central belief that knowledge is individually and socially constructed by learners who are active observers of the world, active questioners, agile problem posers and critical and creative problem solvers, must design, implement and promote an educational philosophy that mirrors the needs described above. This chapter discusses a new educational philosophy (Morfosis) that has been adopted by ACS Athens over the past decade. Morfosis is defined within the 21st Century framework, as a holistic, meaningful, and harmonious educational experience, guided by ethos. The chapter also advances the concept of successful vs. significant institutions, and shares recommendations on how to establish a culture that promotes and establishes the latter. "

Sufficiency economy philosophy and government support are seen as important covariates that could foster sustainable performance of SMEs. A sample of 119 SME entrepreneurs in the South of Thailand participated in this study. Exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical multiple regression were conducted and the results demonstrated that some dimensions of sufficiency economy philosophy and government support are critical predictors of economic and social performance. Moreover, knowledge and morality are found to promote the principle of sufficiency economy philosophy, as such SME entrepreneurs should be cognizant of the potential effects of this philosophy. The appropriate practices can be equipped and nurtured through the values of sufficiency economy philosophy, which shed light on means to achieve firm sustainability. "

Increasing age results in physical and psychological changes. Life at this age can be challenging, especially from an economic standpoint. Economic protection refers to a sense of safety and protection derived from a solid income or other resources to support present and future needs. People need food, clothing, shelter, and good health to survive. In Islam, this is a basic requirement for human life. Inadequate economic protections contribute to increased poverty and affect the quality of life, contrary to the philosophy of the objectives of Islamic law, which seek to preserve its five major interests: religion, life, property, lineage, and intellect. As a holistic religion, Islam does not ignore economic protection and its role in preserving human life, including for the elderly. This chapter discusses forms of economic protection for the elderly that ensure achievement of the objectives of Islamic law. "

Namely, it is a practical – rather than theoretical – philosophy; indeed, a practice in itself, rather than an analytical pursuit, which is aimed at achieving practical wisdom, rather than theoretical insights. This entails different kinds of practices – from what we would nowadays call moral and political philosophy, in Plato and Aristotle, through a certain kind of interpretive practice, in Heidegger and Gadamer, to a series of neo-pragmatist ways of living, in Rorty and Shusterman. What these have in common is a philosophical focus on what we can do, in our personal, social, and professional lives, rather than what type of theoretical knowledge we can achieve – and how. The former is a kind of philosophy that is more likely to have an impact on the way we live, than on a particular theory or line of arguments. "
10.1093/oso/9780198807520.001.0001,Philosophy Within Its Proper Bounds,"In Philosophy Within Its Proper Bounds, Edouard Machery argues that resolving many traditional and contemporary philosophical issues is beyond our epistemic reach and that philosophy should reorient itself toward more humble, but ultimately more important intellectual endeavors. Attempts to resolve such issues are modally immodest: Any resolution would require an epistemic access to metaphysical possibilities and necessities, which, Edouard Machery argues, we do not have. In effect, then, Philosophy Within Its Proper Bounds defends a form of modal skepticism. The book assesses the main philosophical method for acquiring the modal knowledge that the resolution of modally immodest philosophical issues turns on: the method of cases, that is, the consideration of actual or hypothetical situations (which cases or thought experiments describe) in order to determine what facts hold in these situations. Canvassing the extensive work done by experimental philosophers over the last fifteen years, Edouard Machery shows that the method of cases is unreliable and should be rejected. Importantly, the dismissal of modally immodest philosophical issues is no cause for despair: Many important philosophical issues remain within our epistemic reach. In particular, reorienting the course of philosophy would free time and resources for bringing back to prominence a once-central intellectual endeavor: conceptual analysis."

Attempting to resuscitate the long tradition of philosophical hedonism and materialism in Western civilization, Onfray proposes a different, sensual way of being in the world that he persuasively contends is paramount to the continued existence of the human race.  As the philosopher himself candidly admits, Cosmos is a practical guide that could be used as a starting point for changing the way we think and live in the Anthropocene epoch."

The p4c Hawai'i pedagogy offers an approach to further philosophical thinking in schools while reconceptualizing what “philosophizing” entails. This chapter then presents the key elements of p4c Hawai'i pedagogy as a proven way to help develop teachers and classrooms that cultivate philosophical thinking. These elements are presented not only for K-12 classrooms but in the context of redesigning teacher education programs. This chapter is not presenting a program or curriculum but instead highlights key areas of change. Colleges of education must restructure their approach to current teacher preparation programs in order to instill, model, and foster the type of teaching that we wish to produce in our educators. "
10.1017/cjlj.2019.6,Philosophy and Constitutional Theory: The Cautionary Tale of Jeremy Waldron and the Philosopher’s Stone,"This article considers the relationship between moral philosophy and constitutional theory through a detailed examination of the work of Jeremy Waldron—an unavoidable voice in contemporary constitutionalist debate. Through a rigorous, original and holistic deconstruction of his work and its philosophical implications, I argue that Waldron’s engagement with core philosophy within his constitutional scholarship is wholly problematic, containing a number of ambiguities and apparent inconsistencies. These issues, I suggest, may stem from an at times rather casual treatment of the realist/anti-realist issue of core philosophy, perhaps owing something to his view that it is in fact safely irrelevant to his constitutional pursuits. In any case, this view, I argue, is misguided, and the problems which result are real: they not only create issues of theoretical consistency and clarity; they put Waldron’s constitutional theory in danger. Like all good tales, I suggest there are lessons to be learned from this: one must think, and think carefully, about the philosophical background of one’s work, and take care in setting this out in a clear, thorough and coherent way—the stakes are too high not to. With this in mind, this article also lays some groundwork for a path into constitutional theory firmly grounded in my own anti-realist moral scepticism."
10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.572,A Fanonian Philosophy of Race,"Frantz Fanon was one of the most important voices in decolonial and black liberation struggles of the mid-20th century. Writing about race and colonialism in Martinique, France, and Algeria, he articulated the importance of blackness to Western frameworks of the human. The black studies scholarship influenced by Fanon has continued in a similar vein, arguing that much of modern, Western thought either does not discuss race at all or considers race as an add-on to the larger discussion of Western subjectivity. Alternatively, Fanon and his interlocutors argue that race is the central function of the larger fields of Western philosophy and science, even if race is not mentioned at all. To make this claim, they largely point toward two tendencies in Western thought. First, Fanon and his interlocutors often examine the centrality of time and space in modern Western philosophy. Indeed, much of Western philosophy and science has implicitly and explicitly examined time as a linear trajectory that is largely monopolized by the Western European and North American white male subject; alternatively, space has been theorized as the static and nondynamic measure of the Western subject’s capacity to progress. Second, Fanon and his interlocutors also critically interrogate the related discussion of mutual recognition that is assumed in much of Western thought. As such, Western thinkers have often contended that, historically, the self recognizes itself in the other, and vice versa, and that self/other relationship is the basis for concepts of subjectivity. Yet, Fanon and his interlocutors have also pointed out that the lack of recognition of black people as human or as subjects has done little to foreclose whiteness as the position overrepresented as the human. Rather than recognition, white people have historically enacted racial violence against black bodies as a central mode through which to enter into humanity. As such, time and space and the lack of recognition as outlined by Fanon and his interlocutors suggest that nonwhite bodies have always provided a crisis for Western concepts of universality and subjecthood."

10.1515/rem-2015-0003,A tale about Zen philosophy and a motorcycle (that is: OER & MOOC quality),"Abstract
The paper introduces the concept of education quality, mainly based on a shared culture, that is a background for a permanent reflection on a process in which teachers, students, and stakeholders are involved, in a gradual improvement of their competence. People can achieve quality if they head for an open, participatory, iterative trajectory towards personal identity construction through the achievement of satisfaction of a well done work. In this context measurement tools and final quality controls are only a means “toward the end of satisfying the peace of mind of those responsible for the work” (Pirsig, first edition 1974, 2005, p.304).
The also describes the Open Educational Resources and Massive Open Online Courses phenomenon, and presents the most recent studies about the theoretical framework and practical tools available in the scientific literature to scaffold the quality evaluation of open education. The discussion, taking full advantage of the literature presented, recognises that we are still in the infancy of the Open Education quality evaluation, and that the available tools have still to demonstrate their value in the application's fields, through empirical researches."

There is, however, something to be said for it because it is really only provocative against a certain philosophical backdrop. Our understanding of the concept ""argument"" is both reflected by and molded by the specific  metaphor that argument-is-war, something with winners and losers, offensive and defensive moments, and an essentially adversarial structure. Such arguments may be suitable for teaching a philosophy, but not for teaching philosophy. Surely, education and philosophy do not need to be conceived as having an adversarial essence-if indeed they are thought to have any essence at all. Accordingly, philosophy and education need more pragmatic goals than even Pierce's idealized notion of truth as the end of inquiry, e.g., the simple furtherance of inquiry. For this, new metaphors for framing and understanding the concept of argumentation are needed, and some suggestions in that direction will be considered."
10.2307/280931,Hermeneutics and Archaeology: On the Philosophy of Contextual Archaeology,"In this paper we situate and discuss critically Ian Hodder's contextual archaeology in relation to a broader tradition of philosophical hermeneutics. We argue that Hodder's position comes close to the romantic conception of interpretation developed by German philosophers and historians. Central to this position is the equation of meaning and intention, context and origin, making historical understanding a transaction between the creative consciousness of the prehistoric agents and the receptive or reconstructive consciousness of the archaeologist. Drawing on Gadamer's critique of early hermeneutics we argue that Hodder's contextual archaeology disregards the dialectic between past and present horizons, a dialectic embedded in past material culture itself lying before us as present traces of a past."

For many, he shared as the father of scientific medicine. Unfortunately, we have only eighteen texts written for him and only five fragments of texts written by him. This saved extracts and testimonies they refer mostly to physiology, epistemology and psychology. Was born in the city of Croton (Κρότων) in Magna Graecia (southern Italy) was a reference point for the activity of physicians and philosophers over the years. Furthermore, Herodotus tells us about the excellent practice quality of the physicians, “compared to all the others known in that period”, among which Alcmaeon. But Croton is also famous as the centre of thought and activity of the philosopher Pythagoras of Samos (Πυθαγόρας ὁ Σάμιος, 580-500 BC) through his Pythagorean school around 530 BC."
10.2307/421117,19th Century Logic Between Philosophy and Mathematics,"Abstract
            The history of modern logic is usually written as the history of mathematical or, more general, symbolic logic. As such it was created by mathematicians. Not regarding its anticipations in Scholastic logic and in the rationalistic era, its continuous development began with George Boole's The Mathematical Analysis of Logic of 1847, and it became a mathematical subdiscipline in the early 20th century. This style of presentation cuts off one eminent line of development, the philosophical development of logic, although logic is evidently one of the basic disciplines of philosophy. One needs only to recall some of the standard 19th century definitions of logic as, e.g., the art and science of reasoning (Whateley) or as giving the normative rules of correct reasoning (Herbart).
            In the paper the relationship between the philosophical and the mathematical development of logic will be discussed. Answers to the following questions will be provided:
            1. What were the reasons for the philosophers' lack of interest in formal logic?
            2. What were the reasons for the mathematicians' interest in logic?
            3. What did “logic reform” mean in the 19th century? Were the systems of mathematical logic initially regarded as contributions to a reform of logic?
            4. Was mathematical logic regarded as art, as science or as both?"

The six component model of the content of the PI is used in the study. According to this model, the questionnaire “School Teacher Professional Identity” was created and international survey organized in 2017, in which 433 schoolteachers from Latvia and the Smolensk region of Russia participated. The aim of this article is to analyze the data of two national samples for the first component of the schoolteacher PI: Philosophy of the Profession. The data in both samples show very high support for the basic values and beliefs of the profession. The answers of the teachers of the two countries are well agreed, however certain differences in the data of Latvian and Russian teachers are observed. Some problems of the schoolteacher PI are identified that require attention of teachers, school administrators and education officials."
